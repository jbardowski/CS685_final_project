Our Responsible Supply Chain 

(RSC)↗ program strives to 

empower workers and protect the

1. Prior to 2021, values were rounded and totals were calculated before rounding throughout this report.

2. “Other data center-related facilities” includes facilities where Meta used less than 100,000 MWh of electricity in the reporting year, such as 

warehouses or colocation facilities. Owned, online data centers are always reported by site, even if they were below this threshold.

3. Meta’s methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions can be found on page 57.

4. Prior to 2018, Scope 3 emissions included only business travel, employee commute and construction. Meta includes emissions from all relevant 

categories in Scope 3 for reporting years 2019 to the present.

5. In the 2022 reporting year, several updates to reporting were applied to the 2021 and later inventories.

(a) Data from life cycle assessments for our hardware and sold products were used to calculate our Scope 3 emissions. 
(b) 2021 category 1, 2, 8, & 11 emissions were recalculated with higher quality data inputs to improve accuracy. 
(c) All Scope 3 Categories were broken out individually to improve transparency and eliminate the previously reported “Other Applicable 
Categories” 
(d) Emissions associated with third-party construction-related energy usage were recategorized into Category 1 instead of Category 3 to better 
align with the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Category Boundaries. 
(e) Emissions associated with overhead electricity load at leased data centers was recategorized into Category 8 Instead of Category 3 to better 
align with the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Category Boundaries. 
(f) 2021 Category 6 emissions were recalculated to incorporate more accurate and transparent methodologies for applying sustainable aviation fuel 
emissions reductions. 
(g) 2021 Total Fuel and Energy Consumption were recalculated to eliminate third-party party construction-related fuel use outside of Meta’s 
Operational Control.

6. In the 2019 reporting year, three updates to reporting were applied to 2017 (baseline year) and later inventories:

(a) Vehicles operated by the Transportation Team in support of commuting and inter-campus travel were previously counted in Scope 3 – Employee 

commute. After re-visiting Meta’s operational control of these vehicles, it was determined that they should be accounted for in Scope 1. 

(b) It was determined that Meta overestimated natural gas emissions by including estimates for offices that do not in fact use natural gas. 

Recalculations have been applied to the inventory to remove these inaccuracies. 

(c) Fugitive emissions from refrigerant losses at offices not under Meta operational control were moved from Scope 2 to Scope 3.

Environmental methodology

At Meta, our sustainability work helps us to operate efficiently and responsibly in our mission to build 

community and bring the world closer together. As a global company, we recognize the tech industry’s 

environmental impact and role to play in addressing climate change. We embrace the responsibility to 

understand the full scope of our footprint and be transparent and accountable in our mission to reduce  

our emissions. 

SCOPE 1 EMISSIONS
Direct emissions from our 
data centers, offices and 
transportation fleet

•  Stationary combustion (e.g., natural gas consumed at our Menlo 

Park campus for heating)

•  Mobile combustion (e.g., diesel emissions from our intercampus 

shuttles)

•  Fugitive emissions (e.g., refrigerant losses)

•  Purchased electricity

•  District heating

•  Stationary combustion from leased sites

Identifying the source of our emissions on an annual basis enables us to prioritize emissions reduction 

where we can make the most meaningful progress on our path to net zero emissions across our value 

chain in 2030. Similarly, minimizing our water use, being transparent with our water data, and restoring 

water in the same watersheds where our data centers are located are vital to reach our commitment to 

SCOPE 2 EMISSIONS
Indirect emissions from 
purchased energy for our data 
centers and offices

restore more water than we use by 2030.

Meta’s GHG emissions 

Meta’s GHG footprint includes the emissions associated with running our business and data centers, as 

well as the indirect emissions upstream and downstream of our operations. These emissions correspond 

to Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions as defined by the World Resources Institute (WRI) Greenhouse 

Gas Protocol↗. Meta uses the operational control approach when calculating our GHG footprint, in which 

we account for 100% of the GHG emissions over which we have operational control.

OPERATIONAL EMISSIONS 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions are considered our operational emissions. Scope 1 emissions come from our direct 

operations, such as combustion of natural gas to heat our offices and the fuel burned in our employee 

shuttles. Scope 2 includes indirect emissions from purchased energy, such as the electricity powering our 

data centers. We consider purchased electricity for construction and overhead electricity within leased 

data centers outside of our operational control and therefore report these in Scope 3. 

In 2020, Meta reduced our operational emissions by 94% from a 2017 baseline and addressed the residual 

emissions with high-quality carbon removal projects. As a result, Meta’s operations have produced net zero 

emissions since then.

FULL VALUE CHAIN EMISSIONS 
Scope 3 emissions come from sources within our full value chain beyond our operations and comprise the 

largest component of our footprint. Scope 3 includes:

1.  Upstream emissions, such as the emissions from manufacturing our data center servers or emissions 

from employee commutes; and

2. Downstream emissions, such as the emissions associated with people using our Portal or Quest devices.

Meta is aligning our emissions reduction targets with the Science Based Targets initiative↗ and takes a

scientific, standardized approach to calculating its GHG emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol↗. 

•  Capital goods (e.g., server hardware)

•  Fuel and energy-related activities

Furthermore, Meta’s GHG emissions data and methodologies undergo third party verification each year. 

This is completed annually to ensure that only the most accurate and up-to-date data is publicly reported.

•  Upstream transportation and distribution (e.g., emissions 

We quantify our GHG emissions via activity data, LCAs and financial data. We prioritize calculating our 

associated with the transportation of AR/VR-related consumer 
hardware)

emissions through activity data that directly measures an activity that results in GHG emissions, such 

as kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity. Due to the complex nature of our business and value chain, we use 

•  Waste generated from our operations

•  Business travel

•  Employee commuting (including telecommuting)

•  Upstream leased assets (Including leased data center overhead 

electricity use)

Downstream:

other methods to help calculate our emissions when activity data is not available.

We measure our emissions by metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, 
or CO2e, units. CO2e is used to standardize the emissions from different 
GHGs based on their global warming potentials.

•  Downstream transportation and distribution

For activity data, we take the quantity of a specific measured activity and multiply it by an associated 

•  Direct use of our AR/VR-related consumer hardware

emissions factor to calculate the total emissions from that activity. For example, the kWh of electricity 

•  End-of-life treatment of our AR/VR-related consumer hardware

consumed at a Meta site is multiplied by the appropriate country-specific or regional-specific, publicly 

ACTIVITY DATA 

available emissions factor to calculate the total emissions from that site’s electricity use. We use activity 

data to calculate:

•  Scope 1 and 2 emissions

•  Business travel (including radiative forcing)

•  Fuel and energy-related activities 

•  Employee commuting

•  Waste generated in operations

•  Direct use of our AR/VR-related consumer

A core focus of Meta’s renewable energy program is adding new renewable energy projects to the 

electricity grids that support our data centers to drive the transition to renewable energy in our 

communities. In alignment with these principles, Meta adheres to the following EAC market boundaries:

•  Cradle-to-gate emissions of our augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, such as 

Portal and Quest devices

2. Leased data centersD: EACs from the same grid region or same geographic regionE

For our data centers, we determine our water consumption via two methods:

Each year, we calculate the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) of our 

data centers. PUE measures how efficiently our data centers consume the energy to operate our servers

Annual WUE is calculated by dividing our water withdrawal, in liters, by IT electricity load, in kWh. The 

closer WUE is to “0”, the more efficient consumption of water to cool our IT-related infrastructure. 

These metrics are calculated based on best available data, including internal meters, design estimates, and 

utility bills where applicable.

But reaching net zero emissions in our operations is not enough.

Meta’s responsibility to decarbonize our footprint extends beyond our data centers and offices.

Agreement , we have set a goal to reach net zero emissions across our value chain in 2030.

We removed 80,000 tons of CO2 through carbon removal projects to cover our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

In fact, our emissions reduction from initiatives such increased 46% in 2022 due as our procurement of 100% to Meta employees returning renewable energy.

In the coming to offices and because our years, we will build upon the business growth accelerated at strong foundation for emissions a faster pace than we can scale reduction we have set in 2022 decarbonization measures.

We are already seeing tangible results in our push to decarbonize our operations.

Our 2022 market based emissions were 39% smaller than our location based emissions (14 M tons CO2e).

Our market based emissions adjust for emissions reductions from purchasing decisions we have made.

At Meta, our sustainability work helps us to operate efficiently and responsibly in our mission to build community and bring the world closer together.

As a global company, we recognize the tech industry’s environmental impact and role to play in addressing climate change.

We embrace the responsibility to understand the full scope of our footprint and be transparent and accountable in our mission to reduce our emissions.

Stationary combustion (e.g., natural gas consumed at our Menlo.

Mobile combustion (e.g., diesel emissions from our intercampus shuttles).

Identifying the source of our emissions on an annual basis enables us to prioritize emissions reduction where we can make the most meaningful progress on our path to net zero emissions across our value chain in 2030.

Indirect emissions from purchased energy for our data centers and offices restore more water than we use by 2030.

Meta’s GHG footprint includes the emissions associated with running our business and data centers, as well as the indirect emissions upstream and downstream of our operations.

Meta uses the operational control approach when calculating our GHG footprint, in which we account for 100% of the GHG emissions over which we have operational control.

Scope 1 and 2 emissions are considered our operational emissions.

Scope 1 emissions come from our direct operations, such as combustion of natural gas to heat our offices and the fuel burned in our employee shuttles.

Scope 2 includes indirect emissions from purchased energy, such as the electricity powering our data centers.

We consider purchased electricity for construction and overhead electricity within leased data centers outside of our operational control and therefore report these in Scope 3.

In 2020, Meta reduced our operational emissions by 94% from a 2017 baseline and addressed the residual emissions with high quality carbon removal projects.

As a result, Meta’s operations have produced net zero emissions since then.

Scope 3 emissions come from sources within our full value chain beyond our operations and comprise the largest component of our footprint.

Downstream emissions, such as the emissions associated with people using our Portal or Quest devices.

Meta is aligning our emissions reduction targets with the Science Based Targets initiative and takes a purchased office supplies) scientific, standardized approach to calculating its GHG emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol .

Furthermore, Meta’s GHG emissions data and methodologies undergo third party verification each year.

This is completed annually to ensure that only the most accurate and up to date data is publicly reported.

Upstream transportation and distribution (e.g., emissions.

We quantify our GHG emissions via activity data, LCAs and financial data.

We prioritize calculating our associated with the transportation of AR VR related consumer hardware) emissions through activity data that directly measures an activity that results in GHG emissions, such as kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity.

Upstream leased assets (Including leased data center overhead electricity use).

Downstream: other methods to help calculate our emissions when activity data is not available.

We measure our emissions by metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO2e, units.

CO2e is used to standardize the emissions from different GHGs based on their global warming potentials.

Direct use of our AR VR related consumer hardware emissions factor to calculate the total emissions from that activity.

End of life treatment of our AR VR related consumer hardware consumed at a Meta site is multiplied by the appropriate country specific or regional specific, publicly.

Upstream transportation and distribution where supplier specific data is available hardware.

We have publicly committed to supporting its global operations with 100% renewable energy.

For example, the weight of waste at several Meta sites is used as a proxy to estimate waste at other sites in the same region that do not have final waste weight data.

LCAs To understand cradle to gate emissions and or upstream emissions that are released before certain assets and retire one Energy Attribute Certificate (EAC) for every MWh of electricity used to power our global operations.

Cradle to gate emissions in key data center hardware components, such as hard drives.

End of life treatment of our AR VR related consumer hardware.

Scope 2 emissions, including for all Scope 2 emissions from our owned data centers.

Scope 2 emissions are not covered by EACs within the GHG Protocol’s market boundaries set forth, but industry specific emission factors (e.g., kg CO2e per dollar spent on electronic manufacturing) published by are instead covered by EACs from within the same geographic region.

Upstream Leased Assets, and United States based electricity consumption from our products in Category 11: Use of Sold Products.

Owned data centers include all completed data centers owned and operated by Meta.

D. For reporting year 2022, all leased data center load was in the United States and covered by EACs generated in country.

The water that we use in our offices and at our data centers are withdrawn from our local water utilities climate work will evolve and improve each year.

We have disclosed our Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the or local aquifers.

We report our water withdrawals based on data from our local water utilities or meter last decade.

We began reporting on some Scope 3 categories in 2015 and have reported on every relevant data, where available.

We also report our water withdrawal during construction, based on reported data category defined by the GHG Protocol since 2019.

As techniques to calculate our emissions improve, we from our construction partners.

Not included in Meta’s 2022 operational water withdrawal numbers are an will apply those methods to previous years to refine our GHG footprint.

For example, in 2020 we used the additional 1,780,000 cubic meters of water withdrawn for the construction of Meta data centers.

EPA’s updated EEIO emission factors for our Scope 3 calculations and updated our 2019 data accordingly.

Going forward, we will focus on increasing accuracy and granularity of our data.

For our data centers, we determine our water consumption via two methods: consumer hardware.

We will use activity data for more emissions categories as methods to do so become available.

We will continue reporting and updating our emissions boundaries as our business grows on our path to net zero emissions.

For our offices, we estimate our water consumption based on industry averages.

All of our wastewater is discharged to local wastewater facilities.

Each year, we calculate the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) of our data centers.

It is calculated by dividing the energy consumed at the data center by IT electricity load.

We use water stress metrics in the WRI’s Aqueduct tool to conduct initial assessments of our water risks.

When appropriate, we increase the level of water risk based on additional local knowledge.

Annual WUE is calculated by dividing our water withdrawal, in liters, by IT electricity load, in kWh. The closer WUE is to 0 , the more efficient consumption of water to cool our IT related infrastructure.

These metrics are calculated based on best available data, including internal meters, design estimates, and utility bills where applicable.

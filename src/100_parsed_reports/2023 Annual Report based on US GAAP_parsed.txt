Our overall performance in 2023
Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our own 
operations – Manufacturing and buildings
Scope 3 emissions from our own operations – 
Business travel and commuting
Scope 3 emissions from our supply chain 
(including logistics)
Scope 3 emissions from product use at our 
customers

As the world turns to technology to help solve its pressing 
challenges, our goal is to expand the availability of 
computing power and data storage capability while reducing 
the environmental footprint of our operations, our supply 
chain, and from the use of our products and services. 

The growing demand for enhanced chip functionality means 
that the complexity and energy consumption of the overall 
microchip patterning process is increasing. Aiming for net 
zero emissions across our entire value chain by 2040 while 
energy demand is increasing is a complex challenge that 
can only be achieved by working closely with our partners, 
suppliers, customers and other stakeholders.

Our ambition is to achieve carbon neutrality with net zero 
emissions across our manufacturing and buildings 
(scope 1 and 2) by 2025. With regard to scope 3, we aim 
to achieve net zero emissions from business travel and 
commuting (travel to and from work) by 2025, in our 
supply chain (scope 3 upstream) by 2030, and from the 
use of our products and services by customers (scope 3 
downstream) by 2040.

How we’re managing 
our impact

Our goal is to reduce our climate impacts, working 
closely together with our peers in the entire 
semiconductor value chain – in our own operations 
together with our suppliers, in our customers’ production 
process and through reducing the energy used by 
semiconductors in operation by enabling scaling. 

Increasing energy efficiency is one of the key levers – our 
efforts range from optimizing the technical installations in 
our buildings to supplying more energy-efficient products 
(in terms of energy spent per wafer exposure) to 
customers. Other ways we are working to reduce our 
GHG emissions include reducing business travel, 
commuting more sustainably, using renewable electricity 
and minimizing our use of natural gas by reusing waste 
heat and electrification.

We measure our performance 
in the following ways:

• Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions
• Scope 3 CO2e emissions
• Scope 3 CO2e emissions intensity (per €m 

gross profit)

• Scope 3 CO2e emissions intensity (per €m revenue)
• NXE energy use per exposed wafer 

Our environmental management system

We have implemented an environmental management 
system (EMS) to monitor energy use and emissions 
and improve performance and enhance efficiency 
across our global operations. The EMS is integrated 
into the overall environmental, health and safety (EHS) 
management system operated by all ASML facilities. 
This system was recertified for ISO 14001 (the 
standard for environmental management systems) in 
2023 and structured in accordance with ISO 45001 
(the standard for occupational health and safety 
management systems) requirements.

Energy efficiency and climate action (continued)

The diagram below illustrates our journey to net zero emissions in our value chain:

Our journey to net zero emissions in our value chain

We have set a target to achieve net zero emissions in our 
value chain by 2040. Our approach to achieving this is 
based on three principles:

1 Reduce energy use and innovate to achieve greater 

energy efficiency by redesigning our assets, products 
and processes.

2 Aim to lead the shift toward 100% credible, 

renewable energy.

3 Compensate for residual emissions if no reasonable 

other improvement actions are available.

We will need to work closely with our customers, 
suppliers and partners to achieve the milestones in our 
journey to net zero emissions in our value chain.

As part of our journey to net zero emissions, we are a 
signatory to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) 
and we currently have two SBTi-approved near-term 
targets. These are:

• Reduction of 25.2% of our combined scope 1 and 2 
emissions in 2025, compared to base year 2019, 
without offsetting

• Reduction of 35.3% in scope 3 intensity (emissions per 
unit of gross profit) in 2025 compared to 2019, without 
offsetting

2025 Net zero scope 1 and 2 emissions 
from manufacturing and buildings

We use natural gas resulting in direct emissions 
(scope 1). In some parts of the world, we have 
been unable as of yet to buy green electricity. 
This results in local emissions caused by fossil 
power plants (scope 2).

2025 Net zero scope 3 emissions 

from business travel and commuting

Emissions from employees traveling to our 
customers, suppliers and other parts of ASML, 
and from employees traveling to and from work.

2030 Net zero scope 3 emissions 

from our supply chain (including logistics)

A significant portion of our GHG emissions are 
generated indirectly in our supply chain, as we 
mainly assemble modules that we source from 
suppliers. Parts and modules have to be 
transported to us or our customers directly, and 
our assembled systems are shipped from ASML 
premises to customers. As today’s freight 
logistics, especially air transportation, are still 
carbon-intensive, a significant part of our supply 
chain emissions stem from logistics (operated 
by our logistics suppliers).

2040 Net zero scope 3 emissions from product 

use at our customers
The largest portion of our indirect emissions arises 
during use of our systems at customers’ factories. 
Our customers are not always able to use 100% 
renewable electricity to run their business.

Energy efficiency and climate action (continued)

We identify and assess the impact of climate-related 
risks and opportunities using the assessment guidelines 
of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD).

disclosure, available at asml.com

Alongside our efforts to lower our carbon footprint, we 
are committed to using our innovations and digital 
technologies to enable the wider semiconductor industry 
to reduce its overall environmental footprint. 

Our participation in the annual Carbon Disclosure Project 
(CDP) assessment helps steer our environmental 
initiatives. CDP runs the global disclosure system that 
drives actions and transparency for environment impacts. 
Our score in the most recent CDP Climate Change 2023 
questionnaire was B, with C being the global average. 
We continuously aim to improve and execute emissions 
reduction plans throughout the value chain to achieve 
our net zero commitment, aiming to maintain good 
progress in fighting climate change and to be recognized 
by the CDP in the A-list.

How semiconductors support climate action

While we measure and aim to reduce the impacts of our 
operations, supply chain and product use, ASML’s climate 
impacts extend far beyond these areas to include the 
benefits and risks that our technology brings to society. 

The technology pioneered by our R&D teams and 
partners sits at the heart of global digitalization and has 
the potential to transform how we all live and work. We 
enable our customers to innovate the semiconductor 
technologies that can help humanity manage its 
challenges and seize opportunities by facilitating 
sustainable living and mobility, accessible healthcare, food 
security and the transition to renewable energy.  

For example, semiconductors are harnessing, 
converting, transferring and storing energy from 
sources such as solar and wind power as electricity 
and helping to ensure that national power grids are 
both responsive and robust. 

Mitigating climate change means reducing energy 
demand by developing end-use applications that are 
as energy efficient as possible. Digital technology can 
help businesses and citizens cut energy consumption 
and save money. Smart sensors can detect room 
occupancy, allowing lights and heating to be switched 
off and on automatically. Smartphone applications 
make it possible for people to remotely control their 
appliances or get from A to B through car-sharing, 
ride-sharing or other demand-driven, flexible ways of 
transportation. And as we transition away from fossil 
fuels, electric vehicles will become the norm and will 
require new, potentially diverse electronic solutions.  

On the adverse side, we acknowledge the effects of 
digital technologies that increase energy demand, such 
as AI, IoT, blockchain and cryptocurrency mining.

1. The guidance from the GHG Protocol – the organization that provides widely used international standards for emissions reporting – is used for the calculation of the emission scope. Market-based conversion factors are used to calculate the scope 2 CO2e emissions in kt. 
2. We report the market-based emissions after purchase of renewable electricity – the electricity is proven emission-free by tracking energy attribute certificates. ASML currently does not compensate any emissions, resulting in no differences between our gross and net emissions.
3. The 2023 figure includes nine months of actual data and three months of estimates. The 2022 figure has been adjusted with data for the entire year (11,900 kt best estimate in the 2022 Annual Report). The 2021 figure has been adjusted to report the exact figure instead of a rounded figure.
4. Since 2023, when we measure the energy efficiency of our DUV immersion and DUV dry systems, the laser is included within the measurement. The comparative figures have been revised.
5. In 2021, we started a new master plan period for 2021-2025, with a target to achieve 100 TJ energy savings by the end of 2025. The savings reported are cumulated compared with the base year; therefore, they are not comparable between years.
6. The baseline figure of the NXE:3400B energy use per exposed wafer pass has been corrected, from 13.08 kWh to 12.8 kWh, due to an incorrect rounding being used in the past.

Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our own operations – Manufacturing and buildings

How we’re managing 
our impact

As we work toward net zero emissions in our value chain, 
our most immediate task is to manage the climate 
impacts of our own operations and buildings.  

Scope 1 emissions comprise direct CO2 emissions 
from use of fossil fuels – mainly natural gas – in our 
operations. The majority of natural gas consumption is 
used for heating our buildings and for humidification of 
our cleanrooms.

Scope 2 emissions arise from our purchased electricity, 
which accounts for 80% of the energy we use at ASML. 
Most of our electricity consumption relates to the 
manufacturing of chipmaking equipment – assembly and 
testing of lithography, metrology and inspection systems 
– and maintaining consistent climate conditions such as  
temperature, humidity and air quality.

We aim to achieve our targets for scope 1 and 2 by:

1 Reducing energy consumption

2 Using renewable energy

3 Compensating CO2 emissions

Our targets and performance 
in 2023

Our target is to achieve net zero scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 2025. This target exceeds the reductions 
needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C. We report 
market-based emissions after purchase of renewable 
electricity – the electricity is proven emission-free by 
tracking energy attribute certificates (EACs).

Despite an increase in our electricity and gas 
consumption due to company growth of 30.2%, the 
share of renewable electricity remained comparable to 
2022 at around 91.4%. 

For the third year in a row, our net scope 1 and 2 CO2 
emissions have decreased – from 39.4 kt in 2021 and  
38.1 kt in 2022 to 35.1 kt in 2023. This decrease in 2023 
was due to a combination of business growth (2 kt) and 
adding process CO2 emissions (1 kt) to scope 1 
reporting, consistent with reporting guidelines, 
compensated by a 4.9 kt reduction in Taiwan following a 
change in contract in 2022 to reduce our CO2 (reduction 
of CO2 emission scope 2), and a 1.1 kt reduction due to 
our energy savings master plan.

Our actions in 2023

1. Reducing energy consumption and use of natural gas 

Our energy-saving master plan covers each of our five 
largest industrial sites and includes over 80 projects. It 
aims to reduce energy consumption through direct 
annual savings of at least 100 TJ (or 5 kt CO2e). The 
main components of the master plan are improving the 
efficiency of our technical installations used for our 
operation, and optimizing our portfolio by building new 
offices that meet the latest green building standards, 
such as BREEAM (Building Research Establishment 
Environmental Assessment Method) in Europe, LEED 
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) in the 
US or G-SEED (Green Standard for Energy and 
Environmental Design) in South Korea. We are also 
investing in renewable energy production at our sites.

Reducing our use of natural gas is a key objective. We 
have a multi-year project to implement an energy grid to 
reuse waste heat from our factories and offices on our 
site in Veldhoven. The energy grid is a two-pipe loop that 
makes waste heat available for heating in winter and 
energy-efficient cooling in summer. Based on our plans, 
we estimate that the use of natural gas in Veldhoven will 
be reduced from around 4.9 million m3 to around 1.2 
million m3 in the next three to four years, driven by the 
energy grid and other energy-saving measures.

As we grow as a company, we strive to optimize our real 
estate portfolio because our buildings account for a 
significant percentage of our scope 1 and 2 emissions.

When building new offices and manufacturing sites, 
we seize the opportunity to make them sustainable, 
and several of our existing buildings have been assessed 
for performance against BREEAM guidelines. Two 
additional buildings in the Netherlands achieved a 
BREEAM 'Excellent' rating in 2023: our logistic center 
and one large office building. Five more buildings are in 
the process of achieving a BREEAM 'Excellent' rating in 
2024. 

With an eye on future growth, our new campus in 
Veldhoven is being designed with a strong focus on 
sustainability. We are applying the latest building 
sustainability standards to our real estate worldwide, 
wherever possible. Besides the Netherlands, we have 
projects ongoing in South Korea (G-SEED) and Taiwan 
(LEED).

Key projects in 2023

In 2023, as part of our energy savings master plan, we 
executed key projects in the Netherlands, the US and 
Taiwan which resulted in around 16 TJ annual energy 
savings. The total energy savings delivered by projects 
executed between 2021 and 2023 amounted to 47 TJ. 
In 2023, if we include part of the savings realized by 
projects started in 2022 and not accounted for in 
2022, we realized savings of: 
• 11 TJ per year through operationalizing systems of 
the energy grid and implementing H2 venting in two 
manufacturing buildings in Veldhoven 

• 3 TJ per year in Wilton by installing sand filters on 

cooling towers

• 1 TJ in San Diego through the installation of solar 

panels

• 1 TJ in Taiwan factories by optimizing the operation 

of cooling installations and replacing ventilation 
systems

The remaining 31 TJ is from savings realized by 
projects executed in 2021 and 2022.

2. Using renewable energy

We are driving a shift to renewable energy by increasing 
the share of direct green energy purchases (so-called 
bundled renewable electricity) from renewable electricity 
generated close to our premises. In the Netherlands, we 
are in the third year of a 10-year purchase agreement for 
green electricity for our installations. This enables us to 
achieve our goal of using 100% renewable electricity in 
the country. In 2023, 100% of the electricity used in our 
US and Chinese facilities was also from renewable 
sources. 

In 2023, we managed to secure a long-term power 
purchase agreement (PPA) in Taiwan. The contract will 
be operational in 2024 and help us with our aim to 
reduce our emissions, with 16 kt on a yearly basis as of 
2025. We continue to face challenges in South Korea, 
where there is little to no credible renewable electricity.

100%

of the electricity used in the EU, US and China 
was from renewable sources

3. Compensating for CO2 emissions
We aim to reduce energy consumption and use 
renewable energy as much as possible. Where this is not 
feasible, we intend to purchase voluntary emission 
reduction certificates (VERs) no later than 2025. 

Promoting industry-wide collaboration to reduce GHG emissions across the value chain 

Established in November 2022 with ASML as a 
founding member, the Semiconductor Climate 
Consortium aims to address the challenges of climate 
change and speed up the industry’s efforts to reduce 
GHG emissions throughout the value chain. 
Founding members have affirmed their support of the 
Paris Agreement and related accords driving the 1.5⁰C 
pathway. 

The consortium’s members are committed to working 
toward the following pillars and objectives:

Transparency – Publicly report progress and scope 
1, 2 and 3 emissions annually

Ambition – Set near- and long-term decarbonization 
targets with the aim of reaching net zero emissions 
by 2040
Collaboration – Align on common approaches, 
technology innovations and communication channels 
to continuously reduce GHG emissions

by reducing the carbon footprint stemming from 
electricity usage for semiconductor manufacturing 
and for powering chips in electronics devices.

3.Investment and innovation to solve remaining 16%: 
Reducing emissions from the supply chain and from 
manufacturing process gases will require 
considerable R&D, necessitating investments now.

4.Future manufacturing emissions scenarios: Current 

government and company commitments will 
substantially reduce manufacturing emissions, but 
they are still forecasted to overshoot the carbon 
budget for the 1.5°C pathway.

5.Dilemma of value chain emissions: Digital 

technologies that require semiconductors play a 
crucial role in reducing energy use and emissions 
across industries while simultaneously adding to the 
overall carbon footprint.

Read more at the Semiconductor Climate Consortium (SCC) 
website

On September 20, 2023, the SCC published its first report 
providing an in-depth analysis of the semiconductor value 
chain’s carbon footprint and priority-ranked carbon emission 
sources for the industry to address. The main takeaways 
include:

1.Baseline of value chain emissions: Semiconductor 
devices produced in 2021 have a lifetime CO2e 
footprint of 500 Mt – 16% from supply chain, 21% 
from manufacturing and 63% from device use.

2.Low-carbon energy is a key lever: Bold and decisive 

investments in low-carbon energy sources can 
address more than 80% of industry emissions primarily

How we get to net zero emissions by 2025

Looking ahead

Our energy savings master plan will continue to provide 
savings in 2024-2025. In 2024, we expect an 
acceleration of the energy-saving projects in the five-year 
energy master plan. These include installation of solar 
panels in San Diego that are expected to lead to 8 TJ per 
year savings in 2024, while the operationalization of the 
energy grid and renovation of buildings in the 
Netherlands are expected to lead to an additional 25 TJ 
per year at the end of 2024. We believe that this will 
enable us to achieve our target of 100 TJ (or 5 kt CO2e) 
per year by 2025.

We have signed a five-year Corporate Power Purchase 
Agreement (CPPA) in Taiwan with the aim of providing 
our operations there with about 70% renewable 
electricity in 2024. Since we do not use gas in Taiwan, 
our ambition is to reach 100% renewable by the end of 
2025. While the renewable electricity market in South 
Korea is limited, we will continue to look for alternative 
solutions to procure renewable energy in South Korea 
and will use offsetting in case we are not able to reach 
our net zero target. 

In the coming years, we plan to expand the use of solar 
panels on our sites in EMEA, the US and Asia. We aim to 
have more than 20,000 solar panels on our roofs by 
2025. This would give us a total energy saving of around 
40 TJ per year and a total CO2 emission reduction of 
around 5 kt per year. This is equivalent to the energy use 
of (on average) 3,900 households per year, taking 2,100 
cars off the road or planting around 250,000 new trees 
(around six trees for every ASML employee).

Lastly, we are working on a plan for compensating our 
emissions to reach net zero scope 1 and 2 emissions by 
2025.

We will also work toward reporting on the environmental 
footprint of our approximately 160 buildings globally, 
which include ASML-owned buildings such as 
manufacturing buildings, offices and a few warehouses 
and buildings leased by ASML.  

In 2023, we identified our impact on the environment 
through emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane 
volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and hydrogen (H2) 
from manufacturing as a new material topic. We are 
developing a process to formally manage and report this 
topic starting in 2024.

Scope 3 emissions: An introduction

Reducing upstream and downstream scope 3 emissions

Scope 3 emissions include both upstream and downstream 
activities and comprise the emissions that are generated in 
our supply chain, through business travel and commuting, 
and through use of our products at our customers. We 
measure progress in reducing our scope 3 emissions by 
emission intensity, i.e. total scope 3 emissions (tonnes CO2e) 
against total gross profit (€ millions).

Our overall target for 2025 is to reduce the intensity of 
scope 3 emissions to 1,016 tonnes CO2e per € million 
gross profit, in line with our SBTi commitment. This 
represents a 35.3% intensity reduction compared 
with 2019. 

Our scope 3 intensity for 2023 was 1,060 tonnes CO2e 
per € million gross profit (2022: 1,116 tonnes). Our 
results indicate that the scope 3 emissions account for 
15.0 Mt, or 99.8%, of our total emissions footprint (scope 
1, 2 and 3). Of this, 5.5 Mt are ‘upstream’ emissions 
(mainly related to the goods and services we buy and 
ship), 0.1 Mt are from business travel and commuting, 
and 9.4 Mt are indirect ‘downstream’ emissions (use of 
sold products at our customers’ sites). As of 2023, we 
report indirect climate change effects of air travel 
(radiative forcing, non-CO2 emissions) separately and not 
as part of our scope 3 emissions. This is to align with 
current reporting practices of airlines and in line with 
recommendations from SBTi. This has resulted in 
comparative figures being updated.

indicators – Energy efficiency and climate action

Our overall emissions are increasing due to the growth 
of ASML. We expect emissions to continue rising in the 
short term due to our continued growth and more 
complex products. To ensure that we meet our 
ambition for net zero emissions by 2040, we need to 
work closely with our value chain partners, for example 
on increasing the capacity of renewable electricity in 
some regions of the world.

We are still on track to achieve our SBTi target of 1,016  
tonnes CO2e per € million gross profit in 2025.

On the following pages you can read more about how 
we're tackling scope 3 emissions specifically related to 
business travel and commuting, our supply chain, and 
through the use of our products by customers.

Our overall target for 2025 is to reduce 
the intensity of scope 3 emissions to 
1,016 tonnes CO2e per € million gross 
profit, in line with our SBTi commitment.

Scope 3 emissions from our own operations – Business travel and commuting

Looking ahead
For 2024, we aim to strengthen our partnership with 
KLM to further reduce our emissions from aviation so 
that we will be able to meet ASML's ambition of net zero 
CO2 emissions in 2025 for business travel.

The year will also see us commence a project that will 
better quantify emissions from employee commuting in 
our operating regions outside the Netherlands. This is 
likely to lead to targeted interventions to further reduce 
the commuting emissions in later years.

Where there are no alternatives, we aim to offset our 
residual emissions from employee commuting and 
business travel by purchasing VERs in the coming years. 

How we’re managing 
our impact

We are using the following levers, aiming to reduce our 
impact:

• Business travel: Reducing the volume of business 

travel through stricter policies, raising awareness and 
use of remote working and servicing options.

• Commuting: To reduce the percentage of car commutes 

in our Veldhoven region (NL), we focus on developing a 
mix of sustainable commuting options by encouraging 
people to travel to work by bicycle or public transport. 
Alongside this, we provide shuttle bus services from 
Park & Ride locations, offer satellite offices and 
promote a balanced working-from-home policy. 

Our targets and performance 
in 2023

Our target is to achieve net zero emissions from business 
travel and commuting by 2025.

In 2023, taking into account Sustainable Aviation Fuel 
(SAF) purchases, our total emissions due to business 
travel and commuting were 70 kt CO2e and 54 kt CO2e, 
respectively (see graphs). Due to the increasing number 
of employees at all locations and the ending of COVID-19 
travel restrictions, our emissions increased by 13% 
compared to 2022 (69 kt CO2e and 41 kt CO2e, 
respectively). Commuting emissions are predominantly 
related to commuting by car. The impact of the indirect 
climate change effects of air travel are excluded from our 
business travel emissions, as explained on the previous 
page.

Our annual emissions (in kt) from business travel (2019-2023)

Our annual emissions (in kt) from commuting (2019-2023)

Our actions in 2023

For business travel, we created and launched a travel 
dashboard for managers to provide clear insights into 
travel cost, broken down into the underlying elements 
such as hotel and air travel. This dashboard aims to drive 
behavioral change, as it also shows the related CO2 
emissions. We reduced our global travel budget per FTE 
by 30% from pre-COVID-19 travel patterns of 2019.

We stimulated green travel modes by encouraging 
employees to use train travel for specific destinations, 
such as Berlin and London. We have launched a project 
aiming to use SAF for air travel. In 2023, ASML 
purchased 4,341 tonnes of SAF, which has avoided 
10,198 tonnes of CO2 emissions. From January 2024, 
we aim to use only electric vehicles in our rental car 
program in Veldhoven.

In 2023, we also joined 'Anders Reizen', a coalition of 
more than 70 organizations in the Netherlands which 
aims to reduce CO2 emissions related to business travel 
and commuting of its members by 50% in 2030 
compared to 2016.

To enable employees in the Netherlands to commute for 
free between their home and work on public transport, 
we provided them with a business card of the Dutch 
railways ('Nederlandse Spoorwegen'). In addition, 
exclusive shuttle bus services have been set up between 
Eindhoven central station and the Veldhoven campus, 
and shared e-bikes are available as a successful, 
sustainable solution.

Scope 3 emissions from our supply chain (including logistics)

How we’re managing 
our impact

Reducing emissions arising from upstream activities in 
our supply chain – for example, by sharing data and 
targets – requires close collaboration with our suppliers 
and other upstream stakeholders.

ESG sustainability has become a major theme in our 
supplier relationships. Our Sourcing & Procurement (S&P) 
ESG sustainability program is a key enabler in our efforts 
to reduce scope 3 emissions by actively engaging and 
collaborating with suppliers, to drive further progress. We 
depend on our suppliers and other upstream value chain 
partners to work with us to jointly reduce our carbon 
footprint.

Our targets and performance 
in 2023

In 2023, total emissions due to upstream activities 
(excluding business travel and commuting) were 5,458 kt 
CO2e, an increase of 14% from 2022 in line with our 
increase in sales (since we use the spend-based 
approach for calculating emissions). Purchased goods 
and services and capital goods contribute to 82% of 
these emissions. Most of the remaining emissions are 
from transportation and distribution.

Looking ahead

One of our future key focuses will be building on the 
supplier GHG emissions baseline – and we will be 
working with our top 100 suppliers toward commitment 
on net zero scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2030. We will also be 
encouraging suppliers to develop roadmaps for 
improving energy efficiency in their production 
processes, using renewable energy and (as a last resort) 
offsetting.

We expect that new EU regulations and other directives 
around mandatory disclosure of scope 3 emissions data 
will help to increase transparency across our supply 
chain, and will result in firm actions to reduce scope 3 
upstream emissions.

Read more in Social – Responsible supply chain

To support the optimization of the design, in the D&E 
ESG sustainability program we will work toward 
improving the data, automating the GHG emissions 
calculations and providing consistent data on the design 
connected to a product roadmap. This will include actual 
supplier data where available. Also, we will aim to have a 
first CO2e footprint estimate available based on the 
design information of an ASML product.

We constantly seek to improve data quality by working 
with our suppliers – for example, while the spend-based 
methodology is useful, it fails to reflect improvements that 
reduce GHG emissions.

In previous years, we have seen a mix of supplier 
maturity levels in reporting scope 1 and 2 emissions 
data. We obtain GHG emissions data (scope 1, 2 and 
limited scope 3) from our suppliers. Our aim is to use this 
information to compare spend-based emissions data 
with actual emissions data, to help drive meaningful 
progress. We learned that spend-based emissions are 
overestimated compared to actual emissions data. As a 
result, our next step to improve data quality is to include 
actual supplier emissions data in our calculations for 
scope 3. 

It will take time before we can reliably assess all our 
suppliers’ scope 3 emissions data, as not all of them 
have visibility of their own supply chain emissions. To 
support them, we have introduced an IT dashboard that 
will capture and display the relevant data.

In 2023, we made progress by requesting CO2e 
emissions data directly from our suppliers through our 
S&P ESG sustainability program. We aim to use this data 
as part of our move from spend-based to hybrid-based 
data.

In 2023 we also improved our knowledge within 
Development and Engineering (D&E) in estimating CO2e 
emissions from our suppliers by building competence on 
life-cycle analysis. We are investigating how to determine 
the impact of the design and have started developing 
tooling for our engineers. With this, we aim at raising 
awareness, finding hotspots in the design and making a 
start with steering for design changes.

Our scope 3 CO2e emissions in the (upstream) supply chain 
(2019-2023)

Our actions in 2023

Improving our scope 3 upstream emissions data 
quality

We calculate our scope 3 emissions using guidance from 
the GHG Protocol – the organization that provides widely 
used international standards for emissions reporting. We 
currently use the spend-based methodology for 
calculating supplier emissions.

Scope 3 emissions from product use at our customers

How we’re managing 
our impact

As demand for enhanced chip functionality grows, 
the complexity and energy consumption of the overall 
microchip patterning process – including that of our 
lithography and metrology and inspection systems – is 
increasing.

To measure CO2e emissions from product use, we 
calculate emissions generated by our customers’ 
electricity usage while operating ASML machines. In line 
with the GHG Protocol, we calculate these emissions 
based on the number of newly installed machines at our 
customers’ sites during the reporting year multiplied 
by the lifetime of the machine (estimated at 20 years).

When we design new systems, we increasingly focus on 
reducing energy consumption and cost, while increasing 
performance and availability. The EUV light source is the 
key focus of our current engineering efforts, because it 
accounts for the largest portion of an EUV system’s total 
energy consumption. In addition, we have started to 
better assess the energy efficiency of our other product 
families – in DUV, metrology and inspection, 
computational lithography, and scanner and process 
control software solutions.

We’re working with peers and partners – including 
through the SCC (read more in our case study on page 
81) – to accelerate efforts to reduce GHG emissions, 
share knowledge and technology and stimulate the 
adoption of renewable energy worldwide. 

Reducing energy consumption by introducing sleep mode in our lithography systems

Semiconductor manufacturing processes are designed 
to maximize the utilization of the critical lithography 
systems. However, there will be times when a system is 
not in use. Up to now, the lithography system has 
remained fully powered on to ensure the system is 
perfectly conditioned at all times to deliver nanometer-
accurate performance.

In order to reduce energy consumption of our systems, 
we have introduced a sleep mode, which allows for 
powering down of subsystems to conserve energy. 
This does affect thermal conditioning of the system, 
which requires a few minutes of reconditioning to get 
the system fully production-ready again.

The key here is to give our customers control over a 
system's state. The customer has insight into when 
these idle periods occur, which enables them to put 
the lithography system into sleep mode without 
impacting wafer output. Triggered by a command from 
the fab automation system, the lithography system 
temporarily powers down some subsystems and then, 
again triggered by fab automation, returns them back 
to production mode in time for the next lot.

Most of the energy of an EUV lithography system is 
used by the CO2 drive laser, so this is a prime 
candidate for introducing our sleep mode solution. In 
the drive laser, CO2 gas is compressed and 
subsequently exited (via nitrogen) by radio frequency 
(RF) generators. A seed laser is used to trigger 
stimulated emission of infrared light, which is 
subsequently used to generate EUV light.

We will soon introduce sleep mode for the RF 
generators. We have developed a software interface 
that allows our customers to send sleep and wake-up 
commands to the system, which power down the RF 
generators via internal control software. This RF sleep 
mode has been tested in-house, confirming the 
energy-saving potential as well as fully meeting system 
specifications immediately after the reconditioning 
sequence. 

RF sleep mode has the potential to reduce EUV 
system energy consumption by approximately 2.5%, 
averaged over time, when utilized in high-volume 
manufacturing at our customers' sites. 

The sleep mode interface will also act as a foundation 
for implementing sleep mode in other sub-modules, 
further increasing the energy-saving potential.

Our targets and performance 
in 2023

Our target is to reduce the overall energy consumption of 
our future-generation EUV systems by 10% compared 
with the 2018 baseline model (NXE:3400B) by 2025, 
while increasing productivity. 

We have also set a 2025 target to reduce the energy 
consumption per exposed wafer by 60%, compared with 
the 2018 baseline (NXE:3400B).

Reaching our targets has our full attention, and we plan 
to measure our NXE:3800E in 2024, which we expect will 
bring us closer to achieving our 2025 target.

Based on the latest measurement of the NXE:3600D, 
energy use per exposed wafer pass was 7.7 kWh (versus 
our NXE platform 2025 target of 5.1 kWh) which shows 
an improvement from the last measurement taken in 
2021 of 8.3 kWh.

Based on the latest measurement of the NXT:1980Fi, 
energy use per exposed wafer pass was 0.52 kWh.

In 2023, total emissions from the use of sold products 
were 9,443 kt CO2e, of which EUV accounted for 5,757 
kt CO2e, DUV for 3,488 kt CO2e and metrology and 
inspection systems for 198 kt CO2e. The emissions have 
increased in line with an increase in sales.

Scope 3 emissions from product use at our customers (continued)

We also worked on improving the data quality of our 
inventory for scope 3 downstream emissions. This year 
we included the use of HMI e-beam inspection systems 
in our inventory. We also included the laser contribution 
into our reported values for DUV systems, as well as the 
process CO2 gas, which is released during operation of 
some of our immersion scanners. Operation and idle time 
were updated to better represent actual usage, based on 
customer data.

Looking ahead

In 2024, we will continue to work on the energy efficiency 
of our systems and other product families. At the 
moment, we see no reason to adjust our 2025 targets 
regarding the energy consumption of our systems.

Our actions in 2023

In 2023, we continued working on energy efficiency 
improvements for future products, which require long 
lead times and take multiple years to achieve. Progress 
on these projects is monitored on a quarterly basis. 

We proved the capability of the NXE:3600D system to 
reach productivity targeting 175 wph (as compared with 
the current specification of 160 wph). In 2024, this will be 
introduced to the market as the NXE:3600 PEP-D 
package.

For our DUV systems, we identified possible energy-
saving options, among others around wafer stage and 
reticle stage magnet innovations, adaptive cooling water 
flows, reducing the power consumption when systems 
are idle (similar to the sleep mode in EUV) and reusing 
the otherwise directly emitted CO2 from the immersion 
hood in our immersion scanners.

For our metrology and inspection systems, we also 
identified possible energy-saving options, among others 
around exhaust management and cooling and creating a 
sleep mode to reduce power consumption when 
systems are idle.

Sustainability is a design 
challenge that must be 
solved in parallel with system 
cost and performance – 
that’s how we will make

Ton van der Net
Principal Architect, D&E
25 years at ASML

A sustainability mindset
Ton van der Net specializes in 
improving the energy efficiency and 
overall sustainability of lithography 
systems. He has been at the forefront 
of ASML’s sustainability efforts as they 
have grown from a team-led initiative to 
a corporate-level commitment that is 
becoming integral to how we develop 
our systems.

Many of that initial team – including myself – 
are still active in driving a sustainable 
innovation culture within ASML. We are 
looking to embed sustainability even more 
fully into ASML’s PGP, because you get 
better results faster and at lower cost if you 
build sustainability in from the start. To this 
end, our system design specifications – the 
handbook for what we want to achieve in a 
new system – now include maximum power 
consumption and a power breakdown as 
standard. By making sustainability part of our 
standard processes, we have switched on 
the innovation power of 20,000 ASML 
engineers.

A greener future

We are also looking at the materials we use 
to build our systems. There are standard 
ways of estimating the sustainability of 
materials in terms of their energy cost to 
produce and recyclability, but they are very 
approximate. We want to develop more 
accurate methods based on actual materials 
and processes. The sustainability of materials 
could then become another driver for 
innovation. 

Sustainable innovation is becoming part of 
our business as usual, just another design 
specification for our engineers alongside 
performance, cost and time to delivery. 
Because, in the end, all those factors must 
be balanced. Our sustainability efforts only 
have value if they come in a system that 
meets our customers’ business needs.

This is quite a radical change in mindset for 
any company. However, publications from 
the likes of McKinsey have shown that 
companies who perform well in sustainability 
typically outperform their competitors in 
market share and brand image. What’s 
more, around this time, ASML announced a 
corporate commitment aiming to have net 
zero emissions in our value chain by 2040. 
And the largest contribution to our current 
carbon footprint is the energy our systems 
use at customers.

We have made good progress toward that 
goal. Between 2018 and 2023, we reduced 
the energy per wafer for EUV lithography by 
almost 40%. And we have a roadmap for 
another 20% of reductions by 2025.

The new normal

Sustainability is now becoming a business 
driver at ASML, due partly to the corporate 
commitment and partly to the internal 
motivation of individuals. Our Green ASML 
employee network has over 2,000 people 
looking at everything from the food we serve 
in the cafeteria to system energy 
consumption. We’ve even had internal 
‘Shark Tank’ style events to generate new 
ideas to make our whole operation more 
sustainable.

Taking the first steps

About seven years ago, in response to 
customers’ concerns, we started looking at 
the scale of the infrastructure, like cooling 
and power, needed to run lithography 
systems. These support facilities needed as 
much space as the production lines. When 
we estimated the total power they required, it 
was huge – around 1.3 MW for our EUV 
systems (as much as a few thousand Dutch 
homes)  – and projected to grow further.

Continuing that trajectory wasn’t 
environmentally responsible. So, a small 
team of ASML engineers – including me – 
started exploring ways to reduce energy 
consumption in lithography. For example, a 
lot of that 1.3 MW went into cooling the 
system and handling the hydrogen flow used 
to prevent contamination build-up. Was all 
that cooling necessary? Could we handle the 
hydrogen more efficiently?

Our initial list of ideas inspired ASML’s first 
KPI for sustainable system development. 
Some of these ideas looked at how the 
systems were used, while others required 
changes to the system. For example, if we 
redesigned the cooling features, customers 
could use warmer cooling water – reducing 
the need for power-hungry chillers.

Building a case for sustainability

Any redesign would need buy-in from the 
business. So, we teamed up with system 
engineering to engage the people who make 
the day-to-day design decisions. These early 
discussions triggered us to build a business 
case for our ideas. That meant thinking – and 
encouraging others to think – about the value 
of our changes beyond purely financial 
terms.

Our circular economy strategy is based on the 
following four principles:

• Prevent waste

• Extend lifetime

• Reuse resources

• Recycle materials

Why it matters

Our materiality assessment identified the impact of our 
use of materials and resources as a material topic – and 
our focus on a circular economy is the cornerstone of our 
commitment to managing this challenge. 

A circular economy enables sustainable economic 
growth by creating business loops, ensuring efficient use 
of resources and driving an innovative business model. 
This approach is an essential part of decoupling our 
growth from the increasing consumption of resources.

Through our circular economy initiative, we aim to ensure 
our products and services retain and create as much 
value as possible for us and our partners in the 
ecosystem. 

How we’re managing 
our impact
A successful transition toward a circular economy means 
improved designs, operational resilience, reduced 
emissions and reduced costs. Improved designs are 
achieved through learning from use cases – both 
successes and failures – to improve products, solutions 
and processes. The availability of parts and access to 
material to support ASML’s growth, while decoupling it 
from material consumption and closing the loops, will be 
key for operational resilience. This will lead to reduced 
emissions through disposing locally and eliminating 
waste ending in incineration, energy recovery and landfill. 
Cost reduction can be achieved by optimizing the 
amount of purchased goods while avoiding surplus and 
reusing resources to eliminate waste. In summary, 
ASML’s approach to circular economy is designing 
products for longevity and reuse, creating closed-loop 
supply chains and encouraging the recycling of materials.

Circular economy (continued)

The diagram on the right illustrates our circular economy 
approach. 

Our circular economy approach 

We have an ambition to reduce waste in our operations:

By 2030, we aim to send zero waste from operations 
to landfill or incineration1.

We have therefore developed a 
strategy which includes the 
following principles:

• Prevent waste from our assets, 
systems and processes by 
redesigning them, in collaboration 
with our suppliers and customers, 
to limit their environmental impact  

• Extend the lifetime and productivity 

of our systems and assets to 
maximize their usage throughout 
their life cycles 

• Reuse resources, parts, tools, 

packaging and goods across the 
value chain  

• Recycle materials if we can no 

longer apply any of the previous 
principles, avoiding incineration and 
landfill 

1. Incineration is defined to include processes with and without energy 

recovery.

Our different types of waste

We measure our impact in tonnes of waste, by 
category (hazardous and non-hazardous) and by 
material type (such as plastics, paper, wood and 
hazardous liquids). We include data on the CO2e 
impact of processing our waste in our scope 3 
emissions. Within our operations, we divide our waste 
into two broad categories: 

Non-hazardous waste, such as packaging material, 
product-related waste from parts resulting from 
upgrades or defects, and general waste. This 
category also includes construction waste from 
building activities – the amount of construction waste 
tends to fluctuate over the years.

Hazardous waste, such as the chemicals we use in 
our manufacturing processes. This can include 
everything from lamps, batteries and liquids to 
cleaning wipes and filters. Most of our hazardous 
waste is in the form of liquids, including acetone and 
piranha acid.

In 2023, we generated 8,932 tonnes of waste from our 
operations overall (including construction waste). This 
was an increase of 29% over 2022 (6,913 tonnes).

In 2023, 43% of the total waste from operations (including 
construction waste) was sent to landfill, incineration with energy 
recovery or incineration (2022: 25%).

Our total waste in 2023

The presence of hazardous materials is a risk to our ability to 
achieve our goal of sending zero waste from operations to 
landfill or incineration. In some countries, there is also the risk 
that our waste hauler may not be able to identify companies 
able to recycle some of our waste. 

Our total amount of waste increased due to ASML’s 
growth, despite the impact of projects to reduce waste. 
However, the amount of waste from operations 
normalized to revenue showed a decrease in 2023.

During the year, 7% of total waste (653 tonnes) was related to 
construction (2022: 238 tonnes, or 3%). The amount of 
construction waste increased compared to 2022. During 2023, 
significant demolition activities were ongoing on our Veldhoven 
main campus.  Since we hand over the responsibility of the 
construction sites to the building contractor, the demolition 
waste is excluded from our waste data. Although we do not 
report on it, we work with our contractors to try to ensure 
maximum recycling of this waste.

Circular economy (continued)
Prevent waste

How we’re managing 
our impact

The first principle of our circular economy is to prevent 
waste. This involves eliminating or limiting waste at its 
source by rethinking and redesigning processes to avoid 
waste, focusing on design, sourcing and quality, among 
others. We aim to design our systems, products and 
processes to maximize their value by focusing on 
commonality, modularity, compatibility, standardization, 
reusability, reliability and recyclability, while opting for 
mono-material components and eco-design 
methodology, minimizing the use of critical raw materials 
like rare earths and hazardous materials.

We aim to collaborate with product- and non-product-
related suppliers that deliver durable and efficient 
products with recycled material, which can be upgraded, 
refurbished, repaired, reused and recycled. We improve 
the quality of our systems by avoiding defects on arrival, 
and implementing lean principles in all processes, 
specifically in manufacturing and logistics, to eliminate 
waste. 

We design our systems to last for as long as possible in 
order to prevent waste. Built-in feedback loops ensure 
that we continuously improve product designs by 
learning from failure modes and repair activities.

We have a team dedicated to ensuring we take a 
sustainable packaging approach that maximizes the use 
of our resources and minimizes waste while ensuring the 
safe transport of our systems. We also have activities 
that aim to minimize waste across the value chain – from 
sourcing to customer support – enabling improvements 
in both hazardous and non-hazardous waste streams. 

We actively prevent waste by agreeing with suppliers of 
IT hardware to deliver in bulk instead of individual 
packaging. This limits the amount of packaging material.

We also focus on preventing waste by agreeing with IT 
suppliers to only ship parts that we actually use. For 
example, the stands were previously included with every 
computer monitor ordered, even though we do not use 
those stands. Now the stands are no longer included in 
the order and therefore not produced by the 
manufacturer, which prevents waste. 

Materials used in EUV sources undergo rigorous 
conditions, including exposure to high temperatures, 
thermal cycling, corrosive liquid tin, high pressures, 
pressure cycling and hydrogen. These materials, such as 
strategic tantalum alloys and molybdenum, are both 
limited in availability and costly. Ongoing trials are 
focused on preventing the use of virgin material by 
extending the lifespan of materials used in the system, 
enhancing material quality in the production process and 
improving application conditions.

Our targets and performance 
in 2023

Although addressing our waste performance is a 
relatively new focus area for us, we have already made 
some progress. For example, while our sales have grown 
by 30.2%, our waste generation from our own operations 
has increased at a lower rate of 24%. 

Read more in Our overall performance in 2023

Our actions in 2023

We have continued to focus on embedding a circular 
approach more deeply in our design processes. By 
thinking about modularity, commonality and repairability 
during the design phase, we can extend the lifetime of 
our machines and increase reuse opportunities for parts 
in the future, aiming to prevent waste. 

We have started a project to embed design for reuse in 
our PGP. This means that, as an example, the PGP 
includes a default design of a repair method for any 
service part. This enables parts in the installed base 
systems to be repaired even after any engineering 
change, so the new functionality may not hinder the 
repairability of the legacy parts.

Modular design of products and components enables 
future upgrades, worn parts and components to be 
replaced as a single unit. In 2023, we successfully 
concluded the first phase of a feasibility study 
demonstrating the manufacturability of modular wafer 
tables, aiming to secure the reusability of over 2,600 
wafer tables by 2028.

We couple learnings from remanufacturing back to the 
design process. In 2023, for example, we improved the 

design of our in-line refill module, which we have been 
remanufacturing since we designed it in our system. 

Another example is the learnings from our local repair 
center team in South Korea. By enabling the repairability 
of one of our alignment lasers, they were able to correct 
for the key failure mode on the ‘shutter’ that lets the light 
out of the laser module.

Commonality in the parts design process enables a part 
to be used in multiple contexts within a product and in 
future product generations.

Looking ahead

Starting from 2024, we aim to have zero waste from 
operations to landfill or incineration from our newly 
designed products, with repair and reuse requirements 
as part of the product requirement specification. This is 
part of our customer proposition. 

In our D&E teams, we will set up a specific ‘repair 
competence', which will enable people to specialize and 
be the subject matter experts in this field. These 
dedicated repair-focused teams will work with all 
functions in D&E and across ASML’s business.  

We are setting up a packaging waste reduction program 
with the aim to reduce waste by 2025, with targets 
toward 2030 under discussion.

In 2024, the feasibility study for modular wafer tables for 
Wilton and Berlin will be finalized.

Circular economy (continued)
Extend the lifetime of our products

How we’re managing 
our impact

As a well-maintained ASML system can last for decades 
and create value for more than one customer, the 
second principle in our circular economy approach is to 
extend the lifetime of our products. 

ASML aims to maintain systems in use as long as 
economically and environmentally possible, focusing on 
service, upgrades and refurbishment of assets, systems 
and goods. We are establishing customer contracts to 
maintain systems in the market for as long as possible, 
maximizing their value and avoiding obsolescence. We 
develop refresh packages to extend the life while 
maintaining a high performance. We develop lifetime 
extension and performance packages – productivity 
enhancement packages (PEPs) and system node 
extension packages (SNEPs) – to enhance the systems’ 
running period and performance.  

We also refurbish systems across the business – our 
refurbishment strategy focuses on buying back systems 
that are not operational in the field, harvesting parts from 
decommissioned systems and managing the continued 
availability of spare parts. This is key to the extended 
lifetime service we offer for our systems. We also re-sell 
systems as long as we can guarantee the parts. 

Once a fab needs to upgrade, an ‘older’ lithography 
system is given a new purpose in a new fab producing 
comparatively less sophisticated chips, such as 
accelerometers or radio-frequency chips. 

We provide our customers with a guaranteed service 
roadmap until at least 2030. This means that all the 
support and necessary services and spare parts required 
to maintain their systems are expected to be available 
until at least 2030, subject to export control limitations.

We focus on refurbishing a number of product families: 
PAS 5500 (with almost 1,800 systems at customer sites 
worldwide), TWINSCAN XT systems (2,000 systems) 
and, as of 2021, NXT:1950-1980 systems (1,000 
systems). For the approximately 200 TWINSCAN AT 
systems that are still in operation, we focus on measures 
to proactively manage their end of life. We do this by 
guaranteeing the availability of spare parts for as long as 
possible and providing customers with sufficient notice if 
we can no longer guarantee part supply.

Our targets and performance 
in 2023

Our target for 2025 is that more than 95% of systems 
sold in the past 30 years should still be active in the field.

To date, we have refurbished and resold almost 570 
lithography systems. As of the end of 2023, 95% (2022: 
95%) of all systems sold in the past 30 years are still 
active in the field.

Looking ahead

Refurbishment is a multi-year program in which we 
continually invest to ensure the supply of more than 
2,000 service parts for our PAS platform. This is 
achieved either through redesigns, harvesting parts or 
finding an alternative with the same form, fit and function. 
Where this is not possible, we are generally able to 
secure components through ‘last time buy’ – a supplier’s 
‘last call’ for a part or component before production 
switches to its successor. When a part is no longer 
available, we redesign the parts. 

In 2023, we acquired a PAS 5500 parts repair company 
in the US that will support our ambition to sustain PAS 
not only through 2030, but also beyond. In addition, we 
intend to extend their capability to accelerate our XT 
parts repair competence.

We track the spare parts in our portfolio to see how they 
are being used and identify when we expect to run out of 
individual items. For PAS and XT systems, we use this 
information to update our priorities for redesign. For 
TWINSCAN AT systems, we aim to continue supplying 
parts by harvesting them from systems that are 
decommissioned by our customers. 

We have identified and plan to execute more than 100 
redesign projects for nearly 300 parts in the coming 
years. This is particularly relevant for electronic parts, for 
which the evolution of technology has been faster than in 
any other field. 

We will continue to increase our focus on local repair to 
extend the life of the mature installed base at lower cost, 
reducing the need to redesign and buy new materials 
and parts.

The refurbishment activities we have been doing for 
years on our PAS systems will be extended to cover both 
XT and NXT systems. We are currently on track to meet 
our target of >95%.

Reuse resources

How we’re managing 
our impact

ASML is committed to reusing parts, packaging, tools 
and non-product-related resources in the value chain, 
focusing on the return, recondition and repurposing 
processes. We optimize return flows by collaborating 
with customers and suppliers, while learning from system 
usage and product returns. We recondition parts and 
packaging through global and local repair centers, 
suppliers and partners, at the best location with the 
lowest environmental impact. We repair buildings, assets 
and infrastructure. We enable the repurposing of parts, 
packaging, tools and devices in a new life cycle inside 
and outside ASML. 

We maximize the reuse of system parts, packaging and 
tools in our value chain to reduce waste and meet 
customer demand. 

Reuse is also a key contributor to our ability to ramp up 
capacity to cope with strong customer demand. We 
retrieve parts from inventory or through repair or 
harvesting.

88%

reuse rate of defective parts, 
up from 87% in 2022

Reuse also offers learning opportunities to improve the 
performance and lifetime of our parts and systems. We 
work closely with our customers and suppliers to embed 
learnings in design and processes throughout the value 
chain.  

We aim to reuse workplace IT assets obtained (e.g. 
monitors) when buildings are decommissioned. Instead 
of assets being disposed of at the end of their economic 
lifespan, they are used to set up work environments in 
other buildings where and when possible.

Key improvement areas

We focus on the following key improvement areas:

• Repair centers: Repair close to where parts are 
needed to improve parts repair yields by reducing 
cycle time of root-cause analysis and repairs.

• Predictable external repair flow: Simplify and 

standardize return and repair flows to enable us to 
scale activities. 

• Circular supplier collaboration: Incentivize 
suppliers to prioritize reuse over new materials.

• Return quality: Ensure that parts are returned with 
reuse in mind – quality returns lead to quality repairs.

• Packaging and transportation tools: Increase 

reuse of packaging, which is the main contributor to 
our waste (from operations).

Our targets and performance 
in 2023

Our overall target is to increase the reuse rate of 
defective parts in ASML factories and in the field to 95% 
by 2025. This means successfully reconditioning at least 
95% of our parts. 

In 2023, our reuse rate of parts was 88%, up from 87% 
in 2022 – on target to achieve our goal. The savings we 
generated from reused parts amounted to €1,311 million 
(2022: €781 million) and the value of scrapped parts was 
€206 million (2022: €146 million).

Our actions in 2023

Repair centers

We are extending the number of repair centers 
worldwide to support the reuse of parts by returning, 
cleaning and reconditioning them close to where they are 
needed. Demand for these parts can be driven by our 
customers needing service parts for their installed base, 
or by our factories requiring parts for new systems.

Currently, we have several repair centers in Asia (South 
Korea, Taiwan and China), the US (Wilton, San Diego) 
and the EU (Veldhoven). We are investigating our options 
to extend our network of local repair centers to other 
locations.

Our repair centers work with local suppliers and 
specialized repair partners to create a local ecosystem. 
By enabling repair and reuse activities and taking 
ownership of repairs close to where materials are 
needed, we are able to reduce logistics time, cost of 
stocking parts and our environmental impact (by 
reducing scrap and GHG emissions). Our customers 
benefit from reduced service costs and improved 
material availability.

In 2023, we launched a dedicated cross-company team 
to further explore local reuse activities in Taiwan, and 
have begun the process of setting up a similar operation 
in the US. We intend to empower local teams to initiate 
reuse activities, as local business requirements and 
situations may vary. The central reuse team provides 
guidance and support where needed and drives roll-out 
of local best practices across other locations.

With over 1,200 m2 of cleanroom, our dedicated reuse 
facilities in Veldhoven will be instrumental in this.   

Predictable external repair flow

We are working to increase the scalability and 
predictability of our reuse flows in order to future-proof 
return and recondition processes to deal with growing 
demand. This includes forecasting repairs to help 
suppliers prepare capacity. By combining service and 
factory return flows – and simplifying and automating 
operational planning and repair order management – we 
are increasing the availability of repaired parts. Our aim is 
to maximize reuse of parts and ensure it is the preferred 
option over new purchases.

Circular supplier collaboration

Packaging and transportation tools

We are collaborating with suppliers to incentivize reuse 
over new purchases. We are investigating transferring 
used parts back to our suppliers to repair, refurbish or 
harvest for reuse in their new buying process, giving 
them more flexibility in how they can reuse parts. 

In 2023, we investigated how to support a new 
collaboration model with suppliers for reusing materials 
and how to adjust our processes and systems to enable 
it. We piloted the new way of working with eight suppliers 
and have started engagements with additional suppliers.

Return quality

Challenges that occur downstream in the value chain 
during the repair phase often have their origins upstream 
and are related to the quality of returns, for example 
through incorrect labeling or packaging. 

In 2023, we started piloting barcode scanning of defect 
parts in the return flow to support correct labeling. In 
2024, this project will ramp up to a program to also 
cover all root causes of poor return quality. 

Valuable transportation materials – such as packaging, 
locking and plug materials – are used to safely transport 
our modules and systems, either from our suppliers to 
our factories or from our factories to our customers. 
Instead of being thrown away once they reach their 
destination, these materials are reused. 

Before parts are returned for reuse, they undergo an 
identification process and quality check, followed by the 
logistical and financial processes required to bring them 
back into the supply chain (either to the original module 
suppliers or to ASML). Our goal is to standardize these 
processes and create a network-related solution to 
enable high flexibility and reduce transport, which also 
reduces our CO2e footprint.

We are improving the reuse of packaging, lockings and 
plugs from the field and factory. We aim toward 100% 
recyclable packaging with an eye on minimizing waste 
and environmental impact.

In 2023, we made progress in reusing thousands of small 
auxiliary materials, such as plugs, flanges, caps and 
brackets. These are now being reused for system parts 
in our factories or for shipping machines to our 
customers. Furthermore, we developed a solution to 
embed the reuse requirements in our design processes – 
and this will be fully implemented in 2024.

Circular Innovation Program

The circular innovation program (CIP) is a 
collaboration with ImpactX and Brainport Industries. It 
is a four-day tailor-made program focusing on 
building a stronger relationship with our supply base 
by creating circular competencies.

In 2023, we consolidated CIP with the participation of 
eight suppliers divided into two cohorts. We run two 
cohorts per year and four suppliers are invited each 
time. Through the program we are able to close 
business loops, boost supplier impact and 
strengthen collaboration overall. The benefits are the 
creation of a shared vision on the circular economy, 
peer learning, and the joint building of competencies 
and knowledge around reusing products, parts and 
materials in the value chain. 

The participants invited so far are first-tier suppliers; 
however, we want to extend the program to other 
tiers as well. Additionally, we have the ambition to 
expand CIP beyond the Brainport Eindhoven region 
in the Netherlands, to other locations around the world.

Looking ahead

Reuse roadmap

In 2024, we will have more focus on the reuse program, 
with teams dedicated to repairs, reverse logistics, reuse- 
related engineering, local harvesting and repair centers 
worldwide.

In the context of supplier capacity, our supplier backlog 
is building up. We need stronger supplier collaboration, 
focusing on reuse over new, and working on forecasting 
and planning of repairs to reduce supplier repair cycle 
time.

We are implementing a structural improvement roadmap 
related to repair and reuse across all functions in ASML 
in order to meet our 2025 targets.

Recycle materials

How we’re managing 
our impact

ASML’s aim is to recycle material at end of life, focusing 
on the collection, analysis and reporting processes. We 
define the collection and sorting methods in collaboration 
with partners to increase recycling rates of both 
hazardous and non-hazardous materials, including local 
recycling at end of life and construction waste. We 
identify drivers of waste, gain insights into reasons for 
disposal, provide feedback to prevent waste, and 
improve designs and opportunities for recycling. 

Following our principles hierarchy, recycling materials is 
the final step in the process, in case we have not been 
able to prevent the waste, extend the lifetime of our 
systems and assets, or reuse our resources.

As our company grows, so too does the number of our 
employees, the number of systems we produce, and the 
number and size of our facilities. We are determined to 
decouple growth from our overall resource consumption. 

Recycling our waste plays a key role in closing the 
material loop – by 2030, we want to avoid energy 
recovery, incineration and landfill as much as possible. 
Our aim is to recycle materials instead of incinerating or 
disposing of them to landfill. Understanding our waste 
streams is key to identifying opportunities to increase 
recycling of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste.

We aim to maximize waste separation at our sites to 
enable increased recycling rates and easy recycling at 
the waste haulers'. 

Understanding and managing our waste flows and impacts

The effective monitoring and managing of waste relies on 
the availability of detailed and accurate insights into waste 
streams to and from ASML. We manage our waste 
through proper classification, separation, and safe disposal 
by waste vendors.  Our contracts with waste vendors 
state the need for compliance with local legislation and we 
aim to improve how this is monitored. 

Waste data is managed through our myEHS system, 
which collects information from our local waste 
vendors along with the relevant supporting 
documentation, such as invoices. The data entered is 
checked internally and by an independent party against 
the supporting documentation.

Circular economy (continued)
Recycle materials (continued)

Recycling materials conserves natural resources and 
reduces carbon emissions. In the Netherlands, after 
investigating non-product-related activities, some 
construction waste – such as concrete – has been 
reused (after processing) in the construction of new 
buildings.

Our targets and performance 
in 2023

Our waste intensity in 2023 was 300 kg per €m revenue, 
down from 315 kg per €m revenue in 2022. This remains 
below the pre-COVID-19 waste intensity. To achieve our 
target of 209 kg per €m revenue, we need to scale up 
our efforts to reduce our waste streams in absolute 
terms and improve our recycling rate.

We are increasing our efforts to reduce waste by setting 
up specific projects on packaging, general waste and 
hazardous materials. The main contributors to our 
packaging waste are wooden pallets. We need to extend 
their reuse even further and make a transition in waste 
treatment, from energy recovery to recycling. Another big 
challenge we are working on is to reduce packaging 
waste generated by the materials used to transport our 
systems and parts around the world. General waste from 
our offices and facilities represented 28% of the total waste 
in 2023. We have started projects on separation and sorting 
to improve its recyclability and prevent its generation.

Our aim is to avoid landfill and incineration by 2030. In 
2023, this accounted for 43% of our waste, including 
hazardous substances and construction waste. We are 
currently piloting an ASML solution which aims to reduce 
our hazardous waste by approximately 65%.

Our target is to achieve a recycling rate (excluding 
construction waste) of 90% by 2025. 

We saw a significant decrease in the recycling rate, from 
75% in 2022 to 55% in 2023. 

The lower recycling rate in 2023 can be explained by an 
increased focus on our waste. New insights show that 
waste companies reported recycling rates using different 
definitions. We will continue to improve the quality of data 
next year and start initiatives with our waste companies 
to increase the recycling rate.

Non-financial indicators - Circular economy

Our actions in 2023

Waste reduction program
During the year we launched a program to reduce waste 
coming from non-product-related resources. This 
program features several different initiatives, with the first 
focusing on creating clear governance processes to 
improve waste recycling, and working on obtaining more 
accurate and reliable data from our waste haulers. We 
also gained a better overview of our waste and mapped 
our waste streams at the Veldhoven site, which represent 
60% of our total waste. We created a circularity plan for 
our five largest industrial sites to improve our waste data 
quality and recycling rate. 

The full program, which covers plans for both 
hazardous and non-hazardous waste, includes:

• Identifying where the waste comes from (inbound 
versus operations) by organizing Gemba Walks 
(opportunities for staff to walk the work floor) to see 
the waste in the warehouse, factory and offices, and 
also by visiting our waste haulers to understand 
how our waste is processed

• Examining what the waste consists of through a 

detailed sorting test (performed by one of our waste 
haulers)

• Assessing the quantity of hazardous and non-

hazardous waste

• Identifying potentially large waste flows. The 

Veldhoven campus non-product-related waste 
flows are shown in the diagram on the next page

• Proposing actions and process optimizations to 

achieve our targets

Other recycling initiatives

In 2023, we started local remanufacturing of modules 
that capture tin from the EUV light source. As tin is a 
consumable, these ‘tin catch’ modules fill up and get 
contaminated by design. Local remanufacturing enables 
fast, efficient reuse with minimal shipment miles, as well 
as the possibility to reclaim tin for the next cycle of use. 

We actively support extending the life cycle of IT assets 
by giving them another life outside of ASML. In 2023, we 
donated over 300 laptops to multiple charities, mainly in 
the area of children's education. 

All IT assets that ASML can no longer use are 
professionally processed by a specialized partner after 
the end of their life cycle, with the aim of life cycle 
extension outside of ASML.

Improving waste stream management

d.

We have improved the accuracy of our waste reporting 
by increasing actual measurements of the amounts of 
waste at our main production site in Veldhoven. 

In addition, we have made progress across our wider 
portfolio, including:

1. Preparing to align our boundary reporting from 57 
locations to all locations worldwide – ready for 
implementation in 2024

2. Recognizing the need to manage recycling centrally, 
with implementation delegated to three groups with 
central governance 

3. Developing circularity master plans for infrastructure 
and facility-related activities at the largest ASML 
industrial sites – Veldhoven, San Diego, Wilton, 
Linkou and Tainan. The master plans cover three 
work streams with initiatives to: 1. Improve data 
quality, 2. Prevent, extend, reuse during construction 
and 3. Reduce waste/improve recycling in the short 
term

4.

Implementing a specific waste reduction program for 
non-product-related resources: 

a. Recognizing that waste is a challenge across the 

organization 

b. Focusing on our real estate, global manufacturing 
and IT department in the coming years to reduce 
waste 

c.

Initiating Gemba Walks in all of our largest sites to 
improve understanding of waste composition for 
future reduction initiatives, and to educate 
stakeholders on improving waste stream quality

Improving waste data integrity (including data 
completeness and relevance, among others). This 
is being rolled out firstly in our large factories and 
includes gap assessments, construction waste 
definitions, improved reporting and an overview of 
waste haulers 

e.

Implementing a program in the Netherlands to 
improve waste segregation upstream/
downstream, as part of our objective to increase 
waste recycling in the country to more than 90%

f. Engaging with a new waste hauler in Taiwan. We 
anticipate that this change should lead to a 46% 
improvement of our waste recycling in Tainan and 
18% in Linkou in 2024

g.

Implementing reuse of furniture in Taiwan 

h. Starting to audit waste management in our factory 

in Wilton (US)

i.

Improving scrutiny of accurate binning of waste 
categories in San Diego (US). This will provide 
better direction for future waste reduction 
initiatives 

j. Removing single-use plastic-containing food 

disposables (coffee cups/plastics in catering) in 
line with new laws in the Netherlands

Construction waste

As we continue to expand our facilities, we aim to 
maximize the recycling of waste from our construction 
activities. 

In 2023, we began to assess the completeness, 
accuracy and consistency of our construction waste 
reporting at four of our large industrial sites. 

Our conclusion is that we need to focus on two specific 
areas. Firstly, we must improve the data collection 
process around our construction waste streams. 
Secondly, we must improve data quality as part of our 
circularity roadmap. This is a significant challenge, 
because it means identifying construction waste over 
several hundred projects every year, some of which have 
already started, with multiple construction waste haulers. 
We currently have circularity master plans in place at our 
five biggest industrial sites and are working on improving 
the waste data.

Looking ahead

Despite our many initiatives, achieving our waste 
recycling targets remains a challenge.

Our actions in 2023 included the decision to reorganize 
how we manage our waste. In the months ahead, we 
intend to investigate the impact of this decision and 
prepare to implement an organizational structure that will 
be designed to help us achieve our recycling rate target. 
Based on the insights gained in 2023, we will re-evaluate 
the recycling rate target set for 2025. 

When implemented, the changes will impact how we 
categorize and manage our waste and will be designed 
to improve the integrity of waste data across the 
company. These enhancements will enable us to extend 
our waste reporting to all sites during 2024.

Our so-called piranha solution – used in etching 
processes to remove organic residues from substrates – 
represents about two-thirds of our hazardous waste. We 
will investigate specific solutions, such as the feasibility of 
reprocessing our piranha solution for reuse as sulfuric 
acid in a different market.

We will also investigate the feasibility of replacing single-
use disposable plastics for food and drinks in other large 
industrial sites with reusable alternatives, which we 
believe will lead to further reduction of our waste.

Finally, we will investigate scaling up our waste 
segregation – collection and sorting – onsite to improve 
the recycling rate.

Water management

Why it matters

Climate change and increased water demand combine 
to mean that droughts have become more extreme and 
unpredictable, and water is becoming a scarce resource 
in some locations. 

Water consumption at ASML accounts for only a tiny 
fraction of the water consumed by the semiconductor 
industry. Our water-related risk is therefore low 
compared to that of our customers, who use a significant 
amount of water during the semiconductor 
manufacturing processes.

How we’re managing 
our impact

Despite our relatively low level of water usage, as a 
responsible business we promote efficient water use and 
recycling across our sites and processes.

Read more in our TCFD Recommendations – Climate-related 
disclosure, available at asml.com 

In our factories, we use water in three key ways: Firstly, 
we use it to remove heat loads and maintain the systems 
at a constant temperature. Internal cooling circuits are all 
designed as ‘closed-loop’ (recycling) systems to limit 
water consumption. Secondly, these heat loads are 
eventually removed in cooling towers using evaporation 
of lower-quality water. Finally, DUV systems use ultrapure 
water in the immersion hood – this water is currently only 
partially recycled.

Our water consumption in 2023 remained stable around 
1% higher at 1,173,990 m3, if compared to 1,161,850 
m3 in 2022.

Friends from outside ASML sometimes ask 
me about working in technology as a woman 
or working in the US as a Russian. Those 
questions surprise me, as who I am has 
never been a factor in my experience and the 
opportunities I have had at ASML. 

Yes, the industry has been male dominated, 
but it is changing. When I started eight years 
ago, I used to joke that I was given my own 
private bathroom, as I was the only woman 
on my floor. But that certainly isn’t true 
anymore. And in my experience, ideas are 
always judged on their merit.

There are programs to support different 
groups within ASML. They do great things 
bringing people together and raising issues, 
but people here really don’t need much 
education.

Source of inspiration

I joined ASML because I was blown away by 
the technology as a student. And I still am. I 
recently moved on to a new stage in my journey 
here, managing the entire NXE:3800 source 
that will be introduced to customers in 2024. 
But even now, I sometimes go down to the lab 
just to look at a source prototype with its 
thousands of components. That we can make 
that work seems almost like magic, even after 
eight years of working for ASML.

ASML’s senior management needed an 
update, and fast. As the subject matter 
expert was absent and I was onsite, I was 
asked to give a presentation the next day. I 
had no prior knowledge of the issue, but 
spent the night learning everything I could. I 
read all the materials and phoned round 
colleagues for more information. Everyone 
was happy to help. The presentation went so 
well that I was asked to head up a task force 
to address the issue. A year later, the project 
won awards from key customers and within 
ASML, and mirror lifetime had gone from the 
number one customer issue to something 
people hardly ever mentioned.

A culture of support

That unexpected opportunity was the first 
real step on my project management journey. 
And it highlights two of my favorite things 
about working at ASML: The technology and 
the culture. I couldn’t have given that 
presentation without the support of the 
colleagues who took my calls and answered 
my questions. The supportive culture is why I 
feel confident to take on new challenges 
here: There are always people around who 
want to help you and ASML succeed.

Finding a place to grow

A new journey

I started small, leading a team of one – me. 
But I loved the energy and was eager for 
more. The next opportunity came out of the 
blue. I was on a trip to Veldhoven when key 
customers reported an issue that was 
impacting the lifetime of mirrors used in our 
EUV light sources. This had become our 
number one customer issue and could have 
delayed the introduction of EUV lithography 
into mass production.

I had wanted to work at ASML ever since I 
was a graduate student, and a course mate 
told me about the company. I read more 
online and watched all the YouTube videos I 
could find. I was blown away by the cutting-
edge technology. 

Soon after graduating, I was lucky enough to 
get a temporary contract and then a 
permanent position as an engineer in the 
Source Performance team in San Diego, 
working to improve the performance of EUV 
light sources. A fantastic manager suggested 
that I may have a talent for project 
management. I am someone who thrives on 
a fast pace, pressure and action, so I said 
why not?

Energy efficiency and climate action We are working to reduce our carbon footprint to achieve net zero emissions across our value chain by 2040.

As the world turns to technology to help solve its pressing challenges, our goal is to expand the availability of computing power and data storage capability while reducing the environmental footprint of our operations, our supply chain, and from the use of our products and services.

The growing demand for enhanced chip functionality means that the complexity and energy consumption of the overall microchip patterning process is increasing.

Aiming for net zero emissions across our entire value chain by 2040 while energy demand is increasing is a complex challenge that can only be achieved by working closely with our partners, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders.

Our ambition is to achieve carbon neutrality with net zero emissions across our manufacturing and buildings (scope 1 and 2) by 2025.

With regard to scope 3, we aim to achieve net zero emissions from business travel and commuting (travel to and from work) by 2025, in our supply chain (scope 3 upstream) by 2030, and from the use of our products and services by customers (scope 3 downstream) by 2040.

Our goal is to reduce our climate impacts, working closely together with our peers in the entire semiconductor value chain in our own operations together with our suppliers, in our customers’ production process and through reducing the energy used by semiconductors in operation by enabling scaling.

Increasing energy efficiency is one of the key levers our efforts range from optimizing the technical installations in our buildings to supplying more energy efficient products (in terms of energy spent per wafer exposure) to customers.

Other ways we are working to reduce our GHG emissions include reducing business travel, commuting more sustainably, using renewable electricity and minimizing our use of natural gas by reusing waste heat and electrification.

Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions Scope 3 CO2e emissions Scope 3 CO2e emissions intensity (per m gross profit).

Scope 3 CO2e emissions intensity (per m revenue) NXE energy use per exposed wafer.

We have implemented an environmental management system (EMS) to monitor energy use and emissions and improve performance and enhance efficiency across our global operations.

The EMS is integrated into the overall environmental, health and safety (EHS) management system operated by all ASML facilities.

This system was recertified for ISO 14001 (the standard for environmental management systems) in 2023 and structured in accordance with ISO 45001 (the standard for occupational health and safety management systems) requirements.

We have set a target to achieve net zero emissions in our value chain by 2040.

We will need to work closely with our customers, suppliers and partners to achieve the milestones in our journey to net zero emissions in our value chain.

As part of our journey to net zero emissions, we are a signatory to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and we currently have two SBTi approved near term targets.

Reduction of 25.2% of our combined scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2025, compared to base year 2019, without offsetting.

Reduction of 35.3% in scope 3 intensity (emissions per unit of gross profit) in 2025 compared to 2019, without offsetting.

We use natural gas resulting in direct emissions (scope 1).

In some parts of the world, we have been unable as of yet to buy green electricity.

This results in local emissions caused by fossil power plants (scope 2).

Emissions from employees traveling to our customers, suppliers and other parts of ASML, and from employees traveling to and from work.

A significant portion of our GHG emissions are generated indirectly in our supply chain, as we mainly assemble modules that we source from suppliers.

Parts and modules have to be transported to us or our customers directly, and our assembled systems are shipped from ASML premises to customers.

As today’s freight logistics, especially air transportation, are still carbon intensive, a significant part of our supply chain emissions stem from logistics (operated by our logistics suppliers).

Our customers are not always able to use 100% renewable electricity to run their business.

We identify and assess the impact of climate related risks and opportunities using the assessment guidelines of the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

Alongside our efforts to lower our carbon footprint, we are committed to using our innovations and digital technologies to enable the wider semiconductor industry to reduce its overall environmental footprint.

Our participation in the annual Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) assessment helps steer our environmental initiatives.

CDP runs the global disclosure system that drives actions and transparency for environment impacts.

Our score in the most recent CDP Climate Change 2023 questionnaire was B, with C being the global average.

We continuously aim to improve and execute emissions reduction plans throughout the value chain to achieve our net zero commitment, aiming to maintain good progress in fighting climate change and to be recognized by the CDP in the A list.

While we measure and aim to reduce the impacts of our operations, supply chain and product use, ASML’s climate impacts extend far beyond these areas to include the benefits and risks that our technology brings to society.

The technology pioneered by our R D teams and partners sits at the heart of global digitalization and has the potential to transform how we all live and work.

We enable our customers to innovate the semiconductor technologies that can help humanity manage its challenges and seize opportunities by facilitating sustainable living and mobility, accessible healthcare, food security and the transition to renewable energy.

For example, semiconductors are harnessing, converting, transferring and storing energy from sources such as solar and wind power as electricity and helping to ensure that national power grids are both responsive and robust.

Mitigating climate change means reducing energy demand by developing end use applications that are as energy efficient as possible.

Digital technology can help businesses and citizens cut energy consumption and save money.

Smart sensors can detect room occupancy, allowing lights and heating to be switched off and on automatically.

Smartphone applications make it possible for people to remotely control their appliances or get from A to B through car sharing, ride sharing or other demand driven, flexible ways of transportation.

And as we transition away from fossil fuels, electric vehicles will become the norm and will require new, potentially diverse electronic solutions.

On the adverse side, we acknowledge the effects of digital technologies that increase energy demand, such as AI, IoT, blockchain and cryptocurrency mining.

The guidance from the GHG Protocol the organization that provides widely used international standards for emissions reporting is used for the calculation of the emission scope.

Market based conversion factors are used to calculate the scope 2 CO2e emissions in kt.

We report the market based emissions after purchase of renewable electricity the electricity is proven emission free by tracking energy attribute certificates.

ASML currently does not compensate any emissions, resulting in no differences between our gross and net emissions.

The 2023 figure includes nine months of actual data and three months of estimates.

The 2022 figure has been adjusted with data for the entire year (11,900 kt best estimate in the 2022 Annual Report).

The 2021 figure has been adjusted to report the exact figure instead of a rounded figure.

Since 2023, when we measure the energy efficiency of our DUV immersion and DUV dry systems, the laser is included within the measurement.

In 2021, we started a new master plan period for 2021 2025, with a target to achieve 100 TJ energy savings by the end of 2025.

The savings reported are cumulated compared with the base year therefore, they are not comparable between years.

The baseline figure of the NXE:3400B energy use per exposed wafer pass has been corrected, from 13.08 kWh to 12.8 kWh, due to an incorrect rounding being used in the past.

As we work toward net zero emissions in our value chain, our most immediate task is to manage the climate impacts of our own operations and buildings.

Scope 1 emissions comprise direct CO2 emissions from use of fossil fuels mainly natural gas in our operations.

The majority of natural gas consumption is used for heating our buildings and for humidification of our cleanrooms.

Scope 2 emissions arise from our purchased electricity, which accounts for 80% of the energy we use at ASML. Most of our electricity consumption relates to the manufacturing of chipmaking equipment assembly and testing of lithography, metrology and inspection systems and maintaining consistent climate conditions such as temperature, humidity and air quality.

Our target is to achieve net zero scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025.

This target exceeds the reductions needed to limit global warming to 1.5 C. We report market based emissions after purchase of renewable electricity the electricity is proven emission free by tracking energy attribute certificates (EACs).

Despite an increase in our electricity and gas consumption due to company growth of 30.2%, the share of renewable electricity remained comparable to 2022 at around 91.4%.

For the third year in a row, our net scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions have decreased from 39.4 kt in 2021 and 38.1 kt in 2022 to 35.1 kt in 2023.

This decrease in 2023 was due to a combination of business growth (2 kt) and adding process CO2 emissions (1 kt) to scope 1 reporting, consistent with reporting guidelines, compensated by a 4.9 kt reduction in Taiwan following a change in contract in 2022 to reduce our CO2 (reduction of CO2 emission scope 2), and a 1.1 kt reduction due to our energy savings master plan.

Our energy saving master plan covers each of our five largest industrial sites and includes over 80 projects.

It aims to reduce energy consumption through direct annual savings of at least 100 TJ (or 5 kt CO2e).

The main components of the master plan are improving the efficiency of our technical installations used for our operation, and optimizing our portfolio by building new offices that meet the latest green building standards, such as BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) in Europe, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) in the US or G SEED (Green Standard for Energy and Environmental Design) in South Korea.

We are also investing in renewable energy production at our sites.

Reducing our use of natural gas is a key objective.

We have a multi year project to implement an energy grid to reuse waste heat from our factories and offices on our site in Veldhoven.

The energy grid is a two pipe loop that makes waste heat available for heating in winter and energy efficient cooling in summer.

Based on our plans, we estimate that the use of natural gas in Veldhoven will be reduced from around 4.9 million m3 to around 1.2 million m3 in the next three to four years, driven by the energy grid and other energy saving measures.

As we grow as a company, we strive to optimize our real estate portfolio because our buildings account for a significant percentage of our scope 1 and 2 emissions.

When building new offices and manufacturing sites, we seize the opportunity to make them sustainable, and several of our existing buildings have been assessed for performance against BREEAM guidelines.

Two additional buildings in the Netherlands achieved a BREEAM 'Excellent' rating in 2023: our logistic center and one large office building.

Five more buildings are in the process of achieving a BREEAM 'Excellent' rating in 2024.

With an eye on future growth, our new campus in Veldhoven is being designed with a strong focus on sustainability.

We are applying the latest building sustainability standards to our real estate worldwide, wherever possible.

In 2023, as part of our energy savings master plan, we executed key projects in the Netherlands, the US and Taiwan which resulted in around 16 TJ annual energy savings.

The total energy savings delivered by projects executed between 2021 and 2023 amounted to 47 TJ.

In 2023, if we include part of the savings realized by projects started in 2022 and not accounted for in 2022, we realized savings of: 11 TJ per year through operationalizing systems of the energy grid and implementing H2 venting in two manufacturing buildings in Veldhoven.

The remaining 31 TJ is from savings realized by projects executed in 2021 and 2022.

We are driving a shift to renewable energy by increasing the share of direct green energy purchases (so called bundled renewable electricity) from renewable electricity generated close to our premises.

In the Netherlands, we are in the third year of a 10 year purchase agreement for green electricity for our installations.

This enables us to achieve our goal of using 100% renewable electricity in the country.

In 2023, 100% of the electricity used in our US and Chinese facilities was also from renewable sources.

In 2023, we managed to secure a long term power purchase agreement (PPA) in Taiwan.

The contract will be operational in 2024 and help us with our aim to reduce our emissions, with 16 kt on a yearly basis as of 2025.

We continue to face challenges in South Korea, where there is little to no credible renewable electricity.

Compensating for CO2 emissions We aim to reduce energy consumption and use renewable energy as much as possible.

Where this is not feasible, we intend to purchase voluntary emission reduction certificates (VERs) no later than 2025.

Established in November 2022 with ASML as a founding member, the Semiconductor Climate Consortium aims to address the challenges of climate change and speed up the industry’s efforts to reduce GHG emissions throughout the value chain.

Founding members have affirmed their support of the Paris Agreement and related accords driving the 1.5 C pathway.

Ambition Set near and long term decarbonization targets with the aim of reaching net zero emissions by 2040 Collaboration Align on common approaches, technology innovations and communication channels to continuously reduce GHG emissions by reducing the carbon footprint stemming from electricity usage for semiconductor manufacturing and for powering chips in electronics devices.

On September 20, 2023, the SCC published its first report providing an in depth analysis of the semiconductor value chain’s carbon footprint and priority ranked carbon emission sources for the industry to address.

Our energy savings master plan will continue to provide savings in 2024 2025.

In 2024, we expect an acceleration of the energy saving projects in the five year energy master plan.

These include installation of solar panels in San Diego that are expected to lead to 8 TJ per year savings in 2024, while the operationalization of the energy grid and renovation of buildings in the Netherlands are expected to lead to an additional 25 TJ per year at the end of 2024.

We believe that this will enable us to achieve our target of 100 TJ (or 5 kt CO2e) per year by 2025.

We have signed a five year Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (CPPA) in Taiwan with the aim of providing our operations there with about 70% renewable electricity in 2024.

Since we do not use gas in Taiwan, our ambition is to reach 100% renewable by the end of 2025.

While the renewable electricity market in South Korea is limited, we will continue to look for alternative solutions to procure renewable energy in South Korea and will use offsetting in case we are not able to reach our net zero target.

In the coming years, we plan to expand the use of solar panels on our sites in EMEA, the US and Asia.

We aim to have more than 20,000 solar panels on our roofs by 2025.

This would give us a total energy saving of around 40 TJ per year and a total CO2 emission reduction of around 5 kt per year.

This is equivalent to the energy use of (on average) 3,900 households per year, taking 2,100 cars off the road or planting around 250,000 new trees (around six trees for every ASML employee).

Lastly, we are working on a plan for compensating our emissions to reach net zero scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025.

We will also work toward reporting on the environmental footprint of our approximately 160 buildings globally, which include ASML owned buildings such as manufacturing buildings, offices and a few warehouses and buildings leased by ASML.

In 2023, we identified our impact on the environment through emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx), non methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and hydrogen (H2) from manufacturing as a new material topic.

We are developing a process to formally manage and report this topic starting in 2024.

Scope 3 emissions include both upstream and downstream activities and comprise the emissions that are generated in our supply chain, through business travel and commuting, and through use of our products at our customers.

We measure progress in reducing our scope 3 emissions by emission intensity, i.e.

Our overall target for 2025 is to reduce the intensity of scope 3 emissions to 1,016 tonnes CO2e per million gross profit, in line with our SBTi commitment.

This represents a 35.3% intensity reduction compared with 2019.

Our scope 3 intensity for 2023 was 1,060 tonnes CO2e per million gross profit (2022: 1,116 tonnes).

Our results indicate that the scope 3 emissions account for 15.0 Mt, or 99.8%, of our total emissions footprint (scope 1, 2 and 3).

Of this, 5.5 Mt are upstream’ emissions (mainly related to the goods and services we buy and ship), 0.1 Mt are from business travel and commuting, and 9.4 Mt are indirect downstream’ emissions (use of sold products at our customers’ sites).

As of 2023, we report indirect climate change effects of air travel (radiative forcing, non CO2 emissions) separately and not as part of our scope 3 emissions.

This is to align with current reporting practices of airlines and in line with recommendations from SBTi.

This has resulted in comparative figures being updated.

Our overall emissions are increasing due to the growth of ASML.

We expect emissions to continue rising in the short term due to our continued growth and more complex products.

To ensure that we meet our ambition for net zero emissions by 2040, we need to work closely with our value chain partners, for example on increasing the capacity of renewable electricity in some regions of the world.

We are still on track to achieve our SBTi target of 1,016 tonnes CO2e per million gross profit in 2025.

On the following pages you can read more about how we're tackling scope 3 emissions specifically related to business travel and commuting, our supply chain, and through the use of our products by customers.

Our overall target for 2025 is to reduce the intensity of scope 3 emissions to 1,016 tonnes CO2e per million gross profit, in line with our SBTi commitment.

Looking ahead For 2024, we aim to strengthen our partnership with KLM to further reduce our emissions from aviation so that we will be able to meet ASML's ambition of net zero CO2 emissions in 2025 for business travel.

The year will also see us commence a project that will better quantify emissions from employee commuting in our operating regions outside the Netherlands.

This is likely to lead to targeted interventions to further reduce the commuting emissions in later years.

Where there are no alternatives, we aim to offset our residual emissions from employee commuting and business travel by purchasing VERs in the coming years.

Business travel: Reducing the volume of business travel through stricter policies, raising awareness and use of remote working and servicing options.

Commuting: To reduce the percentage of car commutes in our Veldhoven region (NL), we focus on developing a mix of sustainable commuting options by encouraging people to travel to work by bicycle or public transport.

Alongside this, we provide shuttle bus services from Park Ride locations, offer satellite offices and promote a balanced working from home policy.

Our target is to achieve net zero emissions from business travel and commuting by 2025.

In 2023, taking into account Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) purchases, our total emissions due to business travel and commuting were 70 kt CO2e and 54 kt CO2e, respectively (see graphs).

Due to the increasing number of employees at all locations and the ending of COVID 19 travel restrictions, our emissions increased by 13% compared to 2022 (69 kt CO2e and 41 kt CO2e, respectively).

Commuting emissions are predominantly related to commuting by car.

The impact of the indirect climate change effects of air travel are excluded from our business travel emissions, as explained on the previous page.

For business travel, we created and launched a travel dashboard for managers to provide clear insights into travel cost, broken down into the underlying elements such as hotel and air travel.

This dashboard aims to drive behavioral change, as it also shows the related CO2 emissions.

We reduced our global travel budget per FTE by 30% from pre COVID 19 travel patterns of 2019.

We stimulated green travel modes by encouraging employees to use train travel for specific destinations, such as Berlin and London.

We have launched a project aiming to use SAF for air travel.

In 2023, ASML purchased 4,341 tonnes of SAF, which has avoided 10,198 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

From January 2024, we aim to use only electric vehicles in our rental car program in Veldhoven.

In 2023, we also joined 'Anders Reizen', a coalition of more than 70 organizations in the Netherlands which aims to reduce CO2 emissions related to business travel and commuting of its members by 50% in 2030 compared to 2016.

To enable employees in the Netherlands to commute for free between their home and work on public transport, we provided them with a business card of the Dutch railways ('Nederlandse Spoorwegen').

In addition, exclusive shuttle bus services have been set up between Eindhoven central station and the Veldhoven campus, and shared e bikes are available as a successful, sustainable solution.

Reducing emissions arising from upstream activities in our supply chain for example, by sharing data and targets requires close collaboration with our suppliers and other upstream stakeholders.

ESG sustainability has become a major theme in our supplier relationships.

Our Sourcing Procurement (S P) ESG sustainability program is a key enabler in our efforts to reduce scope 3 emissions by actively engaging and collaborating with suppliers, to drive further progress.

We depend on our suppliers and other upstream value chain partners to work with us to jointly reduce our carbon footprint.

In 2023, total emissions due to upstream activities (excluding business travel and commuting) were 5,458 kt CO2e, an increase of 14% from 2022 in line with our increase in sales (since we use the spend based approach for calculating emissions).

Purchased goods and services and capital goods contribute to 82% of these emissions.

Most of the remaining emissions are from transportation and distribution.

One of our future key focuses will be building on the supplier GHG emissions baseline and we will be working with our top 100 suppliers toward commitment on net zero scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2030.

We will also be encouraging suppliers to develop roadmaps for improving energy efficiency in their production processes, using renewable energy and (as a last resort) offsetting.

We expect that new EU regulations and other directives around mandatory disclosure of scope 3 emissions data will help to increase transparency across our supply chain, and will result in firm actions to reduce scope 3 upstream emissions.

To support the optimization of the design, in the D E ESG sustainability program we will work toward improving the data, automating the GHG emissions calculations and providing consistent data on the design connected to a product roadmap.

This will include actual supplier data where available.

Also, we will aim to have a first CO2e footprint estimate available based on the design information of an ASML product.

We constantly seek to improve data quality by working with our suppliers for example, while the spend based methodology is useful, it fails to reflect improvements that reduce GHG emissions.

In previous years, we have seen a mix of supplier maturity levels in reporting scope 1 and 2 emissions data.

We obtain GHG emissions data (scope 1, 2 and limited scope 3) from our suppliers.

Our aim is to use this information to compare spend based emissions data with actual emissions data, to help drive meaningful progress.

We learned that spend based emissions are overestimated compared to actual emissions data.

As a result, our next step to improve data quality is to include actual supplier emissions data in our calculations for scope 3.

It will take time before we can reliably assess all our suppliers’ scope 3 emissions data, as not all of them have visibility of their own supply chain emissions.

To support them, we have introduced an IT dashboard that will capture and display the relevant data.

In 2023, we made progress by requesting CO2e emissions data directly from our suppliers through our S P ESG sustainability program.

We aim to use this data as part of our move from spend based to hybrid based data.

In 2023 we also improved our knowledge within Development and Engineering (D E) in estimating CO2e emissions from our suppliers by building competence on life cycle analysis.

We are investigating how to determine the impact of the design and have started developing tooling for our engineers.

With this, we aim at raising awareness, finding hotspots in the design and making a start with steering for design changes.

We calculate our scope 3 emissions using guidance from the GHG Protocol the organization that provides widely used international standards for emissions reporting.

We currently use the spend based methodology for calculating supplier emissions.

As demand for enhanced chip functionality grows, the complexity and energy consumption of the overall microchip patterning process including that of our lithography and metrology and inspection systems is increasing.

To measure CO2e emissions from product use, we calculate emissions generated by our customers’ electricity usage while operating ASML machines.

In line with the GHG Protocol, we calculate these emissions based on the number of newly installed machines at our customers’ sites during the reporting year multiplied by the lifetime of the machine (estimated at 20 years).

When we design new systems, we increasingly focus on reducing energy consumption and cost, while increasing performance and availability.

The EUV light source is the key focus of our current engineering efforts, because it accounts for the largest portion of an EUV system’s total energy consumption.

In addition, we have started to better assess the energy efficiency of our other product families in DUV, metrology and inspection, computational lithography, and scanner and process control software solutions.

We’re working with peers and partners including through the SCC (read more in our case study on page 81) to accelerate efforts to reduce GHG emissions, share knowledge and technology and stimulate the adoption of renewable energy worldwide.

Semiconductor manufacturing processes are designed to maximize the utilization of the critical lithography systems.

However, there will be times when a system is not in use.

Up to now, the lithography system has remained fully powered on to ensure the system is perfectly conditioned at all times to deliver nanometer accurate performance.

In order to reduce energy consumption of our systems, we have introduced a sleep mode, which allows for powering down of subsystems to conserve energy.

This does affect thermal conditioning of the system, which requires a few minutes of reconditioning to get the system fully production ready again.

The key here is to give our customers control over a system's state.

The customer has insight into when these idle periods occur, which enables them to put the lithography system into sleep mode without impacting wafer output.

Triggered by a command from the fab automation system, the lithography system temporarily powers down some subsystems and then, again triggered by fab automation, returns them back to production mode in time for the next lot.

Most of the energy of an EUV lithography system is used by the CO2 drive laser, so this is a prime candidate for introducing our sleep mode solution.

In the drive laser, CO2 gas is compressed and subsequently exited (via nitrogen) by radio frequency (RF) generators.

A seed laser is used to trigger stimulated emission of infrared light, which is subsequently used to generate EUV light.

We will soon introduce sleep mode for the RF generators.

We have developed a software interface that allows our customers to send sleep and wake up commands to the system, which power down the RF generators via internal control software.

This RF sleep mode has been tested in house, confirming the energy saving potential as well as fully meeting system specifications immediately after the reconditioning sequence.

RF sleep mode has the potential to reduce EUV system energy consumption by approximately 2.5%, averaged over time, when utilized in high volume manufacturing at our customers' sites.

The sleep mode interface will also act as a foundation for implementing sleep mode in other sub modules, further increasing the energy saving potential.

Our target is to reduce the overall energy consumption of our future generation EUV systems by 10% compared with the 2018 baseline model (NXE:3400B) by 2025, while increasing productivity.

We have also set a 2025 target to reduce the energy consumption per exposed wafer by 60%, compared with the 2018 baseline (NXE:3400B).

Reaching our targets has our full attention, and we plan to measure our NXE:3800E in 2024, which we expect will bring us closer to achieving our 2025 target.

Based on the latest measurement of the NXE:3600D, energy use per exposed wafer pass was 7.7 kWh (versus our NXE platform 2025 target of 5.1 kWh) which shows an improvement from the last measurement taken in 2021 of 8.3 kWh.

Based on the latest measurement of the NXT:1980Fi, energy use per exposed wafer pass was 0.52 kWh.

In 2023, total emissions from the use of sold products were 9,443 kt CO2e, of which EUV accounted for 5,757 kt CO2e, DUV for 3,488 kt CO2e and metrology and inspection systems for 198 kt CO2e.

The emissions have increased in line with an increase in sales.

The table below provides an overview of our systems' energy use, acceptance test protocol (ATP) throughput and energy efficiency.

System type 2015 Year of energy measurement 1.2 Energy consumption (in MW) 59 ATP throughput (in wph) Energy use per wafer pass (in kWh)2 19.5 1.

The baseline figure of the NXE:3400B energy use per exposed wafer pass has been corrected, from 13.08 kWh to 12.8 kWh, due to an incorrect rounding being used in the past.

We also worked on improving the data quality of our inventory for scope 3 downstream emissions.

This year we included the use of HMI e beam inspection systems in our inventory.

We also included the laser contribution into our reported values for DUV systems, as well as the process CO2 gas, which is released during operation of some of our immersion scanners.

Operation and idle time were updated to better represent actual usage, based on customer data.

In 2024, we will continue to work on the energy efficiency of our systems and other product families.

At the moment, we see no reason to adjust our 2025 targets regarding the energy consumption of our systems.

In 2023, we continued working on energy efficiency improvements for future products, which require long lead times and take multiple years to achieve.

Progress on these projects is monitored on a quarterly basis.

We proved the capability of the NXE:3600D system to reach productivity targeting 175 wph (as compared with the current specification of 160 wph).

In 2024, this will be introduced to the market as the NXE:3600 PEP D package.

For our DUV systems, we identified possible energy saving options, among others around wafer stage and reticle stage magnet innovations, adaptive cooling water flows, reducing the power consumption when systems are idle (similar to the sleep mode in EUV) and reusing the otherwise directly emitted CO2 from the immersion hood in our immersion scanners.

For our metrology and inspection systems, we also identified possible energy saving options, among others around exhaust management and cooling and creating a sleep mode to reduce power consumption when systems are idle.

Sustainability is a design challenge that must be solved in parallel with system cost and performance that’s how we will make the biggest difference.

A sustainability mindset Ton van der Net specializes in improving the energy efficiency and overall sustainability of lithography systems.

He has been at the forefront of ASML’s sustainability efforts as they have grown from a team led initiative to a corporate level commitment that is becoming integral to how we develop our systems.

Many of that initial team including myself are still active in driving a sustainable innovation culture within ASML.

We are looking to embed sustainability even more fully into ASML’s PGP, because you get better results faster and at lower cost if you build sustainability in from the start.

To this end, our system design specifications the handbook for what we want to achieve in a new system now include maximum power consumption and a power breakdown as standard.

By making sustainability part of our standard processes, we have switched on the innovation power of 20,000 ASML engineers.

We are also looking at the materials we use to build our systems.

There are standard ways of estimating the sustainability of materials in terms of their energy cost to produce and recyclability, but they are very approximate.

We want to develop more accurate methods based on actual materials and processes.

The sustainability of materials could then become another driver for innovation.

Sustainable innovation is becoming part of our business as usual, just another design specification for our engineers alongside performance, cost and time to delivery.

Because, in the end, all those factors must be balanced.

Our sustainability efforts only have value if they come in a system that meets our customers’ business needs.

This is quite a radical change in mindset for any company.

However, publications from the likes of McKinsey have shown that companies who perform well in sustainability typically outperform their competitors in market share and brand image.

What’s more, around this time, ASML announced a corporate commitment aiming to have net zero emissions in our value chain by 2040.

And the largest contribution to our current carbon footprint is the energy our systems use at customers.

Between 2018 and 2023, we reduced the energy per wafer for EUV lithography by almost 40%.

And we have a roadmap for another 20% of reductions by 2025.

Sustainability is now becoming a business driver at ASML, due partly to the corporate commitment and partly to the internal motivation of individuals.

Our Green ASML employee network has over 2,000 people looking at everything from the food we serve in the cafeteria to system energy consumption.

We’ve even had internal Shark Tank’ style events to generate new ideas to make our whole operation more sustainable.

About seven years ago, in response to customers’ concerns, we started looking at the scale of the infrastructure, like cooling and power, needed to run lithography systems.

These support facilities needed as much space as the production lines.

When we estimated the total power they required, it was huge around 1.3 MW for our EUV systems (as much as a few thousand Dutch homes) and projected to grow further.

Continuing that trajectory wasn’t environmentally responsible.

So, a small team of ASML engineers including me started exploring ways to reduce energy consumption in lithography.

For example, a lot of that 1.3 MW went into cooling the system and handling the hydrogen flow used to prevent contamination build up.

Our initial list of ideas inspired ASML’s first KPI for sustainable system development.

Some of these ideas looked at how the systems were used, while others required changes to the system.

For example, if we redesigned the cooling features, customers could use warmer cooling water reducing the need for power hungry chillers.

So, we teamed up with system engineering to engage the people who make the day to day design decisions.

These early discussions triggered us to build a business case for our ideas.

That meant thinking and encouraging others to think about the value of our changes beyond purely financial terms.

Circular economy We aim to maximize the value of our systems, reusing resources as much as possible, while minimizing waste, decoupling our growth from resource consumption, and recycling materials.

Our materiality assessment identified the impact of our use of materials and resources as a material topic and our focus on a circular economy is the cornerstone of our commitment to managing this challenge.

A circular economy enables sustainable economic growth by creating business loops, ensuring efficient use of resources and driving an innovative business model.

This approach is an essential part of decoupling our growth from the increasing consumption of resources.

Through our circular economy initiative, we aim to ensure our products and services retain and create as much value as possible for us and our partners in the ecosystem.

How we’re managing our impact A successful transition toward a circular economy means improved designs, operational resilience, reduced emissions and reduced costs.

Improved designs are achieved through learning from use cases both successes and failures to improve products, solutions and processes.

The availability of parts and access to material to support ASML’s growth, while decoupling it from material consumption and closing the loops, will be key for operational resilience.

This will lead to reduced emissions through disposing locally and eliminating waste ending in incineration, energy recovery and landfill.

Cost reduction can be achieved by optimizing the amount of purchased goods while avoiding surplus and reusing resources to eliminate waste.

In summary, ASML’s approach to circular economy is designing products for longevity and reuse, creating closed loop supply chains and encouraging the recycling of materials.

The diagram on the right illustrates our circular economy approach.

By 2030, we aim to send zero waste from operations to landfill or incineration1.

Prevent waste from our assets, systems and processes by redesigning them, in collaboration with our suppliers and customers, to limit their environmental impact.

Extend the lifetime and productivity of our systems and assets to maximize their usage throughout their life cycles.

Reuse resources, parts, tools, packaging and goods across the value chain.

Recycle materials if we can no longer apply any of the previous principles, avoiding incineration and landfill.

Incineration is defined to include processes with and without energy recovery.

We measure our impact in tonnes of waste, by category (hazardous and non hazardous) and by material type (such as plastics, paper, wood and hazardous liquids).

We include data on the CO2e impact of processing our waste in our scope 3 emissions.

Non hazardous waste, such as packaging material, product related waste from parts resulting from upgrades or defects, and general waste.

This category also includes construction waste from building activities the amount of construction waste tends to fluctuate over the years.

Hazardous waste, such as the chemicals we use in our manufacturing processes.

This can include everything from lamps, batteries and liquids to cleaning wipes and filters.

Most of our hazardous waste is in the form of liquids, including acetone and piranha acid.

This reporting indicator follows the principle of prior year indicator Value of scrapped parts (in millions)' however it does not include packaging.

Construction waste is excluded from the calculation of this indicator.

The amount of construction waste tends to fluctuate over the years and can therefore make the trend of the indicator unclear.

In 2023, we generated 8,932 tonnes of waste from our operations overall (including construction waste).

This was an increase of 29% over 2022 (6,913 tonnes).

In 2023, 43% of the total waste from operations (including construction waste) was sent to landfill, incineration with energy recovery or incineration (2022: 25%).

The presence of hazardous materials is a risk to our ability to achieve our goal of sending zero waste from operations to landfill or incineration.

In some countries, there is also the risk that our waste hauler may not be able to identify companies able to recycle some of our waste.

Our total amount of waste increased due to ASML’s growth, despite the impact of projects to reduce waste.

However, the amount of waste from operations normalized to revenue showed a decrease in 2023.

During the year, 7% of total waste (653 tonnes) was related to construction (2022: 238 tonnes, or 3%).

The amount of construction waste increased compared to 2022.

During 2023, significant demolition activities were ongoing on our Veldhoven main campus.

Since we hand over the responsibility of the construction sites to the building contractor, the demolition waste is excluded from our waste data.

Although we do not report on it, we work with our contractors to try to ensure maximum recycling of this waste.

The first principle of our circular economy is to prevent waste.

This involves eliminating or limiting waste at its source by rethinking and redesigning processes to avoid waste, focusing on design, sourcing and quality, among others.

We aim to design our systems, products and processes to maximize their value by focusing on commonality, modularity, compatibility, standardization, reusability, reliability and recyclability, while opting for mono material components and eco design methodology, minimizing the use of critical raw materials like rare earths and hazardous materials.

We aim to collaborate with product and non product related suppliers that deliver durable and efficient products with recycled material, which can be upgraded, refurbished, repaired, reused and recycled.

We improve the quality of our systems by avoiding defects on arrival, and implementing lean principles in all processes, specifically in manufacturing and logistics, to eliminate waste.

We design our systems to last for as long as possible in order to prevent waste.

Built in feedback loops ensure that we continuously improve product designs by learning from failure modes and repair activities.

We have a team dedicated to ensuring we take a sustainable packaging approach that maximizes the use of our resources and minimizes waste while ensuring the safe transport of our systems.

We also have activities that aim to minimize waste across the value chain from sourcing to customer support enabling improvements in both hazardous and non hazardous waste streams.

We actively prevent waste by agreeing with suppliers of IT hardware to deliver in bulk instead of individual packaging.

We also focus on preventing waste by agreeing with IT suppliers to only ship parts that we actually use.

For example, the stands were previously included with every computer monitor ordered, even though we do not use those stands.

Now the stands are no longer included in the order and therefore not produced by the manufacturer, which prevents waste.

Materials used in EUV sources undergo rigorous conditions, including exposure to high temperatures, thermal cycling, corrosive liquid tin, high pressures, pressure cycling and hydrogen.

These materials, such as strategic tantalum alloys and molybdenum, are both limited in availability and costly.

Ongoing trials are focused on preventing the use of virgin material by extending the lifespan of materials used in the system, enhancing material quality in the production process and improving application conditions.

Although addressing our waste performance is a relatively new focus area for us, we have already made some progress.

For example, while our sales have grown by 30.2%, our waste generation from our own operations has increased at a lower rate of 24%.

We have continued to focus on embedding a circular approach more deeply in our design processes.

By thinking about modularity, commonality and repairability during the design phase, we can extend the lifetime of our machines and increase reuse opportunities for parts in the future, aiming to prevent waste.

We have started a project to embed design for reuse in our PGP.

This means that, as an example, the PGP includes a default design of a repair method for any service part.

This enables parts in the installed base systems to be repaired even after any engineering change, so the new functionality may not hinder the repairability of the legacy parts.

Modular design of products and components enables future upgrades, worn parts and components to be replaced as a single unit.

In 2023, we successfully concluded the first phase of a feasibility study demonstrating the manufacturability of modular wafer tables, aiming to secure the reusability of over 2,600 wafer tables by 2028.

We couple learnings from remanufacturing back to the design process.

In 2023, for example, we improved the design of our in line refill module, which we have been remanufacturing since we designed it in our system.

Another example is the learnings from our local repair center team in South Korea.

By enabling the repairability of one of our alignment lasers, they were able to correct for the key failure mode on the shutter’ that lets the light out of the laser module.

Commonality in the parts design process enables a part to be used in multiple contexts within a product and in future product generations.

Starting from 2024, we aim to have zero waste from operations to landfill or incineration from our newly designed products, with repair and reuse requirements as part of the product requirement specification.

In our D E teams, we will set up a specific repair competence', which will enable people to specialize and be the subject matter experts in this field.

These dedicated repair focused teams will work with all functions in D E and across ASML’s business.

We are setting up a packaging waste reduction program with the aim to reduce waste by 2025, with targets toward 2030 under discussion.

In 2024, the feasibility study for modular wafer tables for Wilton and Berlin will be finalized.

As a well maintained ASML system can last for decades and create value for more than one customer, the second principle in our circular economy approach is to extend the lifetime of our products.

ASML aims to maintain systems in use as long as economically and environmentally possible, focusing on service, upgrades and refurbishment of assets, systems and goods.

We are establishing customer contracts to maintain systems in the market for as long as possible, maximizing their value and avoiding obsolescence.

We develop refresh packages to extend the life while maintaining a high performance.

We develop lifetime extension and performance packages productivity enhancement packages (PEPs) and system node extension packages (SNEPs) to enhance the systems’ running period and performance.

We also refurbish systems across the business our refurbishment strategy focuses on buying back systems that are not operational in the field, harvesting parts from decommissioned systems and managing the continued availability of spare parts.

This is key to the extended lifetime service we offer for our systems.

We also re sell systems as long as we can guarantee the parts.

Once a fab needs to upgrade, an older’ lithography system is given a new purpose in a new fab producing comparatively less sophisticated chips, such as accelerometers or radio frequency chips.

We provide our customers with a guaranteed service roadmap until at least 2030.

This means that all the support and necessary services and spare parts required to maintain their systems are expected to be available until at least 2030, subject to export control limitations.

We focus on refurbishing a number of product families: PAS 5500 (with almost 1,800 systems at customer sites worldwide), TWINSCAN XT systems (2,000 systems) and, as of 2021, NXT:1950 1980 systems (1,000 systems).

For the approximately 200 TWINSCAN AT systems that are still in operation, we focus on measures to proactively manage their end of life.

We do this by guaranteeing the availability of spare parts for as long as possible and providing customers with sufficient notice if we can no longer guarantee part supply.

Our target for 2025 is that more than 95% of systems sold in the past 30 years should still be active in the field.

To date, we have refurbished and resold almost 570 lithography systems.

As of the end of 2023, 95% (2022: 95%) of all systems sold in the past 30 years are still active in the field.

Refurbishment is a multi year program in which we continually invest to ensure the supply of more than 2,000 service parts for our PAS platform.

This is achieved either through redesigns, harvesting parts or finding an alternative with the same form, fit and function.

Where this is not possible, we are generally able to secure components through last time buy’ a supplier’s last call’ for a part or component before production switches to its successor.

When a part is no longer available, we redesign the parts.

In 2023, we acquired a PAS 5500 parts repair company in the US that will support our ambition to sustain PAS not only through 2030, but also beyond.

In addition, we intend to extend their capability to accelerate our XT parts repair competence.

We track the spare parts in our portfolio to see how they are being used and identify when we expect to run out of individual items.

For PAS and XT systems, we use this information to update our priorities for redesign.

For TWINSCAN AT systems, we aim to continue supplying parts by harvesting them from systems that are decommissioned by our customers.

We have identified and plan to execute more than 100 redesign projects for nearly 300 parts in the coming years.

This is particularly relevant for electronic parts, for which the evolution of technology has been faster than in any other field.

We will continue to increase our focus on local repair to extend the life of the mature installed base at lower cost, reducing the need to redesign and buy new materials and parts.

The refurbishment activities we have been doing for years on our PAS systems will be extended to cover both XT and NXT systems.

We are currently on track to meet our target of 95%.

ASML is committed to reusing parts, packaging, tools and non product related resources in the value chain, focusing on the return, recondition and repurposing processes.

We optimize return flows by collaborating with customers and suppliers, while learning from system usage and product returns.

We recondition parts and packaging through global and local repair centers, suppliers and partners, at the best location with the lowest environmental impact.

We enable the repurposing of parts, packaging, tools and devices in a new life cycle inside and outside ASML.

We maximize the reuse of system parts, packaging and tools in our value chain to reduce waste and meet customer demand.

Reuse is also a key contributor to our ability to ramp up capacity to cope with strong customer demand.

We retrieve parts from inventory or through repair or harvesting.

Reuse also offers learning opportunities to improve the performance and lifetime of our parts and systems.

We work closely with our customers and suppliers to embed learnings in design and processes throughout the value chain.

We aim to reuse workplace IT assets obtained (e.g.

Instead of assets being disposed of at the end of their economic lifespan, they are used to set up work environments in other buildings where and when possible.

Repair centers: Repair close to where parts are needed to improve parts repair yields by reducing cycle time of root cause analysis and repairs.

Predictable external repair flow: Simplify and standardize return and repair flows to enable us to scale activities.

Circular supplier collaboration: Incentivize suppliers to prioritize reuse over new materials.

Return quality: Ensure that parts are returned with reuse in mind quality returns lead to quality repairs.

Packaging and transportation tools: Increase reuse of packaging, which is the main contributor to our waste (from operations).

Our overall target is to increase the reuse rate of defective parts in ASML factories and in the field to 95% by 2025.

This means successfully reconditioning at least 95% of our parts.

In 2023, our reuse rate of parts was 88%, up from 87% in 2022 on target to achieve our goal.

The savings we generated from reused parts amounted to 1,311 million (2022: 781 million) and the value of scrapped parts was 206 million (2022: 146 million).

We are extending the number of repair centers worldwide to support the reuse of parts by returning, cleaning and reconditioning them close to where they are needed.

Demand for these parts can be driven by our customers needing service parts for their installed base, or by our factories requiring parts for new systems.

Currently, we have several repair centers in Asia (South Korea, Taiwan and China), the US (Wilton, San Diego) and the EU (Veldhoven).

We are investigating our options to extend our network of local repair centers to other locations.

Our repair centers work with local suppliers and specialized repair partners to create a local ecosystem.

By enabling repair and reuse activities and taking ownership of repairs close to where materials are needed, we are able to reduce logistics time, cost of stocking parts and our environmental impact (by reducing scrap and GHG emissions).

Our customers benefit from reduced service costs and improved material availability.

In 2023, we launched a dedicated cross company team to further explore local reuse activities in Taiwan, and have begun the process of setting up a similar operation in the US.

We intend to empower local teams to initiate reuse activities, as local business requirements and situations may vary.

The central reuse team provides guidance and support where needed and drives roll out of local best practices across other locations.

With over 1,200 m2 of cleanroom, our dedicated reuse facilities in Veldhoven will be instrumental in this.

We are working to increase the scalability and predictability of our reuse flows in order to future proof return and recondition processes to deal with growing demand.

This includes forecasting repairs to help suppliers prepare capacity.

By combining service and factory return flows and simplifying and automating operational planning and repair order management we are increasing the availability of repaired parts.

Our aim is to maximize reuse of parts and ensure it is the preferred option over new purchases.

We are collaborating with suppliers to incentivize reuse over new purchases.

We are investigating transferring used parts back to our suppliers to repair, refurbish or harvest for reuse in their new buying process, giving them more flexibility in how they can reuse parts.

In 2023, we investigated how to support a new collaboration model with suppliers for reusing materials and how to adjust our processes and systems to enable it.

We piloted the new way of working with eight suppliers and have started engagements with additional suppliers.

Challenges that occur downstream in the value chain during the repair phase often have their origins upstream and are related to the quality of returns, for example through incorrect labeling or packaging.

In 2023, we started piloting barcode scanning of defect parts in the return flow to support correct labeling.

In 2024, this project will ramp up to a program to also cover all root causes of poor return quality.

Valuable transportation materials such as packaging, locking and plug materials are used to safely transport our modules and systems, either from our suppliers to our factories or from our factories to our customers.

Instead of being thrown away once they reach their destination, these materials are reused.

Before parts are returned for reuse, they undergo an identification process and quality check, followed by the logistical and financial processes required to bring them back into the supply chain (either to the original module suppliers or to ASML). Our goal is to standardize these processes and create a network related solution to enable high flexibility and reduce transport, which also reduces our CO2e footprint.

We are improving the reuse of packaging, lockings and plugs from the field and factory.

We aim toward 100% recyclable packaging with an eye on minimizing waste and environmental impact.

In 2023, we made progress in reusing thousands of small auxiliary materials, such as plugs, flanges, caps and brackets.

These are now being reused for system parts in our factories or for shipping machines to our customers.

Furthermore, we developed a solution to embed the reuse requirements in our design processes and this will be fully implemented in 2024.

The circular innovation program (CIP) is a collaboration with ImpactX and Brainport Industries.

It is a four day tailor made program focusing on building a stronger relationship with our supply base by creating circular competencies.

In 2023, we consolidated CIP with the participation of eight suppliers divided into two cohorts.

We run two cohorts per year and four suppliers are invited each time.

Through the program we are able to close business loops, boost supplier impact and strengthen collaboration overall.

The benefits are the creation of a shared vision on the circular economy, peer learning, and the joint building of competencies and knowledge around reusing products, parts and materials in the value chain.

The participants invited so far are first tier suppliers however, we want to extend the program to other tiers as well.

Additionally, we have the ambition to expand CIP beyond the Brainport Eindhoven region in the Netherlands, to other locations around the world.

In 2024, we will have more focus on the reuse program, with teams dedicated to repairs, reverse logistics, reuse related engineering, local harvesting and repair centers worldwide.

In the context of supplier capacity, our supplier backlog is building up.

We need stronger supplier collaboration, focusing on reuse over new, and working on forecasting and planning of repairs to reduce supplier repair cycle time.

We are implementing a structural improvement roadmap related to repair and reuse across all functions in ASML in order to meet our 2025 targets.

ASML’s aim is to recycle material at end of life, focusing on the collection, analysis and reporting processes.

We define the collection and sorting methods in collaboration with partners to increase recycling rates of both hazardous and non hazardous materials, including local recycling at end of life and construction waste.

We identify drivers of waste, gain insights into reasons for disposal, provide feedback to prevent waste, and improve designs and opportunities for recycling.

Following our principles hierarchy, recycling materials is the final step in the process, in case we have not been able to prevent the waste, extend the lifetime of our systems and assets, or reuse our resources.

As our company grows, so too does the number of our employees, the number of systems we produce, and the number and size of our facilities.

We are determined to decouple growth from our overall resource consumption.

Recycling our waste plays a key role in closing the material loop by 2030, we want to avoid energy recovery, incineration and landfill as much as possible.

Our aim is to recycle materials instead of incinerating or disposing of them to landfill.

Understanding our waste streams is key to identifying opportunities to increase recycling of both hazardous and non hazardous waste.

We aim to maximize waste separation at our sites to enable increased recycling rates and easy recycling at the waste haulers'.

The effective monitoring and managing of waste relies on the availability of detailed and accurate insights into waste streams to and from ASML.

We manage our waste through proper classification, separation, and safe disposal by waste vendors.

Our contracts with waste vendors state the need for compliance with local legislation and we aim to improve how this is monitored.

Waste data is managed through our myEHS system, which collects information from our local waste vendors along with the relevant supporting documentation, such as invoices.

The data entered is checked internally and by an independent party against the supporting documentation.

Non hazardous waste accounted for 95% (2022: 95% (6,533 tonnes)) of our total waste in 2023, of which 53% was recycled.

Hazardous waste accounted for 5% (458 tonnes) of our total waste generated, compared with 5% (380 tonnes) in 2022.

Recycling materials conserves natural resources and reduces carbon emissions.

In the Netherlands, after investigating non product related activities, some construction waste such as concrete has been reused (after processing) in the construction of new buildings.

Our waste intensity in 2023 was 300 kg per m revenue, down from 315 kg per m revenue in 2022.

This remains below the pre COVID 19 waste intensity.

To achieve our target of 209 kg per m revenue, we need to scale up our efforts to reduce our waste streams in absolute terms and improve our recycling rate.

We are increasing our efforts to reduce waste by setting up specific projects on packaging, general waste and hazardous materials.

The main contributors to our packaging waste are wooden pallets.

We need to extend their reuse even further and make a transition in waste treatment, from energy recovery to recycling.

Another big challenge we are working on is to reduce packaging waste generated by the materials used to transport our systems and parts around the world.

General waste from our offices and facilities represented 28% of the total waste in 2023.

We have started projects on separation and sorting to improve its recyclability and prevent its generation.

Our aim is to avoid landfill and incineration by 2030.

In 2023, this accounted for 43% of our waste, including hazardous substances and construction waste.

We are currently piloting an ASML solution which aims to reduce our hazardous waste by approximately 65%.

Our target is to achieve a recycling rate (excluding construction waste) of 90% by 2025.

We saw a significant decrease in the recycling rate, from 75% in 2022 to 55% in 2023.

The lower recycling rate in 2023 can be explained by an increased focus on our waste.

New insights show that waste companies reported recycling rates using different definitions.

We will continue to improve the quality of data next year and start initiatives with our waste companies to increase the recycling rate.

Waste reduction program During the year we launched a program to reduce waste coming from non product related resources.

This program features several different initiatives, with the first focusing on creating clear governance processes to improve waste recycling, and working on obtaining more accurate and reliable data from our waste haulers.

We also gained a better overview of our waste and mapped our waste streams at the Veldhoven site, which represent 60% of our total waste.

We created a circularity plan for our five largest industrial sites to improve our waste data quality and recycling rate.

Identifying where the waste comes from (inbound versus operations) by organizing Gemba Walks (opportunities for staff to walk the work floor) to see the waste in the warehouse, factory and offices, and also by visiting our waste haulers to understand how our waste is processed.

Examining what the waste consists of through a detailed sorting test (performed by one of our waste haulers).

Assessing the quantity of hazardous and non hazardous waste.

Proposing actions and process optimizations to achieve our targets.

In 2023, we started local remanufacturing of modules that capture tin from the EUV light source.

As tin is a consumable, these tin catch’ modules fill up and get contaminated by design.

Local remanufacturing enables fast, efficient reuse with minimal shipment miles, as well as the possibility to reclaim tin for the next cycle of use.

We actively support extending the life cycle of IT assets by giving them another life outside of ASML. In 2023, we donated over 300 laptops to multiple charities, mainly in the area of children's education.

All IT assets that ASML can no longer use are professionally processed by a specialized partner after the end of their life cycle, with the aim of life cycle extension outside of ASML.

We have improved the accuracy of our waste reporting by increasing actual measurements of the amounts of waste at our main production site in Veldhoven.

Developing circularity master plans for infrastructure and facility related activities at the largest ASML industrial sites Veldhoven, San Diego, Wilton, Linkou and Tainan.

The master plans cover three work streams with initiatives to: 1.

Implementing a specific waste reduction program for non product related resources: a. Recognizing that waste is a challenge across the organization b.

Focusing on our real estate, global manufacturing and IT department in the coming years to reduce waste c.

Improving waste data integrity (including data completeness and relevance, among others).

This is being rolled out firstly in our large factories and includes gap assessments, construction waste definitions, improved reporting and an overview of waste haulers e.

Implementing a program in the Netherlands to improve waste segregation upstream downstream, as part of our objective to increase waste recycling in the country to more than 90% f. Engaging with a new waste hauler in Taiwan.

We anticipate that this change should lead to a 46% improvement of our waste recycling in Tainan and 18% in Linkou in 2024 g.

Implementing reuse of furniture in Taiwan h. Starting to audit waste management in our factory in Wilton (US) i.

Improving scrutiny of accurate binning of waste categories in San Diego (US).

This will provide better direction for future waste reduction initiatives j.

As we continue to expand our facilities, we aim to maximize the recycling of waste from our construction activities.

In 2023, we began to assess the completeness, accuracy and consistency of our construction waste reporting at four of our large industrial sites.

Our conclusion is that we need to focus on two specific areas.

Firstly, we must improve the data collection process around our construction waste streams.

Secondly, we must improve data quality as part of our circularity roadmap.

This is a significant challenge, because it means identifying construction waste over several hundred projects every year, some of which have already started, with multiple construction waste haulers.

We currently have circularity master plans in place at our five biggest industrial sites and are working on improving the waste data.

Despite our many initiatives, achieving our waste recycling targets remains a challenge.

Our actions in 2023 included the decision to reorganize how we manage our waste.

In the months ahead, we intend to investigate the impact of this decision and prepare to implement an organizational structure that will be designed to help us achieve our recycling rate target.

Based on the insights gained in 2023, we will re evaluate the recycling rate target set for 2025.

When implemented, the changes will impact how we categorize and manage our waste and will be designed to improve the integrity of waste data across the company.

These enhancements will enable us to extend our waste reporting to all sites during 2024.

Our so called piranha solution used in etching processes to remove organic residues from substrates represents about two thirds of our hazardous waste.

We will investigate specific solutions, such as the feasibility of reprocessing our piranha solution for reuse as sulfuric acid in a different market.

We will also investigate the feasibility of replacing single use disposable plastics for food and drinks in other large industrial sites with reusable alternatives, which we believe will lead to further reduction of our waste.

Finally, we will investigate scaling up our waste segregation collection and sorting onsite to improve the recycling rate.

Climate change and increased water demand combine to mean that droughts have become more extreme and unpredictable, and water is becoming a scarce resource in some locations.

Water consumption at ASML accounts for only a tiny fraction of the water consumed by the semiconductor industry.

Our water related risk is therefore low compared to that of our customers, who use a significant amount of water during the semiconductor manufacturing processes.

Despite our relatively low level of water usage, as a responsible business we promote efficient water use and recycling across our sites and processes.

In our factories, we use water in three key ways: Firstly, we use it to remove heat loads and maintain the systems at a constant temperature.

Internal cooling circuits are all designed as closed loop’ (recycling) systems to limit water consumption.

Secondly, these heat loads are eventually removed in cooling towers using evaporation of lower quality water.

Finally, DUV systems use ultrapure water in the immersion hood this water is currently only partially recycled.

Our water consumption in 2023 remained stable around 1% higher at 1,173,990 m3, if compared to 1,161,850 m3 in 2022.

Social at a glance We aim to have a positive social impact by providing an attractive workplace, ensuring a responsible supply chain, supporting an innovation ecosystem and being a valued partner in our communities.

We depend on our suppliers to help deliver our innovations.

They are critical to our value chain and our ambition to be a sustainable leader in the semiconductor industry.

We play an active role in the communities where we operate, recognizing that when the community thrives, we thrive.

We need to empower our employees to deliver our vision by ensuring they are proud to be part of ASML and engaged with our ambitions as a company.

We never innovate in isolation because developing technology in collaboration with partners across the innovation ecosystem maximizes our collective impact.

ASML’s focus on technology and its supportive culture mean you can go wherever your talent and ambition take you.

Making a difference Anya Kish moved from Russia to the US for her graduate studies in plasma physics.

That willingness to take opportunities however they present themselves has seen her build a career at ASML as a problem solver who thrives under pressure.

She now works as project manager for the light source for our next extreme ultraviolet lithography system.

Friends from outside ASML sometimes ask me about working in technology as a woman or working in the US as a Russian.

Those questions surprise me, as who I am has never been a factor in my experience and the opportunities I have had at ASML.

Yes, the industry has been male dominated, but it is changing.

When I started eight years ago, I used to joke that I was given my own private bathroom, as I was the only woman on my floor.

And in my experience, ideas are always judged on their merit.

There are programs to support different groups within ASML. They do great things bringing people together and raising issues, but people here really don’t need much education.

I joined ASML because I was blown away by the technology as a student.

I recently moved on to a new stage in my journey here, managing the entire NXE:3800 source that will be introduced to customers in 2024.

But even now, I sometimes go down to the lab just to look at a source prototype with its thousands of components.

That we can make that work seems almost like magic, even after eight years of working for ASML.

ASML’s senior management needed an update, and fast.

As the subject matter expert was absent and I was onsite, I was asked to give a presentation the next day.

I had no prior knowledge of the issue, but spent the night learning everything I could.

I read all the materials and phoned round colleagues for more information.

The presentation went so well that I was asked to head up a task force to address the issue.

A year later, the project won awards from key customers and within ASML, and mirror lifetime had gone from the number one customer issue to something people hardly ever mentioned.

That unexpected opportunity was the first real step on my project management journey.

And it highlights two of my favorite things about working at ASML: The technology and the culture.

I couldn’t have given that presentation without the support of the colleagues who took my calls and answered my questions.

The supportive culture is why I feel confident to take on new challenges here: There are always people around who want to help you and ASML succeed.

I was on a trip to Veldhoven when key customers reported an issue that was impacting the lifetime of mirrors used in our EUV light sources.

This had become our number one customer issue and could have delayed the introduction of EUV lithography into mass production.

I had wanted to work at ASML ever since I was a graduate student, and a course mate told me about the company.

I read more online and watched all the YouTube videos I could find.

Soon after graduating, I was lucky enough to get a temporary contract and then a permanent position as an engineer in the Source Performance team in San Diego, working to improve the performance of EUV light sources.

A fantastic manager suggested that I may have a talent for project management.

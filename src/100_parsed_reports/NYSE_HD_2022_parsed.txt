CEO LETTER

OUR SUCCESS STARTS 
WITH OUR CULTURE

We organize our approach to corporate responsibility around three key pillars: Focusing on Our People, Operating 
Sustainably and Strengthening Our Communities. 

When I joined The Home Depot more 
than 22 years ago, I could never 
have imagined that I would have the 
opportunity to lead such an incredible 
organization. Prior to becoming CEO, 
I had the privilege to work in multiple 
departments across the organization. 
One thing that has always been clear 
to me is that our values-driven culture 
and passion for our customers has been 
instrumental to our success.  

Built around our core values, our 
approach to ESG centers around three 
key pillars – Focus on Our People, 
Operate Sustainably, and Strengthen Our 
Communities. By identifying these three 
pillars, we can concentrate on the areas 
where we can have the greatest impact.  
Our 2022 ESG Report details the daily 
work we do to support these three 
pillars, as well as the progress we 
made in 2021 thanks to the dedication 
and ingenuity of our associates and 
suppliers.  

Our focus on people centers around 
continuously striving to create a work 
environment that is inclusive, engaging, 
and rewarding to associates. Our 
associates’ outstanding performance 
in 2021 enabled 100% of our stores 
to qualify for Success Sharing bonus 
payments to non-management 
associates. We also offer training and 
development that transforms jobs into 
careers, which is reflected in the fact 
that approximately 90% of our U.S. 
store leaders began as hourly 
associates.  

Our U.S. workforce is more ethnically 
diverse than the U.S. working 
population. In addition, we increased 
the representation of female and 
underrepresented minority groups across 
our managers and above cohort in the 
U.S. during 2021.

“Built around our core values, our approach to ESG centers 

around three key pillars – Focus on Our People, Operate 

Sustainably, and Strengthen Our Communities. By identifying 

these three pillars, we can concentrate on the areas where 

we can have the greatest impact.”

– Ted Decker, CEO and president of The Home Depot

Our efforts to operate sustainably 
begin with our understanding that our 
biggest impact on the environment 
comes from the products we sell. 
Our partnership with suppliers allows 
us to give our customers access 
to hundreds of products that are 
good for their homes, good for the 
environment, and good for their 
wallets.  In 2021, we estimate our 
customers’ purchases of Energy 
Star products helped reduce annual 
electricity use by 7 billion kilowatt 
hours, saving $950 million on 
energy costs, and lowering carbon 
emissions by 4.9 million metric tons. 
Our water-saving products allowed 
customers to reduce consumption 
by over 66 billion gallons.  

We believe our associates 
should reflect the customers and 
communities we serve. In 2021, 
approximately 36% of our U.S. new 
hires were women, while more than 
57% of U.S. new hires were from an 
underrepresented minority group.   

Our commitment to diversity also 
extends to our supplier relationships. 
In 2021, we increased our spend with 
diverse suppliers to $3.3 billion and 
have announced a goal to achieve 
$5 billion in direct annual spend 
with diverse suppliers by 2025. We 
also completed our goal to launch a 
Tier II supplier diversity program to 
encourage our suppliers to spend 
with diverse businesses. We will 
continue to push forward in this area 
by partnering with organizations like 
the Billion Dollar Roundtable, an 
association geared at celebrating 
corporations that spend at least  
$1 billion per year with minority- and 
woman-owned suppliers, to further 
amplify our supplier diversity efforts.

We also value our nonprofit partners that 
enable The Home Depot Foundation 
to improve the homes and lives of U.S. 
veterans, train skilled tradespeople to fill 
the labor gap, and support communities 
affected by natural disasters. 

In 2021, the Foundation achieved a 
milestone of ten years and over 
$400 million invested in support of 
veteran causes, on track to contribute 
half of a billion dollars to veteran causes 
by 2025. 

While we have made significant 
progress, there is more work to do. On 
Pages 9 and 10 of this report, you will 
see the goals we’ve set as we strive 
to build a better and more sustainable 
business.  

We know that when we invest in running 
a responsible, sustainable company, we 
make our business stronger, more agile, 
and more resilient. 2021 was another 
year filled with great accomplishments, 
and I want to thank our associates and 
supplier partners for the many ways they 
enable us to do our part and live our 
values every day.

Ted Decker
CEO and president of The Home Depot

We also made progress in 2021 by 
operating more sustainably in our 
own business, reducing electricity 
consumption in our U.S. stores by 
approximately 11% year-over-year. 
We cut U.S. store electricity usage a 
remarkable 50% since 2010. A hallmark 
of progress in this area has been the 
transition to LED overhead lighting in 
our U.S. stores, which join our Canada 
and Mexico stores in having nearly all of 
interior lighting powered by LED bulbs.  
While we remain focused on reducing 
our energy consumption, we are also 
making progress towards our goal of 
producing or procuring 100% renewable 
electricity equivalent to the electricity 
needs for all Home Depot facilities 
worldwide by 2030.  

We focus on strengthening our 
communities by giving back financially 
and through our associates’ time 
and efforts dedicated to Team Depot 
volunteer activities – a hallmark of who 
we are. In 2021, approximately 14,000 
associates volunteered in communities 
across 150 cities nationwide. Our 
Team Depot volunteers helped our 
communities prepare and respond 
to natural disasters like tornados, 
hurricanes, and wildfires, while also 
achieving more than 1.25 million hours 
of service to veterans since 2011.  

“We know that when we invest in 
running a responsible, sustainable 
company, we make our business 
stronger, more agile, and 
more resilient.”

ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS  
& SETTING PRIORITIES

We value seeing ESG impact and opportunities through our operational lens and also through 
the lenses of our stakeholders. 

As the largest home improvement 
retailer in the world, we have the unique 
opportunity to create positive impacts 
across a broad number of stakeholders. 
We have also been reminded over the 
last two years how quickly our world 
can change, which is why we continue 
our practice of proactive engagement 
and provide numerous channels for 
feedback, so we can remain attentive 
to the concerns and needs of our 
stakeholders. 

We have learned over the years that one 
of the best ways for us to make sure we 
understand the relevant environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) impacts 
of our business and the current areas 
of focus of our many stakeholders is 
to engage with our stakeholders. This 
engagement comes through multiple 
channels. 

We receive constant feedback from 
our customers through the more than 
a billion and a half transactions across 
our stores and digital channels annually. 

We survey our approximately 500,000 
associates to measure how emotionally 
connected they are to their work. We 
collaborate with our vendors and suppliers 
in an effort to lessen the environmental 
impact of the products we sell. Individuals 
and organizations from around the 
globe reach out to us with questions 
or concerns about our operations or 
products. We meet with shareholders and 
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) 
interested in our business practices. 
We take part in industry efforts to raise 
awareness about the ESG responsibilities 
we all share. 

Our ongoing interactions may be formal 
or informal, as detailed in our ESG Priority 
Assessment Framework on Page 7. 
These interactions help validate our own 
priority assessment; they also help us 
gauge the impact of our business, refine 
ESG priorities, measure our progress and 
design ways to improve.

By better understanding our impact 
and collaborating with stakeholders, we 
position our company to set objectives 
that allow us to contribute to building a 
better business, workplace and world. 

Our Sustainability Council, composed of 
representatives from different areas of 
the business, oversees our approach to 
sustainability. Members of the Council 
share stakeholder feedback from their 
functional areas. The Council focuses on 
several key areas, as shown below. 

The Council meets twice a year, and 
its chair presents our sustainability 
strategy and activities to the Board of 
Directors annually. We also provide 
quarterly updates to our Nominating 
and Corporate Governance Committee 
regarding our ESG engagement.  
Our ESG priorities and plans are 
communicated internally and externally 
via various channels, including in this 
annual report.

FAQ: WE ALL OWN 
SUSTAINABILITY

Reducing The Home Depot’s environmental impact is essential to our efforts to build 
a better business, workplace and world.

Home Depot’s chief sustainability 
officer Ron Jarvis has spent more than 
two decades driving sustainability 
improvements at The Home Depot. Here 
he offers insights into our progress.

Who drives ESG at The
Home Depot?

Many associates and business leaders 
throughout our enterprise! They take 
pride in improving their departments and 
businesses in multiple ESG aspects. Our 
leadership understands that an effective 
environmental, social and governance 
strategy cannot happen in isolation. It is 
not the sole responsibility of a corporate 
ESG team. Rather, our ESG strategy 
must reflect The Home Depot’s core 
values, and it must be embedded in all 
aspects of how we run our business. 
Everybody owns it.

How have associates helped drive 
ESG progress at The Home Depot?

One of our eight core values is Do The 
Right Thing, which drives our associates 
to find new ways that our organization 
can reduce its environmental impact. 

This can be seen through our packaging 
team who looks for ways to reduce the 
package footprints and ways to use more 
sustainable materials for our private-label 
products (see Page 55).  

Another example are our associates 
who work to find ways to upcycle the 
packaging waste in our stores and 
supply chain into new products like Trex 
composite decking. 

How is The Home Depot helping 
customers increase the sustainability 
of their homes and businesses?

Our Eco Actions program, which builds 
on our original Eco Options program 
that we launched in 2007, helps our 
customers take on more sustainable DIY 
projects and choose greener products 
that can save water, conserve energy 
or are formulated to reduce certain 
chemicals. Products can only qualify for 
this distinction if manufacturers provide 
third-party verification of environmental 
claims that meet our program’s 
requirements. This program also offers 
customers green project ideas and tips, 
for example, how to grow an organic 
garden (see Page 50). 

In addition, we encourage our customers 
to drop off used compact fluorescent 
light bulbs and rechargeable batteries 
for recycling. In 2021, we collected 
1,162,800 pounds of recycled batteries, a 
24% increase since 2014 (see Page 54). 

We also help our customers go greener in 
ways that may be less apparent to them. 
For example, we offer circularity-centered 
products like our Home Depot-branded 
moving boxes, made from 100% post-
consumer recycled paper fiber (see Page 
45), as well as composite deck boards 
made from recycled plastic waste from 
our stores. We continue to make progress 
on our goal to exclude expanded 
polystyrene (EPS) foam and polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) film from our private-brand 
product packaging by the end of 2023. 
When customers rent tools from us, they 
help avoid the environmental impact of 
new product manufacturing. Another 
example: Our stores have cut electricity 
consumption 50% since 2010, providing 
our customers a lower energy intensive 
shopping environment.

Is sustainability a competitive 
advantage for The Home Depot?

Overall, we believe good business 
decisions drive sustainability. 
Examples of this can be seen 
through the investments we’ve made 
to create the most efficient supply 
chain in home improvement. These 
investments have helped us reduce 
the number of trucks needed and 
distance traveled to get our products 
from our supplier to our customers, 
while also reducing fuel emissions. 
Another example of this is our store 
investments, part of which included 
transitioning stores to LED lighting, 
which helped us reduce operating 
costs and electricity consumption. 

We also believe that by working with 
our suppliers to bring innovative 
and sustainable products to market, 
we help our customers create more 
sustainable homes and workplaces. 
Our efforts to drive innovation can be 
seen in every aisle of the store, and 
we believe this is a key differentiator 
in the market.  

We also want to see sustainability 
be the norm for our entire industry. 
We are encouraged when we see 
other retailers take big swings and 
do innovative things that push all of 
us to do a better job of protecting the 
planet, and we hope the innovation 
that we bring through our operations 
and products motivates others to do 
the same.

DIVERSITY, EQUITY  
& INCLUSION

We strive to create an environment centered around our eight core values, where diversity, equity and inclusion fuel 
opportunities for our associates, communities, and suppliers.

While our office of Diversity & Inclusion has 
existed within the company for more than 
a decade to help diversify our workforce 
and support change in our communities, 
we expanded in 2020 and renamed it to fit 
an enhanced mission: Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion (DEI). Adding equity to our focus 
reflects our desire to promote fairness, 
remove bias and ensure all of our associates 
and business partners have access to the 
resources they need to succeed at work. 

In 2021, we met our goal to expand our 
associate resource groups (ARGs) beyond 
our Store Support Center (corporate 
facility) to include more associates and 
increase engagement and participation. 
Through our new associate engagement 
platform, Yammer, all our U.S. associates 
are now able to access our ARGs. We also 
leveraged Yammer to reach more associates 
with C.A.R.E. talks, a series of diversity 
discussions that Champion Awareness, 
Respect, and Equity for all associates. Learn 
more here: Page 26. 

We were also able to meet our goal to 
launch a Tier II supplier diversity program 
in 2021. Beyond the $3.3 billion we spent 
with diverse Tier I (direct) suppliers last year, 
our new program will help us measure and 
encourage our Tier I suppliers to spend 
more with diverse businesses. Find out more 
about our supplier diversity efforts on 
Page 60. 

At The Home Depot, we define diversity, 
equity and inclusion as: 

Diversity: Composition of people, such 
as their similarities and differences (e.g., 
gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation) 

Equity: Norms, practices and policies in 
place that ensure just and fair opportunities 
and outcomes, allowing individuals to reach 
their full potential  

Inclusion: How we embrace and enable 
our associates to feel safe, respected, 
engaged, motivated and valued for who 
they are and their contributions 

 Learn more about how we work with 
our community partners across the 
nation and how spending with diverse 
suppliers benefits our company and 
our communities on Pages 58-61.  

KEY AREAS OF FOCUS 
At The Home Depot, we focus on three key 
areas to create meaningful change through 
thoughtful actions that align with all eight 
of our core values. 

ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT 

•   Increasing diverse representation      
     throughout our organization 

•   Creating an environment where every   
     associate feels included and valued for   
     who they are

•   Promoting equal opportunity in  
     recruitment, hiring, training,  
     development and advancement

COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS

•   Striving to close the wealth gap

•   Advancing education for all

SUPPLIER DIVERSITY 

•   Increasing our penetration and spend    
     with diverse suppliers

•   Developing diverse suppliers by 
     providing mentorship and shared      
     resources

We have many initiatives currently in the 
works, including an expansion of our 
existing Retool Your School program to 
further strengthen our commitment to 
historically black colleges and universities 
(HBCUs). This expansion, set to launch in 
2023, will include more programming and 
a broader reach (See Page 62).  

In addition, we are working to enlarge our 
network of external partner organizations 
to enhance the career development of our 
female, minority, LGBTQ+ and veteran 
associates. 

CHECK IT OUT
When Khareem Mitchell started 
with The Home Depot in 2018, 
he discovered a workplace where 
his personal principles aligned 
with company values. His Afro-
Hispanic roots play a big role in 
how he conducts his life — both 
inside and outside of work.

DOING THE RIGHT THING

Derek Bottoms, chief diversity officer and vice president of associate relations, explains how diversity, equity  
and inclusion align with our company values.

Mission Statement
The Home Depot ignites the 

doer in all of us to build a culture 

of understanding, acceptance 

and appreciation.

Vision Statement
The Home Depot is building 

a more diverse, equitable and 

inclusive organization, within our 

enterprise and the communities 

we are proud to serve. Grounded 

in our core values, we have the 

conviction, capabilities and tools 

to make a difference for our 

associates, community partners 

and suppliers.

What does diversity, equity and 
inclusion mean at The Home Depot?

At The Home Depot, our values guide us 
on everything we do. They serve as our 
foundation, and they are embedded in our 
culture. Our expanded focus on diversity, 
equity and inclusion supports all eight of our 
core values, including respect for all people, 
giving back and building strong relationships 
with other associates and our customers. We 
strive to build a workplace and retail space 
that reflect the communities we serve. A 
diverse and inclusive workplace also creates 
shareholder value by providing different 
perspectives and fresh ideas that spark 
innovation. 

On the community side, we are continuing 
to partner with local and national 
organizations focused on closing the wealth 
gap and advancing education for all. We 
continue to amplify our supplier diversity 
efforts to drive innovation, economic 
opportunities and shareholder value by 
directing more of our dollars, directly and 
indirectly, toward diverse businesses. We 
look to partner with organizations like the 
Billion Dollar Roundtable whose mission 
aligns with our focus areas. To further our 
commitment to supplier diversity, we are 
also seeking to achieve $5 billion in direct 
annual spend with diverse suppliers by 
2025. See Page 60 to learn more about our 
supplier diversity efforts. 

What project excites you? 

I’m excited about our plans to expand 
Our Retool Your School program in 2023, 
which has provided campus beautification 
funding to historically black colleges 
and universities (HBCUs) since 2009. By 
expanding the reach of this program, we 
can further strengthen our commitment 
to HBCUs and their students, including 
through career development opportunities. 
(Learn more on Page 62). 

What are some ways The Home Depot 
is driving progress for its stakeholders? 

We recently expanded our associate 
resource groups (ARGs) to all associates 
companywide, including in stores and 
distribution centers. Previously, these groups 
were only available to our Store Support 
Center (SSC) associates. (Go to Page 26 
to learn more.) In an aligned effort, we are 
identifying tools and platforms to directly 
engage with our hourly front-line associates 
to share DEI-related information and 
resources. 

We also are raising awareness of DEI and 
its importance by modernizing our learning 
materials; holding listening sessions where 
executives hear from associates across the 
organization; and focusing on recruiting and 
talent-planning strategies that emphasize 
diversity and inclusion.

BUILDING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE
Our diverse workforce strengthens our competitive advantages and reflects the customers and communities we serve. A comparison 
against U.S. Department of Labor data shows that our U.S. workforce is more ethnically diverse than the nation’s working 
population. In 2021, we also expanded the number and percentage of women and minorities at the manager level and above. These 
charts reflect the demographics of The Home Depot’s U.S. workforce from fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2021. Certain percentages may 
not sum to 100% due to rounding or, in 2020 and 2021, some associates choosing not to self-identify by race/ethnicity or gender. 
2019 percentages included these non-disclosing associates in the white or male categories, as applicable.

ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT
ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT

Associate engagement is the emotional connection associates have to our company and our goals. It is vital to 
The Home Depot’s culture and success.

Voice of the Associate Survey 

Highly engaged associates care about 
their work and the performance of The 
Home Depot. Our passion is to create 
an engaging and inclusive workplace; 
we do so by proactively engaging with 
our associates, while also listening and 
responding to their feedback.    

In 2021, we introduced an additional 
Voice of the Associate survey to all 
our associates. Our two Voice of 
the Associate surveys – Census and 
Pulse – provided us the opportunity 
to hear from our associates at least 
twice in 2021. Our Census survey is an 
annual in-depth look at our associate’s 
engagement and satisfaction with their 
job and with the Home Depot, while 
our Pulse survey is typically shorter 
and seeks feedback on specific topics.  
Based on the Voice of the Associate 
2021 Census survey, we saw the 
highest engagement numbers across 
the enterprise that we have seen in the 
past few years.     

In addition, we also added two 
additional surveys – Onboarding and 
Exit, into our “Lifecycle Listening” 
toolbelt. These additional surveys 
allow us to intentionally connect with 
associates at specific moments within 
their career at The Home Depot. 

 Engagement Platform 
In 2021, our new associate 
engagement platform - Yammer, which 
was launched at the end of fiscal 2020 
- helped create new collaboration 
spaces and opportunities for reaching 
associates across the business. 

Whether through on-site desktops or 
on-the-go mobile devices, more than 
450,000 associates across the U.S. 
and Canada have access to Yammer.    
With more than 650 active 

communities in the network, the digital 
hub links associates to both their local 
co-workers and corporate support across 
North America. It serves as a central hub 
to recognize associates for living our 
values, promote company news, cultivate 
connections between front-line and 
corporate associates and fuel the orange-
blooded entrepreneurial spirit that’s part 
of what drives our business every day. 

Success Sharing and  
Compensation Enhancements 

Our philosophy of taking care of our 
people and motivating them to deliver 
a superior customer experience 
shapes our profit-sharing program for 
hourly associates. Success Sharing 
provides semi-annual cash awards for 
performance against our business plan, 
including sales and productivity goals. 
The program has granted awards totaling 
more than $1 billion to associates over 
the last two years.

The outstanding performance of our 
associates in fiscal 2021 enabled 100% 
of stores to qualify for Success Sharing in 
both the first and second half of the year. 
This resulted in record award payments 
to our non-management associates of 
approximately $739 million.    

We also continue to make investments in 
our associates – recent actions include 
our decision at the end of 2020 to 
transition our COVID-related enhanced 
associate pay and benefits to permanent 
compensation enhancements for front-
line, hourly associates. In addition, we 
continued matching contributions under 
our FutureBuilder 401(k) Plan, and merit-
based salary increases. 

 Our People: Pay Equity 
The Home Depot’s commitment to doing 
the right thing and taking care of our 
people extends to our pay practices. To 
ensure that we are paying our associates 
fairly, we conduct an annual analysis of 
our pay and compensation practices 
for our U.S. associates (who comprise 
approximately 89% of our workforce), in 
consultation with expert third-party firms 
following industry-leading standards. 
Our review of our U.S. associates’ total 
W-2 compensation for calendar year 
2021, including base pay, cash bonuses, 
and stock, showed that, adjusting 
for relevant factors such as tenure, 
position, location and hours worked, 
associates who identified as female 
earned approximately 101% of what male 
associates earned, and associates who 
identified as members of a racial or ethnic 
minority earned approximately 99% of 
what non-minority associates earned. Not 
adjusting for those factors, our analysis 
showed that the median annualized W-2 
pay for U.S. associates who identified 
as female was 98% of the median for 
men, and that the median pay for racial/
ethnic minority associates in the U.S. 
was 94% of the median for non-minority 
associates. The Leadership Development 
and Compensation Committee of the 
Board of Directors, which is tasked 
with providing oversight of our human 
capital management strategy and our 
diversity and inclusion efforts, receives 
regular updates on these findings. We 
will continue to strive to ensure equal pay 
across our organization.

ASSOCIATE RESOURCE 
GROUPS

Our associate resource groups promote inclusion and support diversity. 

Our associate resource groups (ARGs) are led by associates and sponsored by executive leaders. They drive associate engagement 
and promote inclusion across our company through fostering professional development, raising cultural awareness, celebrating 
diversity, and community outreach. 

We have seven U.S. ARGs, each supporting the company’s business objectives and policies, particularly those related to developing 
our associates, creating diversity awareness and engaging diverse community partners. 

In 2021, we revised our ARG structure to further support the career development of associates who voluntarily lead these groups. We 
also achieved our goal of expanding associate resource groups to include more of our people. We hosted more than 70 ARG events 
virtually in 2021 to celebrate diversity, raise cultural awareness and foster professional development. We continue to expand outreach 
to associates to encourage their engagement in our ARGs.

The Home Depot was 
named to Forbes’ list of Best

2019, 2021 and 2022.

SPOTLIGHT: C.A.R.E. TALKS

We launched Caring Conversations in 2020 in response to the unrest in our community. The virtual events for all associates included panel 
discussions where senior company leaders shared candid stories about race and ethnicity, and experts from outside our company educated 
associates about civil rights, laws, voting and more. In 2021, Caring Conversations evolved into C.A.R.E. Talks, a series of diversity discussions 
that Champion Awareness, Respect, and Equity for all associates. These discussions include external speaker series, panel discussions, and small 
group listening sessions, and we occasionally partnered with our Associate Resource Groups on elevating keynote speakers in this format. At the 
enterprise level, we hosted 13 C.A.R.E. Talks in 2021. These diversity discussions will be expanded to include additional formats in 2022. 

Comments from Associate Feedback Survey:

Supplier Diversity Panel: “The impact HD and many of its suppliers have on making their associates have better lives is inspiring and heartfelt. 
Love working for and with folks that care. Pun intended.” 

HBCU Panel: “The alignment between THD’s values and the values instilled in students attending HBCUs resonated with me. As an HBCU 
alum, my experience was similar to the panelists’ experiences, i.e. earning a values-based education in addition to the academics.” 

Ken’s Krew Program: “The sheer pride that poured out of that young man and his mother literally made my day. We take for granted sometimes 
the roles we have and this was a nice reminder.” (Learn more on Page 59)

FOCUSING ON THOSE WHO SERVE

Military service members and military spouses are resilient, resourceful and team-minded. Supporting them is the right 
thing to do for our communities and our company.

Honoring those who serve or who have 
served us is fundamental to our ESG 
pillar of Strengthening our Communities. 
Our focus on the military community 
and their families includes the tens 
of thousands of veterans and military 
spouses in our workforce. Through our 
recently expanded Military Relations 
department, we look for ways to make 
The Home Depot an employer of choice 
for military members, veterans and their 
families. 

One of those veterans is Pete Capel, 
who has created a 30+ year career with 
The Home Depot. Like his father who 
served in the Navy during WWII, Pete 
joined the Marine Corps in 1983. During 
his 7-year military career maintaining 
radar systems, he was promoted to 
the rank of sergeant and was awarded 
the Navy Achievement Medal twice, 
an award that recognizes outstanding 
achievement or meritorious service 
and is recognized across all military 
branches. 

After Pete left the Marine Corps in 1990, 
he began to think about what was next 
in his life. That’s when his story with The 
Home Depot started in the most unlikely 
of ways. 

Pete was getting his hair cut when 
Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank, Home 
Depot co-founders, appeared on TV. 
As they were talking about how the 
company got started, Pete looked 
up and saw that there was a Home 
Depot store across the street. After his 
appointment ended, Pete walked over 
and immediately applied for a job. 

Pete was originally employed as a 
store sales associate in the electrical 
department. Since then, he’s held 
positions of increasing responsibility 
over his 30-year career. Today, he’s the 
vice president of field merchandising 
for the northern, southern, and western 
divisions. 

Just as Pete did more than 30 years 
ago, Richard Cranford and Aminah 
Meho recently left careers in the Army 
and Air Force, respectively, and found 
new opportunities with The Home 
Depot. Through programs like Hiring 
our Heroes, The Home Depot partners 
with organizations that support military 
members who are transitioning into a 
second career and can help veterans 
find a role they enjoy.  

Made-to-Fit Benefits 

The Home Depot offers specialized 
benefits for veterans, military service 
members and military spouses who are 
Home Depot associates:

DID YOU KNOW
The Home Depot recently enhanced its 
military discount benefit to include all 
U.S. veterans, active service members and 
military spouses every day, reaffirming the 
company’s commitment to serving the U.S. 
military community nationwide.

THE HOMER FUND

A majority of Homer Fund contributions come from associates. Every dollar our people donate helps a 
co-worker in need.

Financial Preparation
In addition to our grant and scholarship 
programs, we provide associates with 
access to a range of Homer Fund-backed 
resources to support their financial well-
being and decision making, including 
how to save for emergencies and protect 
themselves against fraud. 

Highlights

In 2021, The Homer Fund continued to 
support our people in times of need: 

•  Nearly $18.8 million was awarded 

through Homer Fund grants 

•  12 consecutive months of grant 
distributions related to natural 
disasters helped associates cope with 
a variety of challenges 

•  8,800+ associates received 

financial assistance linked to the 
pandemic, hurricanes, wildfires 
and more 

•  Associate financial assistance 
included 358 grants totaling 
$1.2 million related to COVID-19 
hardships, and 2,920 grants totaling 
$2.7 million for disaster recovery 

The Homer Fund provides financial 
assistance to associates facing 
unexpected hardships, helps associates’ 
children pay for college and supports our 
people with financial information to help 
them prepare for emergencies.

Grant Programs
•  Direct Grants help associates facing 
emergencies and tragic events, such 
as the death of a parent or child, 
natural disaster, illness or injury, 
a spouse’s layoff and more, up to 
$10,000. 

•  Matching Grants are a unique way 
The Homer Fund recognizes the 
generosity of associates toward one 
another. When associates collect 
donations for a co-worker in need, 
their money is matched by The Homer 
Fund — $2 for every $1 associates 
collect, up to $5,000 or the associate’s 
actual need. Matching Grants may be 
used for qualifying expenses that are 
ineligible for Direct Grants. They also 
may be used to complement Direct 
Grants, providing additional support 
to associates in need.

Scholarships for Associates’ 
Children
The Homer Fund’s Orange Scholars 
program offers scholarships to qualified 
children or dependents of hourly 
associates based on financial need, 
academic performance, community 
involvement and leadership. Financial 
need is the highest consideration. Since 
the Orange Scholars launch in 2006, the 
program has awarded scholarships to 
more than 15,000 recipients, totaling 
$36 million.

ASSOCIATE SAFETY

Our people are our most important assets. By focusing on workplace safety training and risk reduction, we help keep our 
associates and customers injury-free.

The Home Depot strives to provide the 
safest working and shopping environment 
for our associates and customers. A 
major component in the strategy is raising 
awareness of risks among both front-
line associates and leaders.  When our 
people are trained to recognize and correct 
hazards, our workplace is primed for 
continual improvement.

Safety Takes EveryONE

In 2021 we launched an awareness 
campaign called Safety Takes EveryONE. 
This message exemplifies that everyone, 
at all levels of the organization, must 
contribute to the safety of our associates 
and customers. 

At the individual level of the campaign, 
each associate is provided tools to avoid 
risk, with every decision made, resulting in 
everyday safety. Safety Takes EveryONE is 
our rally cry to remind associates that safety 
is their most important responsibility and 
allows us to send everyone home safely.

The leader approach to Safety Takes 
EveryONE utilizes the acronym ONE. This 
second arm of the campaign focuses of our 
leaders’ efforts to increase awareness of the 
higher-risk injury categories.  

The O is for Overexertion
Whether associates are handling product 
in a distribution center, receiving freight in 
a store, helping a customer load product 
into their vehicle or delivering bulky 
product to a jobsite, lifting too much or too 
frequently can result in injury. To prevent 
these injuries, we ask our leaders to engage 
with associates to create sustainable 
habits centered on our Lift it Close to 
Home ergonomic program. This program 
reminds individuals to minimize strain on 
their shoulders and back by anchoring the 
product lifted to their apron’s Home Depot 
logo, promoting safer lifting techniques. 

The N is for New Hire

Our focus is to ensure our newest 
associates are set up for safety success. 
Starting with their initial onboarding, we 
have simplified and prioritized safety 
training earlier in an associate’s experience 
to raise awareness around the riskiest 
tasks.  We reinforce our onboarding 
program with monthly awareness topics 
and leader-driven engagements during the 
first six months of employment to allow 
associates to ask questions and provide 
feedback to improve safety. Safety Takes 
EveryONE requires leaders to engage with 
their associates early in their career to 
establish a positive safety culture. 

The E is for Equipment

Equipment is essential to all areas of our 
business and it is paramount that it is 
operated in a safe manner.  Safety Takes 
EveryONE requires leaders to interact with 
associates through safety engagements 
focusing on the safe operations of both 
the driver and the associates working 
around the equipment.  The results of 
these engagements are reviewed and 
shared with leaders to create a continuous 
improvement model.  This heightened 
awareness drives innovation that will 
remove risk from our business and 
improve the safety within our stores and 
facilities. 

Safety is not one person’s responsibility, 
Safety Takes EveryONE to create an 
environment that fosters feedback, 
empowers our associates and leaders to 
make the safest decision, and allows every 
associate and customer to go home safely  
to their loved ones every day.

PROTECTING THE CLIMATE

CARBON FOOTPRINT

By driving efficiencies and investing in green energy, we reduced our absolute combined Scope 1 and 2 
carbon emissions by approximately 172,000 metric tons in 2021.

The Home Depot uses the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard, which has been adopted 
by numerous companies worldwide to 
calculate metric tons of greenhouse gas 
emissions and efforts to reduce them. We 
continually review and refine our emissions 
measurements to reflect changes to 
our business and improvements in data 
collection and reporting. 

We participate in the CDP® reporting 
process. CDP, formerly the Carbon 
Disclosure Project, is an independent, 
international, nonprofit organization that 
provides a global system for companies and 
cities to measure, disclose, manage and 
share environmental information. 

Our latest score of A- from CDP reflects 
our leadership and high level of action on 
climate change mitigation, adaptation and 
transparency.  

Under our science-based target goal linked 
to our annual CDP reporting, we have 
committed to reducing our Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 carbon dioxide emissions 2.1% 
per year to achieve a 40% reduction by 
2030 and a 50% reduction by 2035. 

New this year, our annual GHG emissions 
and carbon intensities correspond to 
our fiscal year results, which will also be 
disclosed in our response to the annual 
CDP Climate Change questionnaire. 
Our results include data for HD Supply 
Holdings Inc., which we acquired on 
December 24, 2020.

In 2021, we decreased our Scope 1

STORE OPERATIONS

By conserving resources we reduce business costs and our company’s impact on the environment.

Running our stores more efficiently 
furthers both our business and 
sustainability goals. In 2021, we hit 
key milestones, including a 50% 
decrease in U.S. store electricity use 
since 2010. 

When we launched our store 
electricity conservation efforts a few 
years ago, we anticipated reducing 
U.S. store electricity use 20% 
over a decade. But by tapping into 
technologies and closely tracking and 
analyzing use, we were able to save 
more electricity than we originally 
imagined. (See chart.) In 2021 alone, 
we reduced year-over-year U.S. store 
electricity use approximately 11%. 

We learned a great deal from 
the progress we made reducing 
electricity use in our stores, and 
now we are applying our experience 
and proven strategies to conserving 
resources in other areas of our 
business, including electricity use in 
our supply chain and water use in 
store irrigation. 

Our successful energy conservation 
efforts have helped us move 
closer to our goal of producing or 
procuring 100% renewable electricity 
equivalent to the electricity needs for 
all Home Depot facilities worldwide 
by 2030. 

LEDs Help Reduce Store 
Electricity Usage 

In 2021, we completed our multi-year 
project to upgrade U.S. stores to 
overhead LED lighting, retrofitting 383 
stores in 2021 alone. Now LEDs light 
up nearly all our store aisles across the 
U.S., Canada and Mexico. In the U.S., 
we have invested approximately $230 
million in total capital expenditures on 
LED upgrades since 2018. Our U.S. 
stores with LEDs consume about 30% 
less electricity than similar stores with 
conventional lighting. 

Capitalizing on Solar’s Evolution 

Harnessing power from the sun is 
essential to our renewable electricity 
aims, and we’re making progress by 
buying electricity from large-scale 
commercial solar farms. In 2021, 
Enel Green Power’s Azure Sky began 
operating in Haskell County, Texas, 
west of Dallas, providing us with 75 
megawatts of renewable electricity. We 
have agreed to purchase another 150 
megawatts from companies building 
solar farms elsewhere in Texas. Once 
operating, we expect these commercial 
solar farms, in addition to our wind farm 
projects, to provide us with enough 
electricity to power the equivalent of 
more than 500 Home Depot stores.

Making Every kWh Count
The Home Depot reduced U.S. store 
electricity consumption 50% since 2010 
through a multifaceted effort to find 
energy savings in every corner of the 
store. See our annual year-over-year 
progress below:

Rooftop Solar Harvests Renewable Energy 
Seeing the potential to use soccer-field-size space atop 
our stores to harvest the sun’s power, we installed our 
first rooftop solar farm in 2014. By the end of 2021, 
solar farms operated on 76 Home Depot stores and one 
distribution center in the U.S. In 2022, we’re increasing 
our emphasis on rooftop solar by: 

•   Increasing the amount of roof space allocated to solar     
     panels at our stores

•   Exploring possibilities for adding solar panels atop  
     more distribution facilities

Water Use Drops with Smart Irrigation

A pilot program launched in 2019 showed us the 
potential of using smart irrigation systems to save 
water at our stores. We rolled out the technology to 
164 additional stores in 2021; 503 U.S. stores were 
using smart irrigation systems by the end of the year. 
On average, there is a 29% reduction in water used 
to irrigate landscaping, compared to stores with 
traditional timer-based irrigation systems.

Here’s how it works: In-ground sensors, real-time 
weather data and other data sources guide when 
sprinklers come on and how long they operate. So, 
a store’s landscaped areas are watered according to 
plants’ needs, rather than the clock. 

CHECK IT OUT
We also help our customers harness 
the power of the sun. In partnership 
with Sunrun, we help our customers 
create clean and sustainable 
electricity. 

PROGRESS ON POWER

On average, fuel cells helped power 204 U.S. 
stores with more than 100% of their 
electricity needs annually.

At 55 U.S. stores, on-site batteries store power 
during off-peak times for use when demand spikes.

The energy capacity we purchase from the Los 
Mirasoles Wind Farm in McAllen, Texas, is enough 
wind power to run 125 Home Depot stores.

800+ U.S. stores participate in demand 
mitigation to optimize our electricity costs during 
peak demand and help local utilities better 
manage grid capacity.

SUPPLY CHAIN

By making our supply chain more efficient, we reduce business costs and the impact that our product 
distribution has on the environment.

3 ECO-FRIENDLY SUPPLY 
CHAIN INNOVATIONS

1
Added over 30 distribution centers - 
increasing speed and efficiency.

2
Moved approximately 6.9 billion 
cubic feet of products through our 
supply chain - a company record.

3
Reduced supply chain miles driven 
- despite moving record volume 
through our supply chain.

We continue to make progress on our 
multi-year supply chain initiative to create 
the fastest, most efficient and reliable 
delivery network for home improvement 
products.  

When we announced our approximately 
$1.2 billion supply chain initiative in 
2017, we could have never envisioned 
the disruption to the global supply chain 
because of the pandemic. Due to our 
supply chain investments, however, we 
have demonstrated our ability to navigate 
any environment. 

In addition, our supply chain investments 
have helped us move record amounts of 
product more efficiently. Despite seeing 
another year of record product volume 
move through our business, our new 
supply chain facilities helped us reduce 
the miles driven to get products from our 
vendors to our customers.  

Even as supply chain volume increased, 
the efficiencies we gained in our operations 
and our investments in green energy 
helped us reduce our carbon intensity.

DID YOU KNOW
We participate in the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency’s SmartWay® program 
to collect and report greenhouse gas 
emissions data from corporate supply chains. 
The Home Depot is a seven-time recipient 
of the SmartWay Excellence Award. 

WAYS WE’RE DRIVING SUPPLY CHAIN IMPROVEMENTS

In 2021, we installed hydrogen fuel cells 
at three U.S. supply chain facilities, 
giving us 15 locations with emissions-
free fuel for forklifts. We estimate 
these fuel cells helped us reduce 
electricity consumption by about 21 
million kilowatt hours in 2021.  

We do a technology-assisted 
assessment of scheduled pickups and 
deliveries, then recommend optimized 
routes to reduce miles traveled, fuel 
consumed and trucks on the road.

By partnering with suppliers to forgo 
pallets, we can stack products to the 
top of trailers, resulting in a reduction 
in the number of truckloads needed to 
transport some goods. 

As we roll out our new distribution 
facilities, we’ve partnered with Plug 
Power to fuel some of our new facility’s 
material handling fleets, like forklifts, 
with zero-emission hydrogen fuel. This 
is another way we are reducing our 
environmental impact while building a 
best-in-class supply chain.

We sell available space on our 
trucks and buy space from 
other companies, ensuring fewer 
underloaded trailers hit the road. 
That space sharing saves about 2 
million driven miles a year.

Optimization technology guides 
how we pack trucks or ocean-bound 
containers. We maximize the 
product load, reducing the number 
of truckloads and containers — 
and overall emissions.

SOURCING RESPONSIBLY

ETHICAL SOURCING

We support suppliers that take action toward maintaining our collective commitment to human rights and safety 
in our supply chain.

We owe it to our customers, associates 
and communities to further the collective 
commitment to human rights, safety and 
environmentally sound practices through 
ethical sourcing. We engage our suppliers 
in this commitment by requiring them to 
produce products in factories that adhere to 
responsible sourcing standards. We report 
on our progress in an annual Responsible 
Sourcing Report. 

Our Responsible Sourcing Standards 
mandate that suppliers and factories abide 
by all applicable international and local laws, 
rules and regulations in the manufacturing 
and distribution of merchandise or services 
provided to us. We conduct audits of 
factories around the world to ensure 
compliance with our responsible sourcing 
standards. 

Suppliers must maintain on-site 
documentation that demonstrates 
compliance with our responsible sourcing 
standards. They also must allow Home 
Depot associates and/or representatives 
full access to production facilities, worker 
records, production records and workers for 
confidential interviews in connection with 
monitoring visits. We expect our suppliers to 
promptly correct any noncompliance, starting 
with timely preparation and presentation of 
a corrective and preventative action plan. 
We also re-audit supplier facilities, with the 
frequency depending on their performance in 
prior audits.

If suppliers fail to improve, we may 
terminate our business relationships with 
them. Equally important, we support 
factories that take action to create lasting 
social and environmental compliance 
programs. We encourage suppliers and 
factory workers to communicate concerns 
via processes outlined in our corporate 
Code of Conduct.  

Our responsible sourcing audits are 
designed to assess compliance in  
these areas: 

•     Laws and regulations 
•     Child labor 
•     Forced labor 
•     Harassment and abuse 
•     Compensation 
•     Hours of work

CONFLICT MINERALS 

We work with our suppliers to ensure they implement responsible sourcing and encourage their smelters to 
obtain “conflict-free” designations.

100%of our in-scope private 

brands and proprietary-
product Tier 1 suppliers 
participated over the last 
three years in our efforts 
to collect conflict 
minerals information.

Through our due diligence process, 
which aligns with guidance from the 
Organisation for Economic Co-
Operation and Development, we 
received 100% participation from our 
in-scope private brands and proprietary-
product Tier 1 suppliers.

Sixty-two percent of our in-scope Tier 
1 suppliers indicated that one or more 
conflict minerals were necessary to the 
functionality or production of covered 
products, up from 32% in 2020. Of 
the smelters or refiners reported by 
these suppliers, only 48 out of a total 
of 311 uniquely identified smelters or 
refiners sourced conflict minerals from 
covered countries. Forty-three of these 
smelters or refiners were certified as 
DRC conflict-free by the Responsible 
Minerals Initiative, the London Bullion 
Market Association and/or the 
Responsible Jewellery Council. 

We continue to work closely with our 
suppliers to ensure they implement 
responsible sourcing; obtain current, 
accurate and complete information 
about the supply chain; and encourage 
their smelters to obtain a “conflict-free” 
designation from an independent third-
party auditor. 

Our company expects all suppliers that 
manufacture our products to provide 
appropriate information and conduct 
due diligence to enable our compliance 
with conflict minerals laws. We also 
expect these manufacturers to obtain 
products and materials from suppliers 
that are not involved in funding conflict 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(DRC) and adjoining covered countries. 
We partner with our private brands and 
proprietary product suppliers whose 
products contain tin, tungsten, tantalum 
or gold (referred to as 3TG) to identify 
the source of any of these minerals in the 
supply chain.

2021 Progress
As detailed in The Home Depot’s Conflict 
Minerals Report for the year ended Dec. 
31, 2021, our efforts focused on collecting 
and disseminating information about the 
sourcing practices of our suppliers. We 
cataloged that information in a database 
using the conflict minerals reporting 
template developed by the Responsible 
Minerals Initiative®. We report this data 
for the calendar year, rather than our 
fiscal year, in line with U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) rules.

Our in-scope Tier 1 suppliers decreased 
to 21 in 2021 from 91 in 2020 and from 
71 in 2019. In 2021, as part of our annual 
assessment of products in scope, we 
continued to exclude any supplier of 
products where the supplier merely affixed 
company brands, trademarks, logos or 
labels to generic products manufactured 
by a third party, as permitted by SEC 
guidance.

SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY

We strive to create transparency in how global forest resources are used in our products.

We continually work with stakeholders to 
promote sustainable forestry around the 
globe. Some of our current and future 
focus areas include: 

•   Continuing to avoid areas of  
     deforestation and conversion of natural  
     ecosystems in our supply chain.

•   Engaging in a multiple stakeholder  
     dialogue to develop a Canadian forest  
     procurement framework.

•   Supporting the continual dialogue  
     around the development of jurisdictional  
     landscape. We believe that this   
     approach, although complex, could  
     contain the core foundation to aligning  
     multiple stakeholders with community  
     interests, like responsible commodity  
     production, improved economic growth,  
     and human wellbeing opportunities.  
     Development of this approach has the  
     potential to promote sustained  
     community growth while protecting a  
     region’s natural resource base.

The Home Depot’s focus on selling 
products made from sustainable 
sources of wood dates to 1994, 
when certified-sustainable wood 
shelving first arrived in our aisles. We 
recognize the environmental impact 
our company can have on the world’s 
woodlands by working with suppliers 
that adhere to set standards of 
forest management and tree species 
selection. To help protect endangered 
forests and support efforts to preserve 
timber for future generations, we first 
issued our Wood Purchasing Policy in 
1999. Since then, we have continued 
to update this policy, and have worked 
to lead our suppliers to understanding 
and practicing sustainable forestry 
throughout the world.  

We know that responsible forest 
management is essential to protecting 
the health of our ecosystems, critical 
biodiversity and the more than one 
billion people who depend on forests 
for their livelihoods. The goal of our 
sustainable forestry efforts is to ensure 
timber and healthy forests remain 
available for future generations. We are 
proud of our ability to create positive 
change by encouraging sustainable 
forestry practices. We strive to better 
understand the social and economic 
effects that wood purchases have 
around the world, especially in regions 
with endangered forests.  

Over the years, we have focused 
our efforts to ensure the protection 
of forests at highest risk. While we 
sell less than 2% of the roundwood 
cut worldwide, we believe our efforts 
have had an outsized impact on the 
industry. We source approximately 
86% from North America, 
approximately 8% from South 
America, approximately 3% from Asia, 
and less than 1% from each of Europe, 
Africa, and Oceania. 

We believe that through our ongoing work 
with suppliers to sustainably manage 
forests and the commitments listed in 
our Wood Purchasing Policy, we have 
helped to expand forest land coverage 
in North America. Through the sharing of 
best practices with suppliers and ongoing 
engagement with stakeholders, we seek 
to build upon the progress we’ve made to 
protect the world’s forests.  

The positive impact of our work with 
suppliers can be seen in our results. We 
also source lumber from a number of 
the largest forestry companies in North 
America, which work with sustainable 
forest management organizations like 
Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), 
Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI), 
Programme for the Endorsement of 
Forest Certification (PEFC), and American 
Tree Farm to ensure their trees are being 
sourced sustainably. 

®

Suppliers of ours like Mendocino 
Redwood Company (MRC  ) and 
Humboldt Redwood Company 
(HRC™) seek to be examples of forest 
restoration and show how private forest 
management can protect and restore the 
ecological attributes of the forest, and 
whose forestlands are certified by the 
Forest Stewardship Council   (FSC) as 
being well-managed forests.  

®

While we are proud of the progress 
we have made to promote sustainable 
forestry, we continue to assess 
opportunities to drive progress in 
this area.

Data-Driven Sourcing 
Understanding the world’s forest coverage by country 
helps guide our supply chain decisions. The vast 
majority of our wood product purchases originate from 
North America. 

Seventeen percent of the world’s forests are in Canada 
and the United States, according to research by the 
United Nations Food & Agriculture Organization. The 
U.N.’s 2020 State of the World’s Forests report shows 
that more than half of the world’s forest coverage is in 
five countries: Russia (20%), Brazil (12%), Canada (9%), 
the U.S. (8%) and China (5%).

The Home Depot’s Wood Purchasing Policy 
outlines our commitment to:

•  Give preference to the purchase of wood and wood 
products originating from certified, well-managed 
forests wherever feasible.

•  Eliminate the purchase of wood and wood products 

from forest regions identified as endangered.

•  Practice and promote the efficient and responsible 

use of wood and wood products.

•  Promote and support the development and use of 

alternative environmental products.

•  Not accept wood products from the Amazon or 

Congo Basin areas, Papua New Guinea or the 
Solomon Islands, unless they’re Forest Stewardship 
Council (FSC)-certified. 

•  Demand that our vendors and their suppliers of 

wood and wood products maintain compliance with 
laws and regulations pertaining to their operations 
and the products they manufacture.

REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

GREENER PRODUCTS

Our greatest environmental impact comes from the products we sell, and our biggest opportunity to create 
change is helping customers live more sustainably. 

Eco Options 

Eco Actions 

The Home Depot’s Eco Options 
program continues to help our 
customers identify products that have 
less of an impact on the environment 
and encourages our suppliers to 
provide more sustainable offerings.  

We launched Eco Options in 2007 in 
partnership with SCS Global Services, 
a leading, independent, third-party 
certification body that validates 
environmental claims. 

For a product to receive Eco Options 
classification, the supplier must 
document attributes that prove it has 
less of an impact on the environment 
than comparable products in the same 
category. Until all industries create 
and abide by a reporting formula that 
measures product attributes according 
to a common sustainability standard, 
we will continue to use our Eco 
Options program to help customers 
sort through green product claims. 

We continue to look for ways to help our 
customers reduce their environmental 
impact through the projects they take 
on. Building on the progress we’ve made 
with our Eco Options program, in April 
2021 we launched our new Eco Actions 
program, which provides our customers 
with the resources they need to take 
individual action on environmental 
issues. 

Our Eco Actions website provides 
customers with new content, insights 
and ideas from innovative partners to 
inspire sustainable action. Eco Action’s 
growing library of sustainable-DIY 
content includes:   

•    Reducing emissions with battery- 
      powered outdoor equipment 

•    Installing a water-conserving  
      shower faucet 

•    Reducing waste through our tool  
      repair services 

•    Highlighting responsibly sourced    
      wood products 

•    Benefits of organic gardening 

Eco Actions is just another way we’re 
helping our customers make sustainable 
changes for the better by helping them

Focus on Forestry and  
Responsible Chemistry 

In addition to our Eco Options and 
Eco Actions programs, we focus our 
sustainable product efforts in two key 
areas relevant to our business: forestry 
and indoor air quality.   

In 1999, we established a Wood 
Purchasing Policy to help avoid wood 
products coming from forestland with 
a high conservation value. Since then, 
we have continued to update this policy, 
and have worked to lead our suppliers 
to understanding and practicing 
sustainable forestry throughout the 
world.   

And in 2017, we published our Chemical 
Strategy (see Page 46) to encourage 
the exclusion of certain chemicals from 
paint, flooring, insulation, household 
cleaning and paint removers. Our 
chemical strategy is an important part 
of our commitment to offer greener 
products.

REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

CIRCULARITY
CIRCULARITY

The Home Depot works to help the industry change the way it thinks about materials. We encourage supplier innovation 
in product and packaging design, material selection and manufacturing, as well as striving to produce products that have 
positive environmental impact during use. 

Since we introduced Circularity as one 
of our Eco Options’ pillars in 2019, our 
focus has been to prevent products 
and packaging from becoming waste 
throughout the product lifecycle. The 
foundation of Circularity comes from 
nature: nothing is wasted, and everything 
is regenerative. 

We strive to offer products with a 
positive environmental impact, and we 
encourage suppliers to innovate in how 
they produce and package products for 
reuse and longevity. We carry millions of  
products, and many have the potential to 
move our economy toward circularity. 

We also look for opportunities within 
Home Depot operations to reduce, 
repair, reuse and recycle. The goal is to 
extend our planet’s natural resources and 
protect land and water from the impact 
of material disposal.

3 WAYS THE HOME 
DEPOT SUPPORTS 
CIRCULARITY

1

RECYCLE by separating and 
collecting raw materials from 
our own waste streams, and 
working with our suppliers to 
turn them into new products.

2 REPAIR items in our stores 
and for our customers to extend 
the life of products and avoid 
the energy emissions from 
manufacturing replacements.

3 REUSE materials so less  
waste goes into landfills.

Along with our suppliers and vendors, we are 
developing our thinking and capabilities in an 
effort to: 

•   Design with the environment in mind 

•   Eliminate excess material 

•   Eliminate materials that are not readily       
     reusable or recyclable 

•   Minimize mixed materials to enable   
     simpler disassembly and recycling 

•   Utilize materials that are biodegradable or      
     readily recyclable 

•   Utilize recycled content, when possible,  
     without compromising product efficacy 

•   Facilitate the reuse of material indefinitely 

•   Promote minimization of environmental     
     impact in manufacturing and  
     consumer use

REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

RESPONSIBLE CHEMISTRY

We’re addressing chemicals of concerns in our products and providing transparency into our approach in our 
regularly updated Chemical Strategy.

Vinyl 

The Home Depot vinyl flooring suppliers 
are setting the pace for change in this 
category with efforts to continually 
improve the chemical profile of their 
products. As of January 2016, no 
ortho-phthalates are permitted as added 
plasticizers in vinyl flooring sold in  
Home Depot stores in the U.S. and 
Canada. 

Laminate Flooring 

Laminate flooring in Home Depot stores 
is verified by either GREENGUARD Gold 
or FloorScore® certification to contain 
0.0073 ppm or less of formaldehyde, 
which is a stricter standard than CARB 2 
of 0.05 ppm.

At The Home Depot, we recognize 
the opportunity we have for the 
environmental impact of our 
organization, and that our biggest 
impact is the products we sell. 
In partnership with stakeholders 
throughout the supply chain, we are 
committed to offering products that 
are safer for the environment and our 
customers. 

With our encouragement, our suppliers 
have been investing in developing 
environmentally innovative products. 
The Home Depot supports the work of 
the Green Chemistry & Commerce 
Council (GC3) through annual 
membership and participation in the 
Retail Leadership Council of the GC3, 
and we participated in developing the 
GC3’s Joint Statement on using Green 
Chemistry and Safer Alternatives to 
Advance Sustainable Products. 

We and many of our suppliers also 
partner with respected third-party 
certification organizations and 
environmental non-profits that guide 
the home improvement industry toward 
safer chemical ingredient use. The 
Home Depot is committed to continuing 
the drive toward minimizing the 
environmental impact of the products 
we sell.

OUR COMMITMENT
•   The Home Depot is committed to     
     increasing our assortment of   
     products that maintain third- 
     party certifications of their chemical  
     ingredients, and that meet high  
     environmental standards.

•   The Home Depot works with many  
     suppliers in efforts to improve  
     chemicals in categories with the  
     greatest potential impact on indoor  
     air quality.

•   We encourage our suppliers to  
     continually review key categories  
     to track progress on environmental  
     innovations in green chemistry. 

The Home Depot will evaluate this 
strategy annually to ensure our 
approach, goals and disclosure are 
appropriate and meet the needs of our 
stakeholders.

FLOORING

Carpet 

The Home Depot’s carpet suppliers have 
been at the forefront of the industry-
wide removal of chemicals of concern 
and the exploration of safer alternatives. 
All indoor wall-to-wall carpet sold 
through The Home Depot U.S. and 
Canada has a third-party verification of 
transparency through DECLARE® Label 
or Environmental Product Declarations 
(EPDs), or certification of material health 
through Cradle to Cradle™ Products 
Innovation Institute or CRI Green Label 
Plus®. The following chemicals of 
concern are excluded from indoor wall-
to-wall carpet in our U.S. and Canada 
stores: 

•   Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or  
     perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) 
•   Triclosan 
•   Organotins

RESIDENTIAL HOUSEHOLD 
CLEANING CHEMICALS
The Home Depot continues to work 
with suppliers to improve products 
that impact indoor air quality. As a 
result, we are asking our suppliers to 
exclude the following chemicals from 
the manufacturing of all residential 
household cleaning chemical products 
sold in Home Depot stores by the end 
of 2022:  

•   Propyl-paraben  
•   Butyl-paraben  
•   Diethyl phthalates  
•   Dibutyl phthalates  
•   Formaldehyde (Added) 
•   Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs)  
•   Triclosan  
•   Toluene  
•   Trichloroethylene (TCE)  

In addition, our Eco Options program 
identifies environmentally preferred 
products, including cleaners that have 
obtained certifications from independent 
third-party testers such as EPA’s Safer 
Choice and Cradle to Cradle. 

INSULATION
Our fiberglass insulation suppliers have 
persistently challenged themselves to 
remove certain chemicals of concern 
from their products over the last decade. 
As a result, 100% of our fiberglass 
insulation products in the U.S. and 
Canada are GREENGUARD Gold 
certified and do not contain the following 
chemicals of concern: 

•   Brominated flame retardants 
•   Halogenated flame retardants 
•   Antimony trioxide 
•   Formaldehyde 
•   Added heavy metals

GARDENING
Organic gardening has grown from niche 
to mainstream, and The Home Depot 
has expanded its organic gardening 
products to offer multiple brands of 
soils, fertilizers, and weed and pest 
control products to meet our customers’ 
changing needs. In 2016 we launched 

local, organic vegetables and herbs. We 
expanded the program in 2017 to half 
our U.S. stores and have committed 
to continue to expand our organics 
assortment. 

We also committed at the end of 2018 
to no longer treat plants in our garden 
centers with neonicotinoids, except 
where mandated by state law.

The Home Depot is committed 
to working with suppliers and 
the EPA to identify alternatives 
with comparable efficacy. 
The Home Depot phased out 
methylene chloride and N-methyl-
2-pyrrolidone (NMP) from paint 
removal products at the end 
of 2018.

PAINTING PRODUCTS

Paints 
Our paint suppliers have taken efforts 
over the last ten years to evolve their 
paints and offer products that help 
maintain air quality. The following 
chemicals of concern are excluded from 
our interior and exterior latex water-
based wall paints in our U.S. and Canada 
stores: 

•   Triclosan 
•   Isocyanates 
•   Formaldehyde 
•   Lead/heavy metals 
•   Alkylphenol ethoxylates and 
     Nonylphenol ethoxylates (APEOs 
     and NPEs) 

Certifications: In our U.S. stores, all 
Behr® interior paints, Glidden® Premium, 
Glidden Diamond™ and PPG® Timeless® 
interior paints are GREENGUARD Gold 
certified.  

Paint-tinting Colorants: In 2012, we 
transitioned our paint-tinting colorants 
in our U.S. and Canada stores from 
solvent-based formulation to a water-
based, low-VOC and ethylene-glycol-free 
formulation. 

Volatile Organic Compounds: All of our 
interior and exterior latex water-based 
wall paints in our U.S. and Canada stores 
are zero or low VOC. 

Paint Removers  

Removing paints and varnishes safely 
and efficiently is an important step in 
many home improvement painting and 
staining projects. Methylene chloride 
has historically been the most effective 
product option in this category.  

Our current U.S. and 
Canada zero- and low-VOC 
paints are outlined here:

ENERGY-SAVING PRODUCTS

Customers who use our energy-saving products reduce their power bills and their impact on the planet.

The Home Depot encourages suppliers to make 
the products we sell more energy efficient, and our 
partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency’s Energy Star® program supports those 
efforts, too. 

In 2021, we helped our customers save $1.5 billion 
on utility bills through the purchase and proper use 
of energy-efficient products. Energy Star-labeled 
products were key to that progress. In 2021, we 
offered over 22,000 energy-saving products in 
stores and online, including more than 15,000 
Energy Star products. We sold more than 200 
million units of Energy Star products.   

We estimate our customers’ purchases of Energy 
Star products in 2021 helped reduce annual 
electricity use by 7 billion kilowatt hours, saving 
$950 million on energy costs and lowering carbon 
emissions by 4.9 million metric tons. 

DID YOU KNOW
The Home Depot U.S. is a 12-time Energy Star 
award winner and our Canadian stores were 
recognized for the eighth year in a row as the 
ENERGY STAR Canada Retailer of the Year in 
2021. See how our Canadian division is improving 
sustainability on Page 71.

GOING GREEN, SAVING GREEN

Energy Star-labeled clothes dryers use 20% less electricity. If 
all clothes dryers sold in the U.S. were Energy Star certified, 
Americans could collectively save more than $1.5 billion each 
year in utility costs and prevent greenhouse gas emissions 
equivalent to those from more than 2 million vehicles. 

Clothes washers use 
about 25% less energy 
and 33% less water 
when they’re Energy 
Star-certified.

WATER-SAVING PRODUCTS

The Home Depot helps protect water resources nationwide by selling products designed to conserve.

In alignment with the U.N. Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG) to ensure 
availability and sustainable management 
of water and sanitation for all, we 
work with suppliers to encourage 
the production of water-conserving 
products, which we, in turn, offer to our 
customers. Our greatest opportunity 
to effect environmental change for the 
better is by selling eco-friendly products 
that help drive efficient use of resources 
in communities we serve. 

In 2021, we continued to help our 
customers conserve water in their homes 
and businesses. Across our stores and 
online, we offered more than 8,000 water-
saving products, including more than 5,000 
products bearing the EPA’s WaterSense 
label, and we sold nearly 21 million units of 
those WaterSense products.   

We estimate our customers’ purchases 
of WaterSense products in 2021 helped 
reduce annual water consumption by over 
66 billion gallons, which would collectively 
mean savings of more than $873 million on 
water bills.  

The EPA estimates that household 
leaks can add up to nearly 1 trillion 
gallons of water lost every year. 
Fixing these leaks conserves water 
and can also reduce utility bills by 
about 10%. We provide project 
guides on our Eco Actions website 
to help educate customers on fixing 
or replacing leaky faucets.  

DID YOU KNOW
Our company has been a 
WaterSense Partner of the Year 
eight times since 2011, receiving 
the Sustained Excellence 
awards in three of those years. 

GOING GREEN, SAVING GREEN

The average family in 
the U.S. could save 
2,700 gallons of water 
per year by installing 
WaterSense-labeled 
showerheads. 

Replacing old, inefficient 
faucets and aerators with 
WaterSense-labeled models 
can save the average family 
700 gallons of water per 
year, equal to the amount 
of water needed to take 
45 showers. 

Toilets account for nearly 
30% of an average home’s 
water use. Replacing old 
toilets with WaterSense 
models can save nearly 
13,000 gallons a year.

GARDENING

Our partnerships with local growers enable us to offer healthy, environmentally beneficial plants, 
reduce emissions and support businesses in the communities we serve.

Native Plants 

Our growers work closely with U.S. states’ 
departments of agriculture to identify 
invasive plants that may threaten local 
native plants.  

Supporting Local Growers 

We are proud to partner with more than 
135 plant growers who balance the 
impact of their production with local 
environmental issues and growing 
conditions in their regions.   

The Home Depot partners with our growers 
and suppliers in advance of each growing 
season to offer healthy trees, blooms and 
edible plants that support local environments 
and pollinators. Our gardening product 
offerings are informed by our understanding 
that backyards, balconies and patios are 
well-being retreats for our customers and 
mini-ecosystems that have an impact on 
their surroundings. 

Growing Organic 

We offer more than 40 varieties of organic, 
non-GMO vegetable and herb plants grown 
according to methods approved by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) National 
Organic Program. Only products that have 
been certified as meeting the USDA’s 
organic production and handling standards 
may carry the USDA Organic seal.

REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

WASTE MANAGEMENT  
& RECYCLING

We’re committed to properly managing waste. We partner with vendors to keep improving how we and our 
customers reduce, reuse and recycle.

Hazardous Materials Disposal  
& Handling
We seek sustainable methods of disposal, 
and, in 2021, our company recycled or 
reused for energy 30% of the hazardous 
waste generated from our operations and 
customer returns. We properly disposed of 
the remaining waste. 

Associate Training & Resources 

Associates receive training on recognizing 
hazardous materials. Associates 
responsible for managing storage and 
cleanup of hazardous  
materials complete additional in-depth 
environmental compliance training.  

Information about and guidance for the 
cleanup, classification, labeling and 
storage of hazardous waste is available 
to associates through company-issued 
handheld devices and our associate 
intranet site.

Preventative Actions 

Responsive Actions 

We take specific steps to avoid spills 
and contamination across the store with 
particular focus on these areas:  

If a spill does occur, we have the 
following resources in place to 
properly address it: 

Spill kits and containers—Located 
throughout each store for prompt 
and effective cleanup and disposal 
of hazardous materials such as paint, 
solvents, aerosols, oil, fuel, pesticides 
and fertilizers 

Emergency response—A third-party 
consultant provides an emergency 
response team available 24/7 to assist 
with hazardous materials cleanup 
and, if necessary, provide remediation 
services

Garden center—Proper handling of 
fertilizer and pesticides bags, including 
checking for and properly repairing 
damaged bags 

Receiving and central storage—
Appropriate procedures for handling, 
accumulating, storing, labeling and 
inventorying hazardous waste and 
separating potentially incompatible 
materials 

Inspections of key areas—Routine 
inspections of garden areas, parking lots 
and store entrances identify potential 
problems; scheduled sweeps of fertilizer 
aisles and parking lots help protect 
against hazardous materials entering the 
environment

REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING

Our packaging innovations reduce waste, increase shipping efficiency and decrease product damage. That’s good 
for the planet and our business.

The Home Depot’s packaging team works 
with our private-label product suppliers to 
apply science to creating better packaging. 
Our goal is to reduce package footprints and 
use more sustainable materials to secure 
and protect the private-label products we 
sell. From 2017 through 2021, our packaging 
innovations allowed us to redesign 652 
packages to reduce size and materials.

In 2021, our packaging team continued to 
innovate as they undertook a large project 
aimed at reducing packaging across our 
Crown Bolt products, Home Depot’s private 
brand of fasteners and building hardware. 
This project touched over 16 million 
packaging units, across nearly 300 SKUs. 

Using Less EPS & PVC 

In 2021, our packaging team continued 
to find substitutes for expanded 
polystyrene (EPS) foam and polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) film in our private-label 
products. EPS foam is good at protecting 
products from damage, but it contains 
beads of chemicals and oil that are 
often difficult to recycle and can take 
more than a century to biodegrade. We 
continue to look across our private-
label products to find even the smallest 
amounts of EPS and replace it with 
easier-to-recycle materials like molded 
pulp and paper. 

PVC film is a thin, rigid synthetic plastic 
polymer that’s molded around products 
to secure and protect them. But, like 
EPS, it is tough to recycle and takes a 
long time to break down naturally, and 
we’re working hard to use less of it. 

In 2020, we committed to eliminating 
EPS foam and PVC film from our private-
label packages by 2023, prompting us to 
dig even deeper for results.

2021 BY THE 
NUMBERS

286
packages
were redesigned to 
reduce size 
and materials

274,600
cubic feet
of EPS foam was 
removed from our private-
label packaging— enough 
to fill 138 school buses

1,119,700
square feet
of PVC film was 
eliminated— enough to 
cover 19 football fields

CHECK IT OUT
We’re compressing EPS waste from our operations 
into foam blocks that can be repurposed into new 
products, such as insulation — keeping the material 
out of landfills. Meet the entrepreneurial associate 
who launched this initiative.

SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING

Our practice of engaging with our stakeholders on ESG topics helped us design a more sustainable packaging solution for some of 
our LED lightbulbs. In response to customer feedback, we have sought to remove the excess plastic from our ECOSMART   LED 
bulb packaging. In this regard, our packaging team went to work looking for a new way to package the bulbs without the need for 
plastic. The redesign that our packaging team came up with helped eliminate the need for plastic in the packaging, while 
also reducing the size of the box.

®

Redesigned packaging 
helped remove more than 

133,000

pounds of plastic

Paper packaging protects as 
well as molded plastic but is 
recyclable
and requires 
less space

The new design also reduced 
the packaging size by 

more than 20%

decreasing shipping space 
required, and lowering 
transportation emissions

HBCU Legacy Bowl

James “Shack” Harris and Doug Williams, co-founders of the Black 
College Football Hall of Fame, wanted to address a major issue: 
Football players from historically Black colleges and universities 
(HBCUs) were not being drafted by NFL teams. Thus, they created 
the HBCU Legacy Bowl, a post-season all-star game showcasing 
some of the best draft-eligible football players attending historically 
black colleges and universities. The event is more than a football 
game. The Legacy Bowl’s career fair brings job opportunities and 
professional skills training like résumé writing and interview tips to 
juniors and seniors attending HBCUs. 

Habitat for Humanity
The Home Depot Foundation has partnered with 
Habitat for Humanity since 2012 to help revitalize 
neighborhoods across America through affordable 
homeownership that helps build generational wealth. In 
March 2021, The Home Depot announced our Bring on

than $200,000 in products to Habitat for Humanity 
organizations across the country to support local DIY 
projects and neighborhood revitalization efforts.

SUPPLIER  DIVERSITY

Doing business with a diverse group of suppliers provides us with unique ideas, different perspectives 
and innovative products that meet the needs of our customers.

At the Home Depot, we are committed to building inclusive 
and sustainable business opportunities for women, 
minority, veteran, disability and LGBTQ owned companies. 
Our Supplier Diversity program was established in 2003, 
with the goal of increasing shareholder value, driving 
innovation and creating positive impact in the communities 
we serve. We celebrate and invest in minority entrepreneurs 
because we understand their critical role in driving 
innovation, creating jobs and meaningful solutions in our 
communities. In 2021, we spent $3.3 billion with diverse 
suppliers, compared to $3.2 billion the previous year.  

Diverse businesses are identified as U.S.-based, for-profit 
and 51% or more owned, controlled and operated by U.S. 
citizens or people with U.S. permanent resident alien status 
that fall under one of the following categories: woman, 
ethnic minority, veteran, LGBTQ, individuals with a 
disability. 

In 2021, we launched a Tier II supplier diversity program 
designed to drive more spending from our direct Tier I 
suppliers to diverse businesses. We’re working to better 
ensure that a portion of the money we spend on products 
and services, even with suppliers that are not identified as 
diverse, makes its way to diverse enterprises. The Home 
Depot provides supplier development programs and 
mentoring to assist diverse suppliers with business growth, 
and we partner with organizations that provide certification, 
education and opportunities for capital and networking.

RETOOL YOUR SCHOOL

Since 2009, our campus improvement grant program has helped fund more than 100 projects benefiting 65% of the 
nation’s HBCUs. 

In 2021, The Home Depot’s Retool 
Your School campus improvement 
grant program marked its 12th year 
of commitment to historically Black 
colleges and universities (HBCUs) and 
the pivotal role they play in our higher 
education system.  

Every year, HBCU students, alumni 
and advocates vote for their schools 
to become Retool Your School grant 
recipients. Voting is organized around 
three school clusters, based on student 
population, and 10 schools with the 
highest votes per cluster are awarded a 
grant. In 2021, 62 HBCUs competed.  

 Since the program’s launch, more than 
38 million votes have been cast in 
support of HBCUs vying for Retool Your 
School grants.

We are committed to furthering our

TEAM DEPOT

Together with The Home Depot Foundation, Team Depot improves the homes and lives of veterans and helps 
communities affected by natural disasters.

Team Depot, The Home Depot’s 
associate volunteer force, continued 
to support communities and veterans 
in need throughout 2021 despite 
ongoing COVID-related challenges. 
While adhering to CDC and government 
safety guidelines, our orange-blooded 
associates again rose to the challenges 
that many of our communities 
experienced throughout the year. 
Team Depot volunteers responded to 
numerous natural disasters including 
tornadoes, hurricanes and wildfires. In 
addition, they provided life-changing 
support to veterans across the country.   

The Home Depot has helped 
communities for many years prepare 
and recover from the devastating 
impacts caused by hurricanes, and this 
year was no different. In anticipation 
of the 2021 hurricane season, Team 
Depot, alongside our nonprofit partner 
Operation Blessing, packaged nearly 
800 relief kits. These kits provided 
essential supplies to communities as 
they experienced the third most active 
hurricane season on record.   

Following Hurricane Ida, the second-
most damaging hurricane ever to make 
landfall in Louisiana, The Home Depot 
Foundation and Team Depot volunteers 
stepped into action. The Home Depot 
Foundation committed up to $1 million to 
support immediate disaster relief in the 
communities that were impacted. Team 
Depot volunteers from Courthouse, Ohio,  
gathered supplies and loaded materials 
including generators, box fans, and more, 
to be shipped nearly 900 miles away to 
the Children’s Hospital New Orleans. 
Volunteers in Texas, Georgia and Alabama 
also worked to assemble thousands of 
disaster relief kits, which included items 
like cleaning supplies, N95 masks, hand 
sanitizer and other recovery essentials 
(Learn more here).   

In the days following the devastating 
Marshall Fire in Boulder, Colorado, the 
most destructive fire in the state’s history, 
Team Depot built and distributed over 600 
sifters and donated personal protective 
equipment (PPE) to assist families who 
lost their homes. They also donated water 
and other supplies to local shelters and 
first responders.   

As pandemic restrictions eased, our 
associates were eager to return to 
serving our communities. During 
National Volunteer Month in April, 
Team Depot volunteers participated 
in nearly 100 service projects across 
the country.   

On Veterans Day of 2021, The 
Home Depot Foundation kicked-
off its annual Operation Surprise 
campaign. Team Depot volunteers 
helped The Home Depot Foundation 
provide life-changing moments of 
surprise and support for veterans 
and communities in need. During 
our 2021 campaign, approximately 
14,000 Team Depot associates 
completed more than 160 projects 
across 150 cities in partnership with 
more than 140 nonprofit partners.

THE HOME DEPOT
FOUNDATION

The Foundation works to improve the homes and lives of U.S. veterans, support communities affected by natural 
disasters and train skilled tradespeople to fill the labor gap.

Support for Veterans 

In 2021, The Home Depot Foundation, 
a 501(c)3 public charity, was proud to 
achieve the milestone of ten years of its 
formal financial commitment to support the 
U.S. military veteran community, while also 
surpassing $400 million invested in support 
of our veterans. These achievements are 
part of the Foundation’s larger commitment 
to invest $500 million in veteran causes by 
2025. 

Giving back to veterans is part of The 
Home Depot’s culture and aligns with 
our core values. With tens of thousands 
veterans and military spouses in our 
workforce, we are focused on helping 
support the brave men and women who 
served our country, both in our stores and 
in our communities (see Page 30).  

For the past decade, the Foundation has 
focused on ending veteran homelessness, 
improving veteran housing through critical 
home repairs; and building accessible 
smart homes for catastrophically combat-
wounded veterans. In 2021, the Foundation 
surpassed more than $100 million invested 
to help address the issue of veteran 
homelessness at the national and local 

level. The Foundation committed $600,000 
to support housing facilities in Phoenix, 
Arizona, and Riverside California, two of 
numerous grants awarded to nonprofits 
working to end veteran homelessness. 

Phoenix, Arizona 

•  Invested $300,000 to provide housing  
    and access to critical supportive services   
    for more than 180 homeless and at-risk  
    veterans, in partnership with U.S.VETS.  

Riverside, California 

•  Granted $300,000 to U.S.VETS-Inland    
    Empire to support the construction of  
    a new housing facility that will serve 60  
    homeless and at-risk veterans.  

Both of these new housing facilities will also 
provide veterans with access to counseling, 
treatment and other services vital to help 
veterans transition to civilian life. 

Since 2011, The Foundation and its national 
nonprofit partners have built, renovated, and 
enhanced more than 50,000 veteran homes 
and facilities. Learn more here. 

Disaster Response  

In 2021, The Home Depot Foundation 
committed more than $7 million 
to help communities impacted by 
winter storms, fires, tornadoes, and 
hurricanes.  

We are committed to providing our 
associates and communities with 
immediate support following natural 
disasters, and 2021 was no different. 
The Foundation, along with Team 
Depot volunteers, stepped up to help 
throughout the year.   

In February, responding to the winter 
storms that impacted most of the 
U.S. and left millions without power, 
the Foundation committed up to 
$500,000, plus sent generators and 
other essential supplies to those most 
impacted. 

The Foundation also committed up to 
$1 million to support the communities 
impacted by the devastating tornado 
outbreak across the central United 
States in December.

In 2021, the Foundation announced a 
new Path to Pro scholarship program 
that will grant $250,000 in financial 
assistance to high school seniors

Foundation, a registered 
501(c)3 public nonprofit, 
is partnering with leading 
construction trade 
organizations to prepare 
people for a career in the 
skilled trades.

Path to Pro 

The Home Depot Foundation’s skilled 
trades training program, Path to Pro, 
launched in 2018 with a $50 million 
commitment to train the next generation 
of skilled tradespeople, diversify the 
trades industry, and address the 
growing labor shortage in the U.S. 
The Foundation’s trades-focused 
partnerships have introduced more than 
15,000 people to the skilled trades and 
have trained more than 5,000 participants 
through programming available to youth, 
high school students, underserved 
communities and separating 
U.S. military. 

Military Program 

The Path to Pro military program is 
currently offered on 10 U.S. military 
bases and provides exiting service 
members access to a free, 12-week 
program that provides industry-
recognized PACT and OSHA 10 
certifications. During the 2021 Operation 
Surprise campaign, the Foundation 
granted each of the Path to Pro military 
bases’ programs $10,000 to surprise a 
local Habitat for Humanity veteran family, 
just in time for the holidays. 

Youth Program 

The Foundation aims to address the gap 
in the skilled trades by training the next 
generation of skilled trades people. In 
partnership with Home Builders Institute, 
the Path to Pro high school program 
offers pre-apprenticeship certification 
(PACT) curriculum and hands-on 
experience to 11th and 12th grade 
students in more than 250 schools across 
30 states. The Foundation also partners 
with Construction Ready (formerly 
CEFGA) to provide K-12 trades training 
programs in Georgia.

UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE  
DEVELOPMENT GOALS

The U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for action to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice and protect 
our planet. The plan, outlined in 2015, focuses on 17 areas in which nations, governments, businesses and citizens can work to 
achieve measurable results by 2030. The Home Depot shares many of the same goals, which are articulated in our  
core values. Eleven SDGs align with our sphere of influence.

Good Health and Well-Being
•  We transitioned our COVID-related enhanced 
associate pay and benefits to permanent 
compensation enhancements for front-line, hourly 
associates. (Page 25)

•  We offer a range of healthy-life benefits at no cost to 

associates. (Page 28)

•  The Home Depot’s Eco Options/Eco Actions program 

identifies environmentally preferred products.  
(Page 42)

Gender Equality
•  We strive for a fair workplace that removes 

bias and provides women and associates from 
underrepresented minority groups access to resources 
they need to succeed at work. (Page 19)

•  Our Women’s Link associate resource group promotes 

professional development for women associates 
across our organization. (Page 26)

associates who are having a baby, adopting, or 
fostering a child. This benefit is available to both 
mothers and fathers. Birth mothers are eligible for an 
additional six-week paid maternity benefit. (Page 28)

Clean Water and Sanitation
•  In U.S. stores, we offer bathroom vanity faucets and 
toilets for sale that bear the U.S. EPA’s WaterSense 
label. Our store-merchandised showerheads are 
more efficient than the WaterSense standard. 
(Page 49)

•  We estimate that our customers saved over 66 

billion gallons of water in 2021 by properly using our 
water-saving products. (Page 49)

•  In 2021, we had smart irrigation systems at 503 U.S. 
stores. On average, there is an approximately 29% 
reduction in water used, compared to traditional 
systems. (Page 36)

Affordable and Clean Energy
•  At the end of fiscal year 2021, we were operating 

rooftop solar farms atop 76 U.S. stores and 
leveraging fuel cell-generated power at 205 U.S. 
stores. (Page 36)

•  Through our expanded wind and solar farm 

partnerships, we expect to purchase enough 
electricity to power the equivalent of more than 
500 Home Depot stores. (Page 35)

•  Our partnership with the EPA’s Energy Star program 
in 2021 enabled customers to purchase products 
capable of reducing their electricity use by 7 billion 
kilowatt hours, saving $950 million on energy costs.

CODE OF CONDUCT

Doing the right thing is embedded in our culture. That applies to how we serve customers, give back to communities, 
support our people and conduct our business.

Our Business Code of Conduct 
and Ethics provides straightforward 
information about The Home Depot’s 
operating principles and offers tools 
to help associates make decisions 
that align with our ethical and legal 
obligations. The code applies to 
associates worldwide, and the company 
expects them to comply with the 
code and with all applicable laws and 
regulations in countries in which we do 
business. In particular, the code outlines 
The Home Depot’s ethical and legal 
standards in these areas:

•  Safety

•  Labor and employment

•  Conflicts of interest

•  Antitrust and fair competition

•  Confidentiality, privacy and  

information protection

•  Protecting the company’s assets and 

intellectual property

• 

Insider trading

•  Financial integrity and reporting

•  Records retention

•  Environmental responsibility

•  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

(FCPA) and anti-bribery compliance

•  Political activity

•  Government Contracting

We empower associates to speak up 
when our ethical standards are not 
being met. We encourage them to voice 
concerns, express doubts, discuss 
problems and ask questions. In addition 
to sharing concerns with any member 
of their management team or a human 
resources partner, associates can 
report ethical or legal concerns to our 
Associate AwareLine, a 24/7 hotline. 
Reports can be made via thdawareline.
com or through a live operator available 
in local languages. Associates may 
remain anonymous when reporting 
concerns.

Associate AwareLine 
1-800-286-4909

Reports are handled using a case 
management system. We have a 
longstanding policy that prohibits 
retaliation for making a report. 

We also provide ways for suppliers, 
vendors, service providers and their 
workers to report concerns when 
they think our Home Depot values 
or compliance with the law may be 
compromised. Workers in countries 
from which we source goods may 
submit anonymous reports via 
thdsupplieralertline.com. In addition, 
our Supplier AlertLine is answered by a 
live operator 24/7 in these countries:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

We understand our responsibility to behave ethically, to understand the impact we have on people and communities, 
and to fairly consider the interests of a broad base of stakeholders.

LEARN MORE
Our proxy statement 
offers more details about 
corporate governance and 
risk management. Go to 
our Corporate Governance 
Overview for additional 
information on our corporate 
governance practices. 

The Home Depot has a long-standing 
commitment to strong corporate 
governance, which promotes the long-
term interests of shareholders, strengthens 
Board and management accountability, 
and helps build public trust in the 
company. 

Our Board of Directors has adopted 
policies and processes that foster effective 
Board oversight of critical matters such as 
strategy, risk management, financial and 
other controls, compliance, culture, ESG,  
and management succession planning.

At least once a year, our Board discusses 
our sustainability strategy and activities, 
including this report.

Leadership Structure 

On at least an annual basis, the Board 
assesses its leadership structure, 
including the appointment of the Chair of 
the Board. Our Lead Director is annually 
elected by the independent members of 
the Board. For the past several years, 
having a combined chairman and CEO, 
an independent Lead Director, and 
Board committees composed entirely of 
independent directors, together with other 
robust corporate governance practices, 
has provided strong independent 
oversight of management while ensuring 
clear strategic alignment throughout the 
company. 

In early 2022, in connection with our 
CEO succession process, the Board split 
the CEO and Chair roles to support the 
leadership transition. Our former CEO, 
Craig Menear, remained as Board Chair 
following the appointment of Ted Decker 
as CEO and President. The independent 
members of the Board will continue to 
assess the Board leadership structure over 
time and determine what best supports the 
company’s needs.  

Our corporate governance 
policies reflect best practices:

Shareholder Protections
•  Annual election of directors with 

majority voting standard in uncontested 
director elections 

•  Shareholder ability to call special 

meetings and act by written consent

•  A market standard shareholder right of 

proxy access 

• 

Independent Lead Director 

•  Approximately 86% of directors and 
all Board committee members are 
independent 

•  Director mandatory retirement age  

(age 72)

•  No shareholder rights plan, also 
referred to as a “poison pill”

Board Engagement and Oversight
•  Annual Board strategy session and 

review of the company’s strategic plan 

•  Director overboarding policy  

•  Store-walk policy for directors

•  Board education and orientation 

program 

•  Annual Board and committee self-
evaluations, including individual 
director interviews

•  Management succession policy 

set forth in Corporate Governance 
Guidelines

• 

Independent directors meet without 
management

Board Oversight of Risk
The company has a robust framework designed to identify and ensure proper management of risk, including risk related to our 
ability to operate responsibly and sustainably. The framework that we use to identify and manage risk considers a number of 
enterprise-level issues, including competitive environment, brand and reputation, regulatory and compliance, and security, as 
well as external and internal factors that could distract the Company from our business or derail our strategic objectives. The 
Board oversees risk through this framework, with oversight accomplished by identifying key risks and mapping them to the 
appropriate Board Committee or to the full Board. 

Our Board reviews these key risks and the related framework annually, and the full Board or appropriate Board committees 
discuss selected risks in more detail throughout the year, including the COVID-19 pandemic, its related risks and its impact on 
our enterprise risk framework. The table below identifies key risk areas overseen by the Board and its committees.

GOVERNMENT RELATIONS

The Home Depot recognizes that laws at the federal, state and local level impact our business. 

We actively participate, and encourage our 
associates to participate, in the political 
process. Our Political Activity and 
Government Relations Policy provides 
the framework for our political activity. We 
engage in three key ways: 

•   Our Government Relations department  
     protects and expands our company’s  
     ability to take care of our associates,  
     customers and shareholders through  
     effective regulatory and legislative  
     action. Our Government Relations  
     team works to optimize the  
     government’s impact on the business   
     through effective lobbying, relationship  
     building and political engagement.

•  We have a political action committee 
(PAC) that connects our salaried 
associates to the political process 
and pools their personal contributions 
to financially support pro-business 
candidates who understand issues of 
importance to The Home Depot and 
our associates. As a long-standing 
practice, we do not contribute to 
presidential campaigns or endorse 
presidential candidates. 

•  The Home Depot supports trade 

associations that advocate on behalf 
of the business community and 
retail sector and reports annually 
the aggregate dues paid to those 
associations that engage in lobbying 
activities.

In deciding where we want to focus our 
advocacy, these are some of our top 
priorities:

•  Driving sales by ensuring online-only 
marketplaces follow the same rules 
on accountability and transparency as 
interconnected retailers

•  Supporting our Supply Chain initiative 
by advocating for funding for roads, 
ports and bridges and for laws that 
allow safer, heavier trucks to reduce 
loads and our environmental footprint

•  Growing margin dollars by working 
to get laws passed that target 
sophisticated, organized retail crime 
rings to reduce theft and support free 
trade

•  Taking care of our people by making 
sure we have a say in laws that could 
affect associate flexibility and career 
growth

CHECK IT OUT
For the first time, The Home Depot has created an Economic Impact 
interactive map that highlights the importance of its business in 
communities around the country. The Economic Impact map, which 
was created in collaboration in collaboration between our Government 
Relations, Tax and Strategic Business Development teams, along 
with PwC, includes information about employment numbers, taxes, 
community involvement, and donations of critical COVID-19 supplies. 
The map gives a state-by-state breakdown so customers and associates 
can easily see the impact in their communities.

Oversight of Our Political Activity
Our Government Relations department, led 
by a vice president who reports to our general 
counsel, manages our political activity. The team 
carefully analyzes our engagement activities, trade 
association partnerships, and political contributions 
for alignment with our key priorities, guided by 
our Core Values. All of The Home Depot’s political 
contributions are made to promote the interests 
of the company and without regard for the private 
political preferences of executives or directors. 
The Government Relations team is responsible 
for ensuring all PAC and corporate political 
contributions are made in accordance with the law 
and company policies. The team participates in 
regular trainings and performs routine reviews to 
monitor compliance. 

The Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee of our Board of Directors provides 
additional oversight, conducting an annual review 
of our Political Activity and Government Relations 
Policy, the company’s political contributions and 
payments to trade associations that engage in 
lobbying activities. 

The Nominating & Corporate Governance 
Committee must approve in advance any public 
advertisement directly or indirectly paid for by the 
Company that expressly advocates the election 
or defeat of a candidate in which Home Depot 
is identified specifically as an advocate of such 
election or defeat. To date, the company has not 
made any expenditure for such electioneering 
communications, and has no present plans to make 
any such expenditures. 

The Home Depot PAC’s finances, governance and 
communications are governed by a PAC Board. 
The PAC Board is chaired by the vice president 
of Government Relations and is made up of 
representatives from each functional area of the 
business and each field division to ensure a wide 
range of experiences and perspectives.   

We provide transparency in our actions by 
publishing an annual report of the company’s 
political contributions and the aggregate dues 
paid to trade associations that engage in 
lobbying activities, and any independent political 
expenditures by the Company supporting or 
opposing ballot initiatives and contributions 
to ballot measures committees. We list trade 
associations to which our company makes 
yearly payments of $5,000 or more, and our PAC 
contributions are publicly available on the Federal 
Election Commission website.

PATH OF THE PAC DOLLAR
Our political action committee connects salaried 
associates to the political process and pools their personal 
contributions to financially support pro-business candidates 
who understand issues of importance to The Home Depot 
and our associates.

our company, and we build relationships with elected 
officials who help enable our ability to implement 
those strategies to the benefit of our associates, 
customers, shareholders and communities. Here 
are the primary, business-focused criteria the PAC 
considers when deciding which candidates to support:

The Home Depot 

•  Favorable position on one or more legislative 

issues that align with The Home Depot’s business 
objectives

CORPORATE TAXES

We do the right thing for our associates, shareholders and communities by ensuring we pay our fair share of taxes 
and manage them transparently.

Taxes are a significant component of The 
Home Depot’s economic contribution 
to the countries, states and local 
communities in which we operate. Our 
commitment to our core values informs 
how we approach taxes. Responsible 
management of The Home Depot’s 
taxes includes: 

•    Seeking reasonable interpretations of 
laws where there may be ambiguity

•  Engaging proactively and 

transparently with tax authorities, 
when appropriate, to seek clarity, 
guidance or agreement on tax 
positions

Alignment with Our Business
Our corporate entity structure reflects 
the alignment with our commercial 
activities to ensure that we pay our 
fair share of tax commensurate with 
our business’ geographical footprint 
and operations within a jurisdiction. 
Additionally, we seek and claim tax 
incentives that: 

•   Align with our business 

•   Are consistent with the statutory or  
     regulatory framework 

•   Drive economic development and job  
     creation in the communities in which    
     we operate

We actively engage with federal, state 
and local governments; tax authorities; 
trade associations; and other business 
groups to advocate for policies that align 
with our approach to tax management, 
including the ways we: 

•   Support tax policies that drive  
     a vibrant, competitive and growing  
     economy 

•   Staff our stores based upon revenue  
     generated within the stores; thus, a  
     strong economy that includes  
     balanced taxation policy drives  
     revenue that supports employment

Accountability & Governance 
Tax governance is overseen by the Audit 
Committee of the Board of Directors. 
At least once a year, company leaders 
report to the Audit Committee regarding 
our approach to managing taxes. Learn 
more about our Corporate Governance 
structure on Page 76. 

Risk Management 

We identify and manage risks associated 
with taxes, including: 

•   Legislative uncertainty 

•   Reputational risk, including that a tax  
     position taken by the company may  
     not be consistent with our guiding  
     principles or may expose the  
     company to negative publicity 

•   Scarcity of talented tax professionals  
     to recruit and hire as associates 

Compliance 
We comply with tax laws in the 
jurisdictions in which we operate, 
including reporting and paying our taxes 
in a timely manner by: 

•   Employing appropriate resources and      
     controls to ensure that our tax  
     reporting is accurate and complete 

•   Supporting audits of our tax reporting  
     and control environment by our  
     internal control team and  
     independent, third-party auditors, as  
     required for publicly traded  
     companies

DATA SECURITY & PRIVACY

We value and respect the privacy of our customers, associates, service providers and business partners. Our approach to data 
security enables us to drive a collectively secure culture.

The Home Depot Privacy and Security 
Statement provides information 
about how we collect, use and share 
information we collect from our 
customers and visitors. 

We discuss the ways we use the 
information we collect, and how 
customers can find out more about the 
personal information we collect about 
them, on the Privacy & Security Center 
page of our corporate website. 

We leverage the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
Cybersecurity Framework as the 
foundation of our cybersecurity 
program. As cybersecurity 
attackers become increasingly more 
sophisticated, our program prioritizes 
threat mitigation, while focusing on 
maintaining the integrity and resiliency of 
our systems. We invest in our ability to 
identify, protect and detect security risks 
within our environment. 

In the event that we identify a security 
issue, we have defined procedures 
to respond and recover as quickly as 
possible. Overseeing our efforts on a 
day-to-day basis is our Information 
Technology Security team, led by an 
officer-level chief information security 
officer. Our approach enables us to drive 
a collectively secure culture.

Governance, Risk & Compliance
•  The Home Depot has a Data Security 
and Privacy Governance Committee, 
composed of a cross-functional 
group of senior leadership, that 
oversees the strategy and approach 
in place to manage the security and 
privacy of customer, associate and 
business data.

• 

Information security and privacy 
policies are in place and are informed 
by regulatory requirements.  These 
policies are reviewed periodically 
to ensure they remain aligned with 
current requirements.

•  Targeted audits and penetration tests 
are conducted throughout the year 
by internal and external entities.

•  We are compliant with the Payment 

Card Industry Data Security 
Standard.

•  We engage an industry-leading third 
party to independently evaluate our 
information security maturity on an 
annual basis. 

DID YOU KNOW
Our Privacy and Security Statement 
extends to personal information we 
receive from business partners and 
other third parties.

Data Protection
•  The Home Depot has established 
data classification and retention 
policies focused on limiting the risk of 
unauthorized exposure of customer, 
associate and business data.

•  Data protection strategies are 
in place and focused on data 
devaluation and data access 
monitoring.

•  Sensitive data attributes are 

classified into domains with defined 
security expectations for data-at-rest 
and data-in-transit.

Vendor Security
•  The Home Depot’s vendor risk 
management program works to 
classify service provider or business 
partner risk based on several factors, 
including, but not limited to, data 
type accessed and/or retained.

•  Security risk assessments are 
conducted for targeted service 
provider and business partner 
relationships. 

•  Where applicable, service providers 

and business partners are 
contractually obligated to protect 
restricted data provided by or 
received from The Home Depot.

Data Security & Privacy 
Awareness
• 

 Data security and privacy training 
and awareness are provided to all 
associates on an annual basis, and 
additional customized, role-based 
training is provided to targeted 
internal audiences.

These forward looking statements may relate to, among other things, our goals, commitments and programs, and projections of future results, including our ability to meet our goals the impact on our business, operations and financial results of the COVID 19 pandemic and the related recovery our business plans, strategies, initiatives and objectives and their expected execution and impact management of relationships with our associates, potential associates, suppliers and service providers cost and availability of labor costs of fuel and other energy sources international trade disputes, natural disasters, climate change, public health issues (including pandemics and quarantines, related shut downs and other governmental orders, and similar restrictions, as well as subsequent re openings), cybersecurity events, military conflicts or acts of war, and other business interruptions that could disrupt operation of our facilities, our ability to operate or access communications, financial or banking systems, or supply or delivery of, or demand for, the Company’s products or services the impact of regulatory changes the impact of acquired companies on our organization and our assumptions, expectations and projections regarding any of the foregoing.

Forward looking statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events.

They are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control, dependent on the actions of third parties, or currently unknown to us as well as potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially.

These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10 K, and also in future reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements other than as required by law.

You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in our other public statements.

Issues deemed material for purposes of this report may not be considered material for SEC reporting purposes.

We organize our approach to corporate responsibility around three key pillars: Focusing on Our People, Operating Sustainably and Strengthening Our Communities.

When I joined The Home Depot more than 22 years ago, I could never have imagined that I would have the opportunity to lead such an incredible organization.

Prior to becoming CEO, I had the privilege to work in multiple departments across the organization.

One thing that has always been clear to me is that our values driven culture and passion for our customers has been instrumental to our success.

Built around our core values, our approach to ESG centers around three key pillars Focus on Our People, Operate Sustainably, and Strengthen Our Communities.

By identifying these three pillars, we can concentrate on the areas where we can have the greatest impact.

Our 2022 ESG Report details the daily work we do to support these three pillars, as well as the progress we made in 2021 thanks to the dedication and ingenuity of our associates and suppliers.

Our focus on people centers around continuously striving to create a work environment that is inclusive, engaging, and rewarding to associates.

Our associates’ outstanding performance in 2021 enabled 100% of our stores to qualify for Success Sharing bonus payments to non management associates.

We also offer training and development that transforms jobs into careers, which is reflected in the fact that approximately 90% of our U.S. store leaders began as hourly associates.

Our U.S. workforce is more ethnically diverse than the U.S. working population.

In addition, we increased the representation of female and underrepresented minority groups across our managers and above cohort in the U.S. during 2021.

By identifying these three pillars, we can concentrate on the areas where we can have the greatest impact.

Our efforts to operate sustainably begin with our understanding that our biggest impact on the environment comes from the products we sell.

Our partnership with suppliers allows us to give our customers access to hundreds of products that are good for their homes, good for the environment, and good for their wallets.

In 2021, we estimate our customers’ purchases of Energy Star products helped reduce annual electricity use by 7 billion kilowatt hours, saving 950 million on energy costs, and lowering carbon emissions by 4.9 million metric tons.

Our water saving products allowed customers to reduce consumption by over 66 billion gallons.

We believe our associates should reflect the customers and communities we serve.

In 2021, approximately 36% of our U.S. new hires were women, while more than 57% of U.S. new hires were from an underrepresented minority group.

Our commitment to diversity also extends to our supplier relationships.

In 2021, we increased our spend with diverse suppliers to 3.3 billion and have announced a goal to achieve 5 billion in direct annual spend with diverse suppliers by 2025.

We also completed our goal to launch a Tier II supplier diversity program to encourage our suppliers to spend with diverse businesses.

We will continue to push forward in this area by partnering with organizations like the Billion Dollar Roundtable, an association geared at celebrating corporations that spend at least 1 billion per year with minority and woman owned suppliers, to further amplify our supplier diversity efforts.

We also value our nonprofit partners that enable The Home Depot Foundation to improve the homes and lives of U.S. veterans, train skilled tradespeople to fill the labor gap, and support communities affected by natural disasters.

In 2021, the Foundation achieved a milestone of ten years and over 400 million invested in support of veteran causes, on track to contribute half of a billion dollars to veteran causes by 2025.

While we have made significant progress, there is more work to do.

On Pages 9 and 10 of this report, you will see the goals we’ve set as we strive to build a better and more sustainable business.

We know that when we invest in running a responsible, sustainable company, we make our business stronger, more agile, and more resilient. 2021 was another year filled with great accomplishments, and I want to thank our associates and supplier partners for the many ways they enable us to do our part and live our values every day.

We also made progress in 2021 by operating more sustainably in our own business, reducing electricity consumption in our U.S. stores by approximately 11% year over year.

We cut U.S. store electricity usage a remarkable 50% since 2010.

A hallmark of progress in this area has been the transition to LED overhead lighting in our U.S. stores, which join our Canada and Mexico stores in having nearly all of interior lighting powered by LED bulbs.

While we remain focused on reducing our energy consumption, we are also making progress towards our goal of producing or procuring 100% renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot facilities worldwide by 2030.

We focus on strengthening our communities by giving back financially and through our associates’ time and efforts dedicated to Team Depot volunteer activities a hallmark of who we are.

In 2021, approximately 14,000 associates volunteered in communities across 150 cities nationwide.

Our Team Depot volunteers helped our communities prepare and respond to natural disasters like tornados, hurricanes, and wildfires, while also achieving more than 1.25 million hours of service to veterans since 2011.

We know that when we invest in running a responsible, sustainable company, we make our business stronger, more agile, and more resilient.

We value seeing ESG impact and opportunities through our operational lens and also through the lenses of our stakeholders.

As the largest home improvement retailer in the world, we have the unique opportunity to create positive impacts across a broad number of stakeholders.

We have also been reminded over the last two years how quickly our world can change, which is why we continue our practice of proactive engagement and provide numerous channels for feedback, so we can remain attentive to the concerns and needs of our stakeholders.

We have learned over the years that one of the best ways for us to make sure we understand the relevant environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts of our business and the current areas of focus of our many stakeholders is to engage with our stakeholders.

We receive constant feedback from our customers through the more than a billion and a half transactions across our stores and digital channels annually.

We survey our approximately 500,000 associates to measure how emotionally connected they are to their work.

We collaborate with our vendors and suppliers in an effort to lessen the environmental impact of the products we sell.

Individuals and organizations from around the globe reach out to us with questions or concerns about our operations or products.

We meet with shareholders and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) interested in our business practices.

We take part in industry efforts to raise awareness about the ESG responsibilities we all share.

Our ongoing interactions may be formal or informal, as detailed in our ESG Priority Assessment Framework on Page 7.

These interactions help validate our own priority assessment they also help us gauge the impact of our business, refine ESG priorities, measure our progress and design ways to improve.

By better understanding our impact and collaborating with stakeholders, we position our company to set objectives that allow us to contribute to building a better business, workplace and world.

Our Sustainability Council, composed of representatives from different areas of the business, oversees our approach to sustainability.

Members of the Council share stakeholder feedback from their functional areas.

The Council focuses on several key areas, as shown below.

The Council meets twice a year, and its chair presents our sustainability strategy and activities to the Board of Directors annually.

We also provide quarterly updates to our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regarding our ESG engagement.

Our ESG priorities and plans are communicated internally and externally via various channels, including in this annual report.

Stakeholders share their perspectives on our ESG practices.

Associates Empower us to be contributing team members of a values based organization.

Customers Be a global impact conscious company, and provide products that help me reduce my home’s environmental impact.

Academia Give us insight into customer trends and habits to aid our research.

Suppliers Give us an outlet to market innovative, sustainable products and a way to gather timely customer feedback.

Communities Support me and my neighbors by making a positive difference in our community.

NGOs Work with us to elevate our causes to action and progress.

Leading third party sustainability rating organizations monitor and report on our progress.

Below are some key ratings for our company in 2021.

Here are some of the organizations that recognized our efforts in 2021 to build a better workplace, business and world.

No. 90 Corporate Equality Index (USA) No. 82 Corporate Equality Index (Mexico).

Reducing The Home Depot’s environmental impact is essential to our efforts to build a better business, workplace and world.

Home Depot’s chief sustainability officer Ron Jarvis has spent more than two decades driving sustainability improvements at The Home Depot.

Many associates and business leaders throughout our enterprise They take pride in improving their departments and businesses in multiple ESG aspects.

Our leadership understands that an effective environmental, social and governance strategy cannot happen in isolation.

It is not the sole responsibility of a corporate ESG team.

Rather, our ESG strategy must reflect The Home Depot’s core values, and it must be embedded in all aspects of how we run our business.

One of our eight core values is Do The Right Thing, which drives our associates to find new ways that our organization can reduce its environmental impact.

This can be seen through our packaging team who looks for ways to reduce the package footprints and ways to use more sustainable materials for our private label products (see Page 55).

Another example are our associates who work to find ways to upcycle the packaging waste in our stores and supply chain into new products like Trex composite decking.

Our Eco Actions program, which builds on our original Eco Options program that we launched in 2007, helps our customers take on more sustainable DIY projects and choose greener products that can save water, conserve energy or are formulated to reduce certain chemicals.

Products can only qualify for this distinction if manufacturers provide third party verification of environmental claims that meet our program’s requirements.

This program also offers customers green project ideas and tips, for example, how to grow an organic garden (see Page 50).

In addition, we encourage our customers to drop off used compact fluorescent light bulbs and rechargeable batteries for recycling.

In 2021, we collected 1,162,800 pounds of recycled batteries, a 24% increase since 2014 (see Page 54).

We also help our customers go greener in ways that may be less apparent to them.

For example, we offer circularity centered products like our Home Depot branded moving boxes, made from 100% post consumer recycled paper fiber (see Page 45), as well as composite deck boards made from recycled plastic waste from our stores.

We continue to make progress on our goal to exclude expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film from our private brand product packaging by the end of 2023.

When customers rent tools from us, they help avoid the environmental impact of new product manufacturing.

Another example: Our stores have cut electricity consumption 50% since 2010, providing our customers a lower energy intensive shopping environment.

Overall, we believe good business decisions drive sustainability.

Examples of this can be seen through the investments we’ve made to create the most efficient supply chain in home improvement.

These investments have helped us reduce the number of trucks needed and distance traveled to get our products from our supplier to our customers, while also reducing fuel emissions.

Another example of this is our store investments, part of which included transitioning stores to LED lighting, which helped us reduce operating costs and electricity consumption.

We also believe that by working with our suppliers to bring innovative and sustainable products to market, we help our customers create more sustainable homes and workplaces.

Our efforts to drive innovation can be seen in every aisle of the store, and we believe this is a key differentiator in the market.

We also want to see sustainability be the norm for our entire industry.

We are encouraged when we see other retailers take big swings and do innovative things that push all of us to do a better job of protecting the planet, and we hope the innovation that we bring through our operations and products motivates others to do the same.

Our core values guide how we focus on our people, operate sustainably and strengthen our communities and provide a benchmark for measuring progress.

We focus on our people by striving for an environment centered on The Home Depot’s core value of respect for all people, where diversity, equity and inclusion are celebrated and associates have opportunities to grow.

We believe our approximately 500,000 associates are our greatest asset, and they differentiate us in the marketplace.

We strive to create an environment centered around our eight core values, where diversity, equity and inclusion fuel opportunities for our associates, communities, and suppliers.

While our office of Diversity Inclusion has existed within the company for more than a decade to help diversify our workforce and support change in our communities, we expanded in 2020 and renamed it to fit an enhanced mission: Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI). Adding equity to our focus reflects our desire to promote fairness, remove bias and ensure all of our associates and business partners have access to the resources they need to succeed at work.

In 2021, we met our goal to expand our associate resource groups (ARGs) beyond our Store Support Center (corporate facility) to include more associates and increase engagement and participation.

Through our new associate engagement platform, Yammer, all our U.S. associates are now able to access our ARGs.

We also leveraged Yammer to reach more associates with C.A.R.E.

We were also able to meet our goal to launch a Tier II supplier diversity program in 2021.

Beyond the 3.3 billion we spent with diverse Tier I (direct) suppliers last year, our new program will help us measure and encourage our Tier I suppliers to spend more with diverse businesses.

Find out more about our supplier diversity efforts on Page 60.

Learn more about how we work with our community partners across the nation and how spending with diverse suppliers benefits our company and our communities on Pages 58 61.

At The Home Depot, we focus on three key areas to create meaningful change through thoughtful actions that align with all eight of our core values.

Increasing diverse representation throughout our organization.

Creating an environment where every associate feels included and valued for who they are.

Promoting equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, training, development and advancement.

Increasing our penetration and spend with diverse suppliers.

Developing diverse suppliers by providing mentorship and shared resources.

We have many initiatives currently in the works, including an expansion of our existing Retool Your School program to further strengthen our commitment to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).

This expansion, set to launch in 2023, will include more programming and a broader reach (See Page 62).

In addition, we are working to enlarge our network of external partner organizations to enhance the career development of our female, minority, LGBTQ and veteran associates.

When Khareem Mitchell started with The Home Depot in 2018, he discovered a workplace where his personal principles aligned with company values.

His Afro Hispanic roots play a big role in how he conducts his life both inside and outside of work.

Derek Bottoms, chief diversity officer and vice president of associate relations, explains how diversity, equity and inclusion align with our company values.

Mission Statement The Home Depot ignites the doer in all of us to build a culture of understanding, acceptance and appreciation.

Vision Statement The Home Depot is building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive organization, within our enterprise and the communities we are proud to serve.

Grounded in our core values, we have the conviction, capabilities and tools to make a difference for our associates, community partners and suppliers.

At The Home Depot, our values guide us on everything we do.

They serve as our foundation, and they are embedded in our culture.

Our expanded focus on diversity, equity and inclusion supports all eight of our core values, including respect for all people, giving back and building strong relationships with other associates and our customers.

We strive to build a workplace and retail space that reflect the communities we serve.

A diverse and inclusive workplace also creates shareholder value by providing different perspectives and fresh ideas that spark innovation.

On the community side, we are continuing to partner with local and national organizations focused on closing the wealth gap and advancing education for all.

We continue to amplify our supplier diversity efforts to drive innovation, economic opportunities and shareholder value by directing more of our dollars, directly and indirectly, toward diverse businesses.

We look to partner with organizations like the Billion Dollar Roundtable whose mission aligns with our focus areas.

To further our commitment to supplier diversity, we are also seeking to achieve 5 billion in direct annual spend with diverse suppliers by 2025.

See Page 60 to learn more about our supplier diversity efforts.

I’m excited about our plans to expand Our Retool Your School program in 2023, which has provided campus beautification funding to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) since 2009.

By expanding the reach of this program, we can further strengthen our commitment to HBCUs and their students, including through career development opportunities.

We recently expanded our associate resource groups (ARGs) to all associates companywide, including in stores and distribution centers.

Previously, these groups were only available to our Store Support Center (SSC) associates.

In an aligned effort, we are identifying tools and platforms to directly engage with our hourly front line associates to share DEI related information and resources.

We also are raising awareness of DEI and its importance by modernizing our learning materials holding listening sessions where executives hear from associates across the organization and focusing on recruiting and talent planning strategies that emphasize diversity and inclusion.

Our diverse workforce strengthens our competitive advantages and reflects the customers and communities we serve.

A comparison against U.S. Department of Labor data shows that our U.S. workforce is more ethnically diverse than the nation’s working population.

In 2021, we also expanded the number and percentage of women and minorities at the manager level and above.

These charts reflect the demographics of The Home Depot’s U.S. workforce from fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2021.

Certain percentages may not sum to 100% due to rounding or, in 2020 and 2021, some associates choosing not to self identify by race ethnicity or gender.

The 2020 and 2021 results include data for HD Supply Holdings Inc.

Includes manager level positions and above at stores, distribution centers and other field locations, as well as at our Store Support Center excludes officers.

The 2020 2021 results include data for HD Supply Holdings Inc.

Since 2013, The Home Depot has added 11 directors to its Board, seven of whom were women, members of a historically under represented racial or ethnic group or both.

As of May 2022, our Board had 10 male directors (71%) and 4 female directors (29%).

And of the 12 independent directors, 33% are women and 33% are members of historically under represented racial or ethnic groups.

For additional information on our board composition, visit the Corporate Governance section of our website.

Associate engagement is the emotional connection associates have to our company and our goals.

It is vital to The Home Depot’s culture and success.

Highly engaged associates care about their work and the performance of The Home Depot.

Our passion is to create an engaging and inclusive workplace we do so by proactively engaging with our associates, while also listening and responding to their feedback.

In 2021, we introduced an additional Voice of the Associate survey to all our associates.

Our two Voice of the Associate surveys Census and Pulse provided us the opportunity to hear from our associates at least twice in 2021.

Our Census survey is an annual in depth look at our associate’s engagement and satisfaction with their job and with the Home Depot, while our Pulse survey is typically shorter and seeks feedback on specific topics.

Based on the Voice of the Associate 2021 Census survey, we saw the highest engagement numbers across the enterprise that we have seen in the past few years.

In addition, we also added two additional surveys Onboarding and Exit, into our Lifecycle Listening toolbelt.

These additional surveys allow us to intentionally connect with associates at specific moments within their career at The Home Depot.

Engagement Platform In 2021, our new associate engagement platform Yammer, which was launched at the end of fiscal 2020 helped create new collaboration spaces and opportunities for reaching associates across the business.

Whether through on site desktops or on the go mobile devices, more than 450,000 associates across the U.S. and Canada have access to Yammer.

With more than 650 active communities in the network, the digital hub links associates to both their local co workers and corporate support across North America.

It serves as a central hub to recognize associates for living our values, promote company news, cultivate connections between front line and corporate associates and fuel the orange blooded entrepreneurial spirit that’s part of what drives our business every day.

Our philosophy of taking care of our people and motivating them to deliver a superior customer experience shapes our profit sharing program for hourly associates.

Success Sharing provides semi annual cash awards for performance against our business plan, including sales and productivity goals.

The program has granted awards totaling more than 1 billion to associates over the last two years.

The outstanding performance of our associates in fiscal 2021 enabled 100% of stores to qualify for Success Sharing in both the first and second half of the year.

This resulted in record award payments to our non management associates of approximately 739 million.

We also continue to make investments in our associates recent actions include our decision at the end of 2020 to transition our COVID related enhanced associate pay and benefits to permanent compensation enhancements for front line, hourly associates.

In addition, we continued matching contributions under our FutureBuilder 401(k) Plan, and merit based salary increases.

Our People: Pay Equity The Home Depot’s commitment to doing the right thing and taking care of our people extends to our pay practices.

To ensure that we are paying our associates fairly, we conduct an annual analysis of our pay and compensation practices for our U.S. associates (who comprise approximately 89% of our workforce), in consultation with expert third party firms following industry leading standards.

Our review of our U.S. associates’ total W 2 compensation for calendar year 2021, including base pay, cash bonuses, and stock, showed that, adjusting for relevant factors such as tenure, position, location and hours worked, associates who identified as female earned approximately 101% of what male associates earned, and associates who identified as members of a racial or ethnic minority earned approximately 99% of what non minority associates earned.

Not adjusting for those factors, our analysis showed that the median annualized W 2 pay for U.S. associates who identified as female was 98% of the median for men, and that the median pay for racial ethnic minority associates in the U.S. was 94% of the median for non minority associates.

The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which is tasked with providing oversight of our human capital management strategy and our diversity and inclusion efforts, receives regular updates on these findings.

We will continue to strive to ensure equal pay across our organization.

In 2021, Home Depot’s Yammer network was recognized as the 1 Yammer network among large organizations in the Americas by SWOOP Analytics.

Our associate resource groups promote inclusion and support diversity.

Our associate resource groups (ARGs) are led by associates and sponsored by executive leaders.

They drive associate engagement and promote inclusion across our company through fostering professional development, raising cultural awareness, celebrating diversity, and community outreach.

We have seven U.S. ARGs, each supporting the company’s business objectives and policies, particularly those related to developing our associates, creating diversity awareness and engaging diverse community partners.

In 2021, we revised our ARG structure to further support the career development of associates who voluntarily lead these groups.

We also achieved our goal of expanding associate resource groups to include more of our people.

We hosted more than 70 ARG events virtually in 2021 to celebrate diversity, raise cultural awareness and foster professional development.

We continue to expand outreach to associates to encourage their engagement in our ARGs.

The Home Depot was named to Forbes’ list of Best Employers for Diversity in 2019, 2021 and 2022.

We launched Caring Conversations in 2020 in response to the unrest in our community.

The virtual events for all associates included panel discussions where senior company leaders shared candid stories about race and ethnicity, and experts from outside our company educated associates about civil rights, laws, voting and more.

In 2021, Caring Conversations evolved into C.A.R.E.

Talks, a series of diversity discussions that Champion Awareness, Respect, and Equity for all associates.

These discussions include external speaker series, panel discussions, and small group listening sessions, and we occasionally partnered with our Associate Resource Groups on elevating keynote speakers in this format.

These diversity discussions will be expanded to include additional formats in 2022.

Supplier Diversity Panel: The impact HD and many of its suppliers have on making their associates have better lives is inspiring and heartfelt.

HBCU Panel: The alignment between THD’s values and the values instilled in students attending HBCUs resonated with me.

As an HBCU alum, my experience was similar to the panelists’ experiences, i.e.

Ken’s Krew Program: The sheer pride that poured out of that young man and his mother literally made my day.

We take for granted sometimes the roles we have and this was a nice reminder.

Our learning and development programs expand skills and capabilities so associates can master their current roles and prepare for future ones.

The Home Depot strives to build a learning rich workplace where associates and leaders are prepared to succeed, motivated to serve our customers well and given opportunities to grow.

Our Home Depot University, now in its 12th year, is critical to the development of values based leaders who take care of our associates, customers, and communities.

In March 2021, associate Keoki Souza purchased his first home.

As a result of my career with The Home Depot, I’ve been able to help provide the life my family deserves.

Military service members and military spouses are resilient, resourceful and team minded.

Supporting them is the right thing to do for our communities and our company.

Honoring those who serve or who have served us is fundamental to our ESG pillar of Strengthening our Communities.

Our focus on the military community and their families includes the tens of thousands of veterans and military spouses in our workforce.

Through our recently expanded Military Relations department, we look for ways to make The Home Depot an employer of choice for military members, veterans and their families.

One of those veterans is Pete Capel, who has created a 30 year career with The Home Depot.

Like his father who served in the Navy during WWII, Pete joined the Marine Corps in 1983.

During his 7 year military career maintaining radar systems, he was promoted to the rank of sergeant and was awarded the Navy Achievement Medal twice, an award that recognizes outstanding achievement or meritorious service and is recognized across all military branches.

After Pete left the Marine Corps in 1990, he began to think about what was next in his life.

That’s when his story with The Home Depot started in the most unlikely of ways.

Pete was getting his hair cut when Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank, Home Depot co founders, appeared on TV.

As they were talking about how the company got started, Pete looked up and saw that there was a Home Depot store across the street.

After his appointment ended, Pete walked over and immediately applied for a job.

Pete was originally employed as a store sales associate in the electrical department.

Since then, he’s held positions of increasing responsibility over his 30 year career.

Today, he’s the vice president of field merchandising for the northern, southern, and western divisions.

Just as Pete did more than 30 years ago, Richard Cranford and Aminah Meho recently left careers in the Army and Air Force, respectively, and found new opportunities with The Home Depot.

Through programs like Hiring our Heroes, The Home Depot partners with organizations that support military members who are transitioning into a second career and can help veterans find a role they enjoy.

A majority of Homer Fund contributions come from associates.

Every dollar our people donate helps a co worker in need.

Financial Preparation In addition to our grant and scholarship programs, we provide associates with access to a range of Homer Fund backed resources to support their financial well being and decision making, including how to save for emergencies and protect themselves against fraud.

Nearly 18.8 million was awarded through Homer Fund grants.

Associate financial assistance included 358 grants totaling 1.2 million related to COVID 19 hardships, and 2,920 grants totaling 2.7 million for disaster recovery.

The Homer Fund provides financial assistance to associates facing unexpected hardships, helps associates’ children pay for college and supports our people with financial information to help them prepare for emergencies.

Grant Programs Direct Grants help associates facing emergencies and tragic events, such as the death of a parent or child, natural disaster, illness or injury, a spouse’s layoff and more, up to 10,000.

Matching Grants are a unique way The Homer Fund recognizes the generosity of associates toward one another.

When associates collect donations for a co worker in need, their money is matched by The Homer Fund 2 for every 1 associates collect, up to 5,000 or the associate’s actual need.

Matching Grants may be used for qualifying expenses that are ineligible for Direct Grants.

They also may be used to complement Direct Grants, providing additional support to associates in need.

Scholarships for Associates’ Children The Homer Fund’s Orange Scholars program offers scholarships to qualified children or dependents of hourly associates based on financial need, academic performance, community involvement and leadership.

Since the Orange Scholars launch in 2006, the program has awarded scholarships to more than 15,000 recipients, totaling 36 million.

Since 1999, The Homer Fund grants totaling approximately 230 million have assisted approximately 164,000 associates facing unexpected hardships.

By focusing on workplace safety training and risk reduction, we help keep our associates and customers injury free.

The Home Depot strives to provide the safest working and shopping environment for our associates and customers.

A major component in the strategy is raising awareness of risks among both front line associates and leaders.

When our people are trained to recognize and correct hazards, our workplace is primed for continual improvement.

In 2021 we launched an awareness campaign called Safety Takes EveryONE. This message exemplifies that everyone, at all levels of the organization, must contribute to the safety of our associates and customers.

At the individual level of the campaign, each associate is provided tools to avoid risk, with every decision made, resulting in everyday safety.

Safety Takes EveryONE is our rally cry to remind associates that safety is their most important responsibility and allows us to send everyone home safely.

The leader approach to Safety Takes EveryONE utilizes the acronym ONE. This second arm of the campaign focuses of our leaders’ efforts to increase awareness of the higher risk injury categories.

The O is for Overexertion Whether associates are handling product in a distribution center, receiving freight in a store, helping a customer load product into their vehicle or delivering bulky product to a jobsite, lifting too much or too frequently can result in injury.

To prevent these injuries, we ask our leaders to engage with associates to create sustainable habits centered on our Lift it Close to Home ergonomic program.

This program reminds individuals to minimize strain on their shoulders and back by anchoring the product lifted to their apron’s Home Depot logo, promoting safer lifting techniques.

Our focus is to ensure our newest associates are set up for safety success.

Starting with their initial onboarding, we have simplified and prioritized safety training earlier in an associate’s experience to raise awareness around the riskiest tasks.

We reinforce our onboarding program with monthly awareness topics and leader driven engagements during the first six months of employment to allow associates to ask questions and provide feedback to improve safety.

Safety Takes EveryONE requires leaders to engage with their associates early in their career to establish a positive safety culture.

Equipment is essential to all areas of our business and it is paramount that it is operated in a safe manner.

Safety Takes EveryONE requires leaders to interact with associates through safety engagements focusing on the safe operations of both the driver and the associates working around the equipment.

The results of these engagements are reviewed and shared with leaders to create a continuous improvement model.

This heightened awareness drives innovation that will remove risk from our business and improve the safety within our stores and facilities.

Safety is not one person’s responsibility, Safety Takes EveryONE to create an environment that fosters feedback, empowers our associates and leaders to make the safest decision, and allows every associate and customer to go home safely to their loved ones every day.

The Home Depot’s lost time incident rate was lower than industry averages for our retail class, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Recordable and lost time incident rates for U.S. store associates.

We strive to reduce our carbon footprint by improving the efficiency of our store and supply chain operations, and by investing in alternative energy solutions.

We partner with suppliers focused on social and environmental responsibility, and we help our customers reduce their environmental impact by offering products and packaging created with sustainability in mind.

By driving efficiencies and investing in green energy, we reduced our absolute combined Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by approximately 172,000 metric tons in 2021.

The Home Depot uses the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, which has been adopted by numerous companies worldwide to calculate metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to reduce them.

We continually review and refine our emissions measurements to reflect changes to our business and improvements in data collection and reporting.

CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, is an independent, international, nonprofit organization that provides a global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share environmental information.

Our latest score of A from CDP reflects our leadership and high level of action on climate change mitigation, adaptation and transparency.

Under our science based target goal linked to our annual CDP reporting, we have committed to reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon dioxide emissions 2.1% per year to achieve a 40% reduction by 2030 and a 50% reduction by 2035.

New this year, our annual GHG emissions and carbon intensities correspond to our fiscal year results, which will also be disclosed in our response to the annual CDP Climate Change questionnaire.

Our results include data for HD Supply Holdings Inc., which we acquired on December 24, 2020.

In 2021, we decreased our Scope 1 and 2 carbon intensity.

Our investments in efficiency helped us achieve a 21% reduction in the carbon dioxide emitted for each dollar of revenue we earned, compared to 2020.

Scope 1: Direct emissions from combustible sources and refrigerants totaled approximately 642,000 metric tons.

Scope 2: Indirect emissions from purchasing electricity totaled approximately 1,007,000 metric tons.

Scope 3: We are currently assessing our Scope 3 emissions.

The Home Depot joined RE100 with our goal to produce or procure 100% renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot facilities by 2030.

This action helps us move towards the company’s emission reduction targets.

By conserving resources we reduce business costs and our company’s impact on the environment.

Running our stores more efficiently furthers both our business and sustainability goals.

In 2021, we hit key milestones, including a 50% decrease in U.S. store electricity use since 2010.

When we launched our store electricity conservation efforts a few years ago, we anticipated reducing U.S. store electricity use 20% over a decade.

But by tapping into technologies and closely tracking and analyzing use, we were able to save more electricity than we originally imagined.

In 2021 alone, we reduced year over year U.S. store electricity use approximately 11%.

We learned a great deal from the progress we made reducing electricity use in our stores, and now we are applying our experience and proven strategies to conserving resources in other areas of our business, including electricity use in our supply chain and water use in store irrigation.

Our successful energy conservation efforts have helped us move closer to our goal of producing or procuring 100% renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot facilities worldwide by 2030.

In 2021, we completed our multi year project to upgrade U.S. stores to overhead LED lighting, retrofitting 383 stores in 2021 alone.

Now LEDs light up nearly all our store aisles across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

In the U.S., we have invested approximately 230 million in total capital expenditures on LED upgrades since 2018.

Our U.S. stores with LEDs consume about 30% less electricity than similar stores with conventional lighting.

Harnessing power from the sun is essential to our renewable electricity aims, and we’re making progress by buying electricity from large scale commercial solar farms.

In 2021, Enel Green Power’s Azure Sky began operating in Haskell County, Texas, west of Dallas, providing us with 75 megawatts of renewable electricity.

We have agreed to purchase another 150 megawatts from companies building solar farms elsewhere in Texas.

Once operating, we expect these commercial solar farms, in addition to our wind farm projects, to provide us with enough electricity to power the equivalent of more than 500 Home Depot stores.

Making Every kWh Count The Home Depot reduced U.S. store electricity consumption 50% since 2010 through a multifaceted effort to find energy savings in every corner of the store.

Enel Green Power’s Azure Sky solar and storage plant in Texas began operating in 2021 and provides 75 megawatts of solar power to Home Depot stores.

Rooftop Solar Harvests Renewable Energy Seeing the potential to use soccer field size space atop our stores to harvest the sun’s power, we installed our first rooftop solar farm in 2014.

By the end of 2021, solar farms operated on 76 Home Depot stores and one distribution center in the U.S.

Increasing the amount of roof space allocated to solar panels at our stores.

Exploring possibilities for adding solar panels atop more distribution facilities.

A pilot program launched in 2019 showed us the potential of using smart irrigation systems to save water at our stores.

We rolled out the technology to 164 additional stores in 2021 503 U.S. stores were using smart irrigation systems by the end of the year.

On average, there is a 29% reduction in water used to irrigate landscaping, compared to stores with traditional timer based irrigation systems.

Here’s how it works: In ground sensors, real time weather data and other data sources guide when sprinklers come on and how long they operate.

So, a store’s landscaped areas are watered according to plants’ needs, rather than the clock.

We also help our customers harness the power of the sun.

In partnership with Sunrun, we help our customers create clean and sustainable electricity.

On average, fuel cells helped power 204 U.S. stores with more than 100% of their electricity needs annually.

At 55 U.S. stores, on site batteries store power during off peak times for use when demand spikes.

The energy capacity we purchase from the Los Mirasoles Wind Farm in McAllen, Texas, is enough wind power to run 125 Home Depot stores.

By making our supply chain more efficient, we reduce business costs and the impact that our product distribution has on the environment.

We continue to make progress on our multi year supply chain initiative to create the fastest, most efficient and reliable delivery network for home improvement products.

When we announced our approximately 1.2 billion supply chain initiative in 2017, we could have never envisioned the disruption to the global supply chain because of the pandemic.

Due to our supply chain investments, however, we have demonstrated our ability to navigate any environment.

In addition, our supply chain investments have helped us move record amounts of product more efficiently.

Despite seeing another year of record product volume move through our business, our new supply chain facilities helped us reduce the miles driven to get products from our vendors to our customers.

Even as supply chain volume increased, the efficiencies we gained in our operations and our investments in green energy helped us reduce our carbon intensity.

We participate in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s SmartWay program to collect and report greenhouse gas emissions data from corporate supply chains.

The Home Depot is a seven time recipient of the SmartWay Excellence Award.

In 2021, we installed hydrogen fuel cells at three U.S. supply chain facilities, giving us 15 locations with emissions free fuel for forklifts.

We estimate these fuel cells helped us reduce electricity consumption by about 21 million kilowatt hours in 2021.

We do a technology assisted assessment of scheduled pickups and deliveries, then recommend optimized routes to reduce miles traveled, fuel consumed and trucks on the road.

By partnering with suppliers to forgo pallets, we can stack products to the top of trailers, resulting in a reduction in the number of truckloads needed to transport some goods.

As we roll out our new distribution facilities, we’ve partnered with Plug Power to fuel some of our new facility’s material handling fleets, like forklifts, with zero emission hydrogen fuel.

This is another way we are reducing our environmental impact while building a best in class supply chain.

We sell available space on our trucks and buy space from other companies, ensuring fewer underloaded trailers hit the road.

That space sharing saves about 2 million driven miles a year.

Optimization technology guides how we pack trucks or ocean bound containers.

We maximize the product load, reducing the number of truckloads and containers and overall emissions.

We support suppliers that take action toward maintaining our collective commitment to human rights and safety in our supply chain.

We owe it to our customers, associates and communities to further the collective commitment to human rights, safety and environmentally sound practices through ethical sourcing.

We engage our suppliers in this commitment by requiring them to produce products in factories that adhere to responsible sourcing standards.

We report on our progress in an annual Responsible Sourcing Report.

Our Responsible Sourcing Standards mandate that suppliers and factories abide by all applicable international and local laws, rules and regulations in the manufacturing and distribution of merchandise or services provided to us.

We conduct audits of factories around the world to ensure compliance with our responsible sourcing standards.

Suppliers must maintain on site documentation that demonstrates compliance with our responsible sourcing standards.

They also must allow Home Depot associates and or representatives full access to production facilities, worker records, production records and workers for confidential interviews in connection with monitoring visits.

We expect our suppliers to promptly correct any noncompliance, starting with timely preparation and presentation of a corrective and preventative action plan.

We also re audit supplier facilities, with the frequency depending on their performance in prior audits.

If suppliers fail to improve, we may terminate our business relationships with them.

Equally important, we support factories that take action to create lasting social and environmental compliance programs.

We encourage suppliers and factory workers to communicate concerns via processes outlined in our corporate Code of Conduct.

Laws and regulations Child labor Forced labor Harassment and abuse Compensation Hours of work Non discrimination Freedom of association and collective bargaining Health and safety Environment Subcontracting Communication Business ethics Monitoring and compliance.

We work with our suppliers to ensure they implement responsible sourcing and encourage their smelters to obtain conflict free designations.

Through our due diligence process, which aligns with guidance from the Organisation for Economic Co Operation and Development, we received 100% participation from our in scope private brands and proprietary product Tier 1 suppliers.

Sixty two percent of our in scope Tier 1 suppliers indicated that one or more conflict minerals were necessary to the functionality or production of covered products, up from 32% in 2020.

Of the smelters or refiners reported by these suppliers, only 48 out of a total of 311 uniquely identified smelters or refiners sourced conflict minerals from covered countries.

Forty three of these smelters or refiners were certified as DRC conflict free by the Responsible Minerals Initiative, the London Bullion Market Association and or the Responsible Jewellery Council.

We continue to work closely with our suppliers to ensure they implement responsible sourcing obtain current, accurate and complete information about the supply chain and encourage their smelters to obtain a conflict free designation from an independent third party auditor.

Our company expects all suppliers that manufacture our products to provide appropriate information and conduct due diligence to enable our compliance with conflict minerals laws.

We also expect these manufacturers to obtain products and materials from suppliers that are not involved in funding conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining covered countries.

We partner with our private brands and proprietary product suppliers whose products contain tin, tungsten, tantalum or gold (referred to as 3TG) to identify the source of any of these minerals in the supply chain.

We cataloged that information in a database using the conflict minerals reporting template developed by the Responsible Minerals Initiative .

We report this data for the calendar year, rather than our fiscal year, in line with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules.

Our in scope Tier 1 suppliers decreased to 21 in 2021 from 91 in 2020 and from 71 in 2019.

In 2021, as part of our annual assessment of products in scope, we continued to exclude any supplier of products where the supplier merely affixed company brands, trademarks, logos or labels to generic products manufactured by a third party, as permitted by SEC guidance.

We strive to create transparency in how global forest resources are used in our products.

We continually work with stakeholders to promote sustainable forestry around the globe.

Continuing to avoid areas of deforestation and conversion of natural ecosystems in our supply chain.

Engaging in a multiple stakeholder dialogue to develop a Canadian forest procurement framework.

Supporting the continual dialogue around the development of jurisdictional landscape.

We believe that this approach, although complex, could contain the core foundation to aligning multiple stakeholders with community interests, like responsible commodity production, improved economic growth, and human wellbeing opportunities.

Development of this approach has the potential to promote sustained community growth while protecting a region’s natural resource base.

The Home Depot’s focus on selling products made from sustainable sources of wood dates to 1994, when certified sustainable wood shelving first arrived in our aisles.

We recognize the environmental impact our company can have on the world’s woodlands by working with suppliers that adhere to set standards of forest management and tree species selection.

To help protect endangered forests and support efforts to preserve timber for future generations, we first issued our Wood Purchasing Policy in 1999.

Since then, we have continued to update this policy, and have worked to lead our suppliers to understanding and practicing sustainable forestry throughout the world.

We know that responsible forest management is essential to protecting the health of our ecosystems, critical biodiversity and the more than one billion people who depend on forests for their livelihoods.

The goal of our sustainable forestry efforts is to ensure timber and healthy forests remain available for future generations.

We are proud of our ability to create positive change by encouraging sustainable forestry practices.

We strive to better understand the social and economic effects that wood purchases have around the world, especially in regions with endangered forests.

Over the years, we have focused our efforts to ensure the protection of forests at highest risk.

While we sell less than 2% of the roundwood cut worldwide, we believe our efforts have had an outsized impact on the industry.

We source approximately 86% from North America, approximately 8% from South America, approximately 3% from Asia, and less than 1% from each of Europe, Africa, and Oceania.

We believe that through our ongoing work with suppliers to sustainably manage forests and the commitments listed in our Wood Purchasing Policy, we have helped to expand forest land coverage in North America.

Through the sharing of best practices with suppliers and ongoing engagement with stakeholders, we seek to build upon the progress we’ve made to protect the world’s forests.

The positive impact of our work with suppliers can be seen in our results.

We also source lumber from a number of the largest forestry companies in North America, which work with sustainable forest management organizations like Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI), Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), and American Tree Farm to ensure their trees are being sourced sustainably.

Suppliers of ours like Mendocino Redwood Company (MRC ) and Humboldt Redwood Company (HRC ) seek to be examples of forest restoration and show how private forest management can protect and restore the ecological attributes of the forest, and whose forestlands are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) as being well managed forests.

While we are proud of the progress we have made to promote sustainable forestry, we continue to assess opportunities to drive progress in this area.

To further our commitment to sustainable forestry and increased transparency, we recently committed to participating in the CDP forests questionnaire.

Data Driven Sourcing Understanding the world’s forest coverage by country helps guide our supply chain decisions.

The vast majority of our wood product purchases originate from North America.

Seventeen percent of the world’s forests are in Canada and the United States, according to research by the United Nations Food Agriculture Organization.

The U.N.’s 2020 State of the World’s Forests report shows that more than half of the world’s forest coverage is in five countries: Russia (20%), Brazil (12%), Canada (9%), the U.S. (8%) and China (5%).

Give preference to the purchase of wood and wood products originating from certified, well managed forests wherever feasible.

Eliminate the purchase of wood and wood products from forest regions identified as endangered.

Practice and promote the efficient and responsible use of wood and wood products.

Promote and support the development and use of alternative environmental products.

Congo Basin areas, Papua New Guinea or the Solomon Islands, unless they’re Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified.

Demand that our vendors and their suppliers of wood and wood products maintain compliance with laws and regulations pertaining to their operations and the products they manufacture.

Visit the Sustainable Forestry page of our Eco Actions website to learn more about our initiatives to protect the world’s forests and how we work with suppliers to create high standards for forest management.

Our greatest environmental impact comes from the products we sell, and our biggest opportunity to create change is helping customers live more sustainably.

The Home Depot’s Eco Options program continues to help our customers identify products that have less of an impact on the environment and encourages our suppliers to provide more sustainable offerings.

We launched Eco Options in 2007 in partnership with SCS Global Services, a leading, independent, third party certification body that validates environmental claims.

For a product to receive Eco Options classification, the supplier must document attributes that prove it has less of an impact on the environment than comparable products in the same category.

Until all industries create and abide by a reporting formula that measures product attributes according to a common sustainability standard, we will continue to use our Eco Options program to help customers sort through green product claims.

We continue to look for ways to help our customers reduce their environmental impact through the projects they take on.

Building on the progress we’ve made with our Eco Options program, in April 2021 we launched our new Eco Actions program, which provides our customers with the resources they need to take individual action on environmental issues.

Our Eco Actions website provides customers with new content, insights and ideas from innovative partners to inspire sustainable action.

Reducing emissions with battery powered outdoor equipment.

Eco Actions is just another way we’re helping our customers make sustainable changes for the better by helping them create greener homes.

Our new Eco Actions website offers insights and ideas on how people can do their part in their homes and gardens to create meaningful change.

In addition to our Eco Options and Eco Actions programs, we focus our sustainable product efforts in two key areas relevant to our business: forestry and indoor air quality.

In 1999, we established a Wood Purchasing Policy to help avoid wood products coming from forestland with a high conservation value.

Since then, we have continued to update this policy, and have worked to lead our suppliers to understanding and practicing sustainable forestry throughout the world.

And in 2017, we published our Chemical Strategy (see Page 46) to encourage the exclusion of certain chemicals from paint, flooring, insulation, household cleaning and paint removers.

Our chemical strategy is an important part of our commitment to offer greener products.

The Home Depot was honored with four Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Awards in 2021.

These awards reflect our commitment to sustainable business practices.

We are proud to serve as industry leaders in the design, manufacture, selection, and use of products that are safer for the environment.

Our Eco Actions website makes it easier for customers to identify products that can help reduce their households’ impact on the climate, the planet and natural resources.

Discover a few products in the program below, and learn more about our greener products on Page 42.

The Home Depot works to help the industry change the way it thinks about materials.

We encourage supplier innovation in product and packaging design, material selection and manufacturing, as well as striving to produce products that have positive environmental impact during use.

Since we introduced Circularity as one of our Eco Options’ pillars in 2019, our focus has been to prevent products and packaging from becoming waste throughout the product lifecycle.

The foundation of Circularity comes from nature: nothing is wasted, and everything is regenerative.

We strive to offer products with a positive environmental impact, and we encourage suppliers to innovate in how they produce and package products for reuse and longevity.

We carry millions of products, and many have the potential to move our economy toward circularity.

We also look for opportunities within Home Depot operations to reduce, repair, reuse and recycle.

The goal is to extend our planet’s natural resources and protect land and water from the impact of material disposal.

RECYCLE by separating and collecting raw materials from our own waste streams, and working with our suppliers to turn them into new products.

Eliminate materials that are not readily reusable or recyclable.

Minimize mixed materials to enable simpler disassembly and recycling.

Utilize materials that are biodegradable or readily recyclable.

Utilize recycled content, when possible, without compromising product efficacy.

Promote minimization of environmental impact in manufacturing and consumer use.

See how The Home Depot partners with Nike to move towards a circular future in which the very concept of waste doesn’t exist.

Nike Grind diverts shoes and material waste away from landfills and transforms them into a variety of new products, including carpet cushions and gym flooring tiles sold at The Home Depot.

See how we’re recycling would be waste into useful products over and over again.

Supplier Pratt Industries produces all Home Depot moving boxes, made from 100% recycled material.

We collect used cardboard, paper and other recyclable bers and send them to Pratt.

Our operations and our customers provide used boxes for recycling, and the process begins again.

Pratt separates and compresses the bers at a materials recovery facility.

Customers purchase millions of our THD branded moving boxes every year.

The next stop is a paper mill, where bers are cleaned and pressed into strong, exible paper.

Boxes are distributed through our supply chain to stock stores and ful ll online orders.

At a corrugating plant, layers of paper are crimped and glued together to create sheets of cardboard.

At a Pratt converting facility, cardboard sheets are cut into boxes printed with our logo.

We’re addressing chemicals of concerns in our products and providing transparency into our approach in our regularly updated Chemical Strategy.

The Home Depot vinyl flooring suppliers are setting the pace for change in this category with efforts to continually improve the chemical profile of their products.

As of January 2016, no ortho phthalates are permitted as added plasticizers in vinyl flooring sold in Home Depot stores in the U.S. and Canada.

Laminate flooring in Home Depot stores is verified by either GREENGUARD Gold or FloorScore certification to contain 0.0073 ppm or less of formaldehyde, which is a stricter standard than CARB 2 of 0.05 ppm.

At The Home Depot, we recognize the opportunity we have for the environmental impact of our organization, and that our biggest impact is the products we sell.

In partnership with stakeholders throughout the supply chain, we are committed to offering products that are safer for the environment and our customers.

With our encouragement, our suppliers have been investing in developing environmentally innovative products.

The Home Depot supports the work of the Green Chemistry Commerce Council (GC3) through annual membership and participation in the Retail Leadership Council of the GC3, and we participated in developing the GC3’s Joint Statement on using Green Chemistry and Safer Alternatives to Advance Sustainable Products.

We and many of our suppliers also partner with respected third party certification organizations and environmental non profits that guide the home improvement industry toward safer chemical ingredient use.

The Home Depot is committed to continuing the drive toward minimizing the environmental impact of the products we sell.

The Home Depot is committed to increasing our assortment of products that maintain third party certifications of their chemical ingredients, and that meet high environmental standards.

The Home Depot works with many suppliers in efforts to improve chemicals in categories with the greatest potential impact on indoor air quality.

We encourage our suppliers to continually review key categories to track progress on environmental innovations in green chemistry.

The Home Depot will evaluate this strategy annually to ensure our approach, goals and disclosure are appropriate and meet the needs of our stakeholders.

Paints Our paint suppliers have taken efforts over the last ten years to evolve their paints and offer products that help maintain air quality.

Triclosan Isocyanates Formaldehyde Lead heavy metals Alkylphenol ethoxylates and Nonylphenol ethoxylates (APEOs and NPEs).

Certifications: In our U.S. stores, all Behr interior paints, Glidden Premium, Glidden Diamond and PPG Timeless interior paints are GREENGUARD Gold certified.

Paint tinting Colorants: In 2012, we transitioned our paint tinting colorants in our U.S. and Canada stores from solvent based formulation to a water based, low VOC and ethylene glycol free formulation.

Volatile Organic Compounds: All of our interior and exterior latex water based wall paints in our U.S. and Canada stores are zero or low VOC.

Removing paints and varnishes safely and efficiently is an important step in many home improvement painting and staining projects.

Methylene chloride has historically been the most effective product option in this category.

Note: Colorants added to base paints may increase VOC level, depending on color choice.

Customers who use our energy saving products reduce their power bills and their impact on the planet.

The Home Depot encourages suppliers to make the products we sell more energy efficient, and our partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star program supports those efforts, too.

In 2021, we helped our customers save 1.5 billion on utility bills through the purchase and proper use of energy efficient products.

Energy Star labeled products were key to that progress.

In 2021, we offered over 22,000 energy saving products in stores and online, including more than 15,000 Energy Star products.

We sold more than 200 million units of Energy Star products.

We estimate our customers’ purchases of Energy Star products in 2021 helped reduce annual electricity use by 7 billion kilowatt hours, saving 950 million on energy costs and lowering carbon emissions by 4.9 million metric tons.

The Home Depot U.S. is a 12 time Energy Star award winner and our Canadian stores were recognized for the eighth year in a row as the ENERGY STAR Canada Retailer of the Year in 2021.

See how our Canadian division is improving sustainability on Page 71.

Energy Star labeled clothes dryers use 20% less electricity.

If all clothes dryers sold in the U.S. were Energy Star certified, Americans could collectively save more than 1.5 billion each year in utility costs and prevent greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to those from more than 2 million vehicles.

Clothes washers use about 25% less energy and 33% less water when they’re Energy Star certified.

The Home Depot helps protect water resources nationwide by selling products designed to conserve.

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, we work with suppliers to encourage the production of water conserving products, which we, in turn, offer to our customers.

Our greatest opportunity to effect environmental change for the better is by selling eco friendly products that help drive efficient use of resources in communities we serve.

In 2021, we continued to help our customers conserve water in their homes and businesses.

Across our stores and online, we offered more than 8,000 water saving products, including more than 5,000 products bearing the EPA’s WaterSense label, and we sold nearly 21 million units of those WaterSense products.

We estimate our customers’ purchases of WaterSense products in 2021 helped reduce annual water consumption by over 66 billion gallons, which would collectively mean savings of more than 873 million on water bills.

The EPA estimates that household leaks can add up to nearly 1 trillion gallons of water lost every year.

Fixing these leaks conserves water and can also reduce utility bills by about 10%.

We provide project guides on our Eco Actions website to help educate customers on fixing or replacing leaky faucets.

Our company has been a WaterSense Partner of the Year eight times since 2011, receiving the Sustained Excellence awards in three of those years.

The average family in the U.S. could save 2,700 gallons of water per year by installing WaterSense labeled showerheads.

Replacing old, inefficient faucets and aerators with WaterSense labeled models can save the average family 700 gallons of water per year, equal to the amount of water needed to take 45 showers.

Toilets account for nearly 30% of an average home’s water use.

Replacing old toilets with WaterSense models can save nearly 13,000 gallons a year.

Our partnerships with local growers enable us to offer healthy, environmentally beneficial plants, reduce emissions and support businesses in the communities we serve.

Our growers work closely with U.S. states’ departments of agriculture to identify invasive plants that may threaten local native plants.

We are proud to partner with more than 135 plant growers who balance the impact of their production with local environmental issues and growing conditions in their regions.

The Home Depot partners with our growers and suppliers in advance of each growing season to offer healthy trees, blooms and edible plants that support local environments and pollinators.

Cleaning products have an important impact on the environment inside homes and beyond.

We are committed to partnering with suppliers that allow us to increase our customers’ eco friendly cleaning options.

The Clorox Company was named the 2021 Safer Choice Partner of the Year award winner for outstanding achievement in the manufacturing of products with ingredients that are safer for families, pets, workplaces, communities, and the environment.

We partner with vendors to keep improving how we and our customers reduce, reuse and recycle.

Hazardous Materials Disposal Handling We seek sustainable methods of disposal, and, in 2021, our company recycled or reused for energy 30% of the hazardous waste generated from our operations and customer returns.

Associates receive training on recognizing hazardous materials.

Associates responsible for managing storage and cleanup of hazardous materials complete additional in depth environmental compliance training.

Information about and guidance for the cleanup, classification, labeling and storage of hazardous waste is available to associates through company issued handheld devices and our associate intranet site.

In the U.S., The Home Depot provided over 5.4 million pounds of shredded paper for recycling in 2021.

We recycle lead acid batteries used in THD operations and dropped off by customers.

The amount of cardboard we recycle from our operations continues to rise.

Customers’ switch to LED lights has reduced CFL recycling volume.

We recycle rechargeable batteries dropped off by customers.

Our packaging innovations reduce waste, increase shipping efficiency and decrease product damage.

The Home Depot’s packaging team works with our private label product suppliers to apply science to creating better packaging.

Our goal is to reduce package footprints and use more sustainable materials to secure and protect the private label products we sell.

From 2017 through 2021, our packaging innovations allowed us to redesign 652 packages to reduce size and materials.

In 2021, our packaging team continued to innovate as they undertook a large project aimed at reducing packaging across our Crown Bolt products, Home Depot’s private brand of fasteners and building hardware.

This project touched over 16 million packaging units, across nearly 300 SKUs.

In 2021, our packaging team continued to find substitutes for expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film in our private label products.

EPS foam is good at protecting products from damage, but it contains beads of chemicals and oil that are often difficult to recycle and can take more than a century to biodegrade.

We continue to look across our private label products to find even the smallest amounts of EPS and replace it with easier to recycle materials like molded pulp and paper.

PVC film is a thin, rigid synthetic plastic polymer that’s molded around products to secure and protect them.

But, like EPS, it is tough to recycle and takes a long time to break down naturally, and we’re working hard to use less of it.

In 2020, we committed to eliminating EPS foam and PVC film from our private label packages by 2023, prompting us to dig even deeper for results.

We’re compressing EPS waste from our operations into foam blocks that can be repurposed into new products, such as insulation keeping the material out of landfills.

Meet the entrepreneurial associate who launched this initiative.

Our practice of engaging with our stakeholders on ESG topics helped us design a more sustainable packaging solution for some of our LED lightbulbs.

In response to customer feedback, we have sought to remove the excess plastic from our ECOSMART LED bulb packaging.

In this regard, our packaging team went to work looking for a new way to package the bulbs without the need for plastic.

The redesign that our packaging team came up with helped eliminate the need for plastic in the packaging, while also reducing the size of the box.

Our core values shape our commitment to making the communities we serve stronger and more resilient.

By supporting diversity in our communities and among our suppliers, we encourage respect for all people and spark entrepreneurship and innovation.

In 2021, we spent 3.3 billion with diverse suppliers, compared to 3.2 billion the previous year.

Diverse businesses are identified as U.S. based, for profit and 51% or more owned, controlled and operated by U.S. citizens or people with U.S. permanent resident alien status that fall under one of the following categories: woman, ethnic minority, veteran, LGBTQ, individuals with a disability.

In 2021, we launched a Tier II supplier diversity program designed to drive more spending from our direct Tier I suppliers to diverse businesses.

We’re working to better ensure that a portion of the money we spend on products and services, even with suppliers that are not identified as diverse, makes its way to diverse enterprises.

The Home Depot provides supplier development programs and mentoring to assist diverse suppliers with business growth, and we partner with organizations that provide certification, education and opportunities for capital and networking.

In celebration of Giving Tuesday, The Home Depot Foundation surprised six nonprofit organizations with 30,000 of unrestricted funds totaling 180,000.

Beyond of the Foundation’s efforts to train skilled tradespeople, The Home Depot also provides a Path to Pro Skills Program where individuals can prepare for a career in the trades.

With more than 40% of the construction workforce set to retire in the next decade, The Home Depot is dedicated to helping build the next generation of trades professionals and connecting those trades people with Pros in need of skilled labor to keep their businesses running.

Through the Path to Pro program, The Home Depot has built a website of trade resources, developed a free training program for those interested in building a career in the skilled trades, and launched an exclusive trades career networking platform for candidates to connect with hiring Pro Xtra members.

PathtoPro.com launched in July of 2021 and serves student, parent, advisor, military, and pro audiences by providing consolidated resources on the skilled trades.

The site includes a resource library with downloadable PDFs and video content to help individuals better understand the career potential in the trades industry, offers training opportunities, and acts as a K 12 trades education platform that can help guide graduating seniors in understanding how to build a career in the skilled trades.

The plan, outlined in 2015, focuses on 17 areas in which nations, governments, businesses and citizens can work to achieve measurable results by 2030.

The Home Depot shares many of the same goals, which are articulated in our core values.

Good Health and Well Being We transitioned our COVID related enhanced associate pay and benefits to permanent compensation enhancements for front line, hourly associates. (Page 25).

We offer a range of healthy life benefits at no cost to associates. (Page 28).

The Home Depot’s Eco Options Eco Actions program identifies environmentally preferred products. (Page 42).

Gender Equality We strive for a fair workplace that removes bias and provides women and associates from underrepresented minority groups access to resources they need to succeed at work. (Page 19).

Our Women’s Link associate resource group promotes professional development for women associates across our organization. (Page 26).

Clean Water and Sanitation In U.S. stores, we offer bathroom vanity faucets and toilets for sale that bear the U.S. EPA’s WaterSense label.

Our store merchandised showerheads are more efficient than the WaterSense standard.

We estimate that our customers saved over 66 billion gallons of water in 2021 by properly using our water saving products. (Page 49).

In 2021, we had smart irrigation systems at 503 U.S. stores.

On average, there is an approximately 29% reduction in water used, compared to traditional systems.

Affordable and Clean Energy At the end of fiscal year 2021, we were operating rooftop solar farms atop 76 U.S. stores and leveraging fuel cell generated power at 205 U.S. stores. (Page 36).

Through our expanded wind and solar farm partnerships, we expect to purchase enough electricity to power the equivalent of more than 500 Home Depot stores. (Page 35).

Our partnership with the EPA’s Energy Star program in 2021 enabled customers to purchase products capable of reducing their electricity use by 7 billion kilowatt hours, saving 950 million on energy costs. (Page 48).

Decent Work and Economic Growth We employ approximately 500,000 associates internationally, and our supply chain has an economic impact on millions of workers globally. (Page 5).

Sustainable Cities and Communities By the end of fiscal year 2021, The Home Depot Foundation had invested over 400 million in veteran causes. (Page 64).

Approximately 90% of our U.S. store leaders started.

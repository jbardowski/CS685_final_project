A letter from the Chief Executive Officer 

I’m pleased to share Wells Fargo’s latest Sustainability & Governance Report. In this report, you’ll find an 
overview of the work we are doing to build a sustainable, inclusive future in the communities we serve. These 
efforts span housing affordability, small business growth, financial inclusion, sustainability, and other initiatives. 
Making a difference in these areas requires a sustained effort, and we are committed to this work for 
the long-term. 

As a company, we are balanced in our approach to environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, issues, and 
we recognize that consumers and businesses want to do business with a company that has a strong reputation. 
A strong reputation is achieved not just from strong financial performance, but from actively supporting 
employees, customers, and communities – especially those most in need. As I look back at 2022, I’m proud of 
the progress we’ve made on these priorities, and I feel even better about the opportunities ahead. 

I hope you enjoy reading about our progress and where we’re focused in the pages to follow.

Foreword by the 
Chief Sustainability Officer 

Nothing in the banking industry stands still, and Wells Fargo’s journey in sustainability is further proof of this. 
We established sustainability goals in 2021 and this past year, we continued our progress toward these goals. 
Along the way, we uncovered opportunities, established a framework of impact areas, and enhanced 
governance to sustain momentum. This year’s report illustrates our accomplishments and continued path 
forward. 

Progress toward goals 
Our goal to deploy $500 billion in sustainable finance by 2030 is well underway. In the first two years of 
tracking, we've originated, committed, advised, or facilitated approximately $129 billion, funding a growing 
demand for products and services that are building the low-carbon economy and strengthening community 
resilience. In addition, since announcing in March of 2021 our goal of net-zero greenhouse gas, or GHG, 
emissions by 2050, including financed emissions, Wells Fargo has taken meaningful steps forward. Across our 
footprint, we are working to minimize use of energy, water, and other resources, reduce GHG emissions in our 
operations, and have set refreshed operational sustainability goals for 2023. And we set interim emissions-
based targets to guide the alignment of our financing portfolios with our net-zero goal. 

Impact area framework 
After establishing our sustainability goals in 2021, we saw a need and an opportunity to establish a framework 
around the areas where Wells Fargo can create the greatest impact. The framework serves as a way to align 
and prioritize our collective efforts. Wells Fargo reviewed its business profile, competitive position, client base, 
and footprint. These elements were mapped alongside the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, as 
well as global challenges and opportunities related to sustainability and stakeholder expectations. Our analysis 
included significant external factors, such as geopolitical impacts on global energy needs and new U.S. 
incentives for clean energy manufacturing, that are expected to reshape several industries. 

This assessment helped us identify several cross-cutting sustainability impact areas where we can best apply 
our expertise, size, and scale to make a positive difference. They highlight opportunities to collaborate across 
our own operations and with strategic community impact organizations. These areas include:

Underlying our sustainability impact areas, we maintain a focus on vulnerable communities’ access to the 
opportunities associated with a transition to a low-carbon economy. 

By aligning our sustainability efforts with the framework, we believe we can make an effective impact within 
Wells Fargo and with our stakeholders. We’ve used it to share our progress in the first part of this report. 

Governance 
This report also includes details on employee support and corporate governance. Effective governance helps 
ensure that Wells Fargo is managed responsibly, incorporating appropriate oversight and risk management 
aimed at creating long-term value for shareholders. 

The following report is a snapshot of our sustainability journey, which is a path that supports our business, 
customers, and communities' transition to a resilient, equitable, and sustainable future.

Support financial health 

Wells Fargo’s approach to helping transform and improve the financial health of our communities is a key 
component of our focus on social impact. We have made long-term philanthropic and commercial investments 
in low- to moderate-income communities to help move individuals from financially vulnerable positions to 
positions of better financial health, where they have improved financial security and freedom of choice now and 
in the future. We collaborate with key industry and community groups to practice healthy financial living for the 
long term. 

As part of Wells Fargo’s focus on building an inclusive economy where people have equitable access to 
economic opportunity, we provide a variety of resources and products to enable individuals to increase their 
savings, reduce debt, secure healthy credit, and acquire assets in pursuit of their financial goals. Many of these 
resources are available through the Financial Health hub. Examples of our commitment to supporting financial 
health include the following programs and initiatives. 

•  Hands on Banking® is Wells Fargo’s free financial education program intended to teach money 

management skills for all life stages, where users can learn at their own pace. The program provides tools 
to help teachers and nonprofit financial counselors. In support of this initiative, Wells Fargo employee 
volunteers deliver financial education in schools and communities. 

•  Our Debt-to-Income Ratio Calculator allows users to enter income and debt payments, then helps them 

understand more about what that ratio can mean in their financial health journey. 

•  CollegeSTEPS® was created by Wells Fargo to help college students manage their money. Through this 

website, college students and recent graduates can access free guidance and resources on relevant topics, 
such as paying for college, finding scholarships, understanding credit, managing money, and preparing for 
the next steps in their financial journey after college. 

•  Wells Fargo AssistSM offers a variety of options and support to customers facing financial hardship related 

to credit cards, home loans, other loans, and other accounts. 

•  Our Credit Close-UpSM tool provides personalized tips to help customers manage their FICO® Scores and 
has been leveraged by over 11 million customers. As part of our efforts to support customers on their 
journey to financial health, Wells Fargo provides customers with free access to their FICO Scores. As shown 
in the table below, in 2022 we helped over 11 million customers access their FICO Scores.

Wells Fargo provides products and services that give our customers choice and flexibility in meeting their 
financial health needs and tools to help manage their accounts. Online, mobile, and text banking tools allow 
customers to monitor account activity, transfer funds, and help avoid overdrafts. Services include automatic 
zero-balance alerts that notify online banking customers by email if their account balances drop to zero or 
below. 

In addition, we made several changes in 2022 to help millions of customers avoid overdraft fees and meet 
short-term cash needs. These efforts included: 

•  Elimination of Overdraft Protection fund transfers fees and nonsufficient funds fees. 

•  Early Pay Day makes eligible direct deposits available up to two days early. 

•  Extra Day Grace gives customers an extra business day to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees. 

•  Flex Loan is a new digital-only, small-dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and 

affordable access to funds. 

The above actions build on services Wells Fargo has introduced over the past several years, including Clear 
Access Banking, a consumer banking account with no overdraft fees. As of year-end 2022, we now have over 
1.7 million of those accounts, up 48% from a year ago.

Inclusion Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website. 

Banking Inclusion Initiative 

Wells Fargo’s Banking Inclusion Initiative, launched in 2021, is a 10-year commitment to help more people who 
are unbanked gain access to affordable, mainstream accounts and provide easier access to financial education 
and guidance. In low- to moderate-income community census tracts, we’ve introduced Community 
Connections Branches designed around the needs of the diverse communities we serve. Starting in 2022, in 
designated branches, we redesigned spaces created to deliver one-on-one consultations, improve digital 
access, and offer financial health seminars. 
Also, as part of the Banking Inclusion Initiative, we announced our collaboration with Operation HOPE4 to 
launch HOPE Inside centers (which feature Operation HOPE financial coaches) within diverse and low- to 
moderate-income neighborhoods. 

“You have no idea how relieved I feel. I felt stuck and I hated living paycheck to 
paycheck. I finally feel like I am able to afford a savings account, and I always hear your 
voice in the back of my head before I spend a dollar telling me, 'Do you really need it, if 
your life doesn’t depend on it, I don’t know why you’re buying it. You’re setting 
yourself up,' and she’s right, I was setting myself up for financial stress. I am finally 
ready to build my wealth.” 
— Financial Coaching Client of Alejandra Lozano, HOPE Inside Financial 

Well-being Coach (Wells Fargo HOPE Inside Los Angeles) 

More information about our impact in 2022 can be found on our Banking Inclusion Initiative website and in our 
annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website. 

4 Operation HOPE is a 501(c)(3) organization that helps individuals of all ages by offering financial education, one-on-one coaching, courses on credit score improvement, as well as pathways toward homeownership and starting a business.

Philanthropic programs enabling financial inclusion5

The Wells Fargo Financial Capability Grant Program focuses on helping low- to moderate-income populations 
set their own financial goals, build savings, reduce debt, acquire financial assets, and establish or improve their 
credit through one-on-one financial coaching and counseling. In 2022, we invested $5.4 million in this program 
across a variety of agencies, including the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, International Rescue 
Committee, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, or LISC, and others. In 2022, our investments in this 
program helped individuals save $14.1 million and reduce debt by $17.4 million, assisted over 9,500 people in 
establishing or increasing their credit score, and supported more than 9,800 individuals in acquiring financial 
assets. 

Local Initiatives Support Corporation testimonials 

Keyonna, mother of two, used LISC’s Twin Accounts tool to build credit and save money at the same time. With assistance from 
her Financial Opportunity Center coach at HumanKind, a LISC partner in Richmond, Virginia, supported by Wells Fargo, Keyonna 
was able to follow a savings plan, pay off her car loan, and build a brighter financial outlook for her family. 

“It is the most amazing sensation, knowing homeownership will be possible,” shared Edith, who once believed her dream of 
becoming a homeowner might be out of reach. Thanks to her hard work and guidance from coaches at The Alliance TX, a LISC 
partner in Houston, this dream is becoming a reality. Edith built both her credit and savings through engaging in this program.

Helping people through our Credit Building Grant Program6

Wells Fargo’s Credit Building Grant Program works with nonprofit lenders with a focus on small-dollar, credit-
building loans, rent reporting, credit education, and credit rehabilitation to help low- to moderate-income 
people establish or build their credit successfully to ultimately grow savings and reduce debt. In 2022, we 
enabled individuals to reduce debt by $10.1 million and helped 10,500 people establish or increase their credit 
score. A key partner in this program, Grameen America, serves diverse women entrepreneurs through 
microloans that help women business owners establish or increase their credit. 

One recipient of the Credit Building Grant Program in partnership with Grameen America is Meregilda, who 
came to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic. After moving to Brooklyn over 25 years ago, Meregilda opened 
a restaurant to share her love of traditional Latin dishes from the Caribbean. 

Meregilda has been a Grameen America member since 2014. She’s proud of the growth she’s seen in both her 
credit score and her business after multiple loan cycles. To date, Grameen America has provided over $35,000 
to Meregilda’s restaurant through 13 microloans. Meregilda hopes to leverage her savings and good credit to 
open a second restaurant in Staten Island. 

“With my loans, I have been able to pay the salaries of new employees, which has 
allowed me to bring on the extra help I needed at the restaurant. My credit score is 
better than it has ever been.” 
– Meregilda, Credit Building Grant Program recipient

Partnering with the International Rescue Committee 

In collaboration with the International Rescue Committee, or IRC, Wells Fargo supports immigrants and 
refugees newly settled in the U.S. as they navigate the U.S. banking system. Wells Fargo provides funding for 
the IRC's financial coaching and lending (credit building loan) programs. The staff at the IRC speaks multiple 
languages to provide financial coaching and counseling to immigrants and refugees from around the world. The 
organization also provides access to certain financial products, including a credit building ladder loan to help 
new citizens build their credit for the first time. 

In 2021, Inam arrived in Baltimore, Maryland, from Pakistan. Inam attended credit information sessions offered 
through IRC Baltimore's financial capabilities program and signed up for an IRC credit building loan. Inam and 
his financial coach met several times to devise a plan to pay down his credit card debt. Inam bought a truck in 
March 2022, about one year after arriving in the U.S. Using it to transport himself and his tools, he has built a 
successful contracting business and can now employ two other builders. Inam also used his extra income to 
clear his debts, and with help from his credit-building loan, he has gone from having a "poor" to an "excellent" 
credit ranking in under one year. 

Supporting the Bank On program 

Wells Fargo supports the Bank On program, which is led by the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund. This 
organization educates unbanked Americans about the benefits of having a bank account and connects 
consumers to affordable accounts without common barriers, like overdraft fees. Wells Fargo funds the Bank 
On program both nationally and locally and provides local engagement and expertise to coalitions in regions 
across the country to pilot new strategies and approaches that help overcome barriers to banking access in 
several markets with high concentrations of unbanked households. This, in turn, helps develop a more seamless 
path for unbanked communities to navigate the traditional banking system.

Promote housing access and affordability 

Wells Fargo is working to increase access to quality, affordable places to live, especially for individuals and 
families historically excluded from the housing market. 

Since the beginning of 2019, we have donated more than $525 million to help support available and affordable 
rentals, homeownership, and housing stability. 

Additionally in 2022, Wells Fargo announced an expansion of its Dream.Plan.Home closing cost credit, which 
provides borrowers with an income at or below 80% of the median income in the area where the property is 
located up to $5,000 to use toward closing costs. The credit is available in certain counties within 20 markets. 

Another Wells Fargo program is Wealth Opportunities Realized Through Homeownership, or WORTH, a $60 
million national philanthropy effort to address systemic barriers to homeownership for people of color. 
Nationally, WORTH aims to help 40,000 new homeowners of color in eight markets by the end of 2025. 
Additionally, the Wells Fargo Foundation announced a $40 million Growing Diverse Housing Developers 
initiative focused on expanding the growth and success of real estate developers of color, including Black- and 
Latino-owned firms. 

More information about our commitment to housing affordability and opening new pathways to housing is 
available in our annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting 
website.

Develop small business growth 

Small businesses strengthen communities, drive economies, and provide millions of jobs across the U.S. Wells 
Fargo is committed to supporting small businesses and providing access to capital that can help them turn 
entrepreneurial dreams into successful realities. 

Our goal is to be the bank of choice for all small businesses. To advance that goal, we develop deep 
relationships and personalized solutions for the small businesses we serve today and catalyze philanthropic 
programs to help enable equitable access to capital for diverse- and women-owned small businesses. 

Open for Business Fund meets the needs of diverse business owners7

Launched in 2020, the multiyear Open for Business Fund, or OFB, delivered approximately $420 million in 
grants to nonprofits focused on serving small businesses at the community level, with an emphasis on meeting 
the specific needs of diverse small business owners. Funded organizations deeply understand the 
circumstances and needs of small businesses in their communities, and were able to leverage their OFB grants 
to raise a total of $1.8 billion in grants and debt to meet demands for affordable financial services and technical 
support for small businesses. 

Between 2020 and the end of 2022, OFB grant recipients have supported over 188,000 small businesses that 
provide nearly 236,000 jobs. Approximately 79% of these went to diverse-owned small businesses. 

Que Bonito Mexican and Fashion in Houston is one example of a small business that received critical support. 
When the owner, Diana, wanted to grow her business, she joined the Open for Business for Women 
Entrepreneurs program, led by the Houston Community College Office of Entrepreneurial Initiatives in 
partnership with the Houston Mexican Consulate, and funded by the OFB. 

“It was a blessing,” Diana said about the knowledge she gained that helped her grow 
her business. “For me, it’s not a new beginning, but having the confidence to go to the 
next level. Being a small business owner means freedom.”

Making connections through the Small Business Resource Navigator 

In 2022, Wells Fargo announced the Small Business Resource Navigator, an online portal helping connect small 
business owners to potential financing options and technical assistance through Community Development 
Financial Institutions across the U.S. The portal was launched in collaboration with the nonprofit Community 
Reinvestment Fund, USA and was made possible by a Wells Fargo OFB grant. Since its launch, the Small 
Business Resource Navigator has introduced nearly 1,200 small businesses, a majority of which self-identify as 
diverse, to potential credit opportunities and technical assistance services provided by Community 
Development Financial Institutions. 

This online tool is designed to simplify and streamline the capital process for time-strapped entrepreneurs, 
helping them quickly and effectively identify their best options. By visiting bizresourcenavigator.com9 and 
completing a short questionnaire, business owners can connect to relevant Community Development Financial 
Institutions or business advisory resources in their area. 

8 OFB grant recipients report on cumulative impact data for up to three years following receipt of an OFB grant. Impact data will continue to be tracked through early 2025.

Supporting women-owned businesses with Connect to More℠ 

Wells Fargo increased our support for women-owned businesses, announcing plans to provide mentorship 
opportunities for 1,000 women in 2022 through our Connect to More℠ program. Developed in partnership 
with the Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center, this initiative provides women entrepreneurs with complimentary 
access to the Center’s signature 12-week Milestone Circles10 mentorship program where they collectively 
received roughly 13,000 hours of mentorship support. Connect to MoreSM participants reported tremendous 
benefits as a result of the program. More information about supporting women-owned businesses is available 
at Wells Fargo's Connect to More for Women Entrepreneurs site and in our annual Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website. 

“Through my 12 weeks in the Milestone Circles program, I was able to document a lot 
of processes and standard operating procedures that enabled me to onboard four 
new team members and step out of being directly involved in every single client 
deliverable. This has allowed me to scale my business from $9,000 in revenue to 
$20,000+ in revenue monthly and to a team of 11 amazing humans.” 
– Rachel Pereyra, owner of Mastermind Business Services 

“The Milestone Circles program really blew me away with its approach to bridging 
‘vision’ with ‘goals.’ The team created an environment for success with exercises that 
challenged me to really dig deep into our vision, which opened up so many 
opportunities. I was able to clearly consider our desired funding journey and received 
expert feedback from mentors. As a result, our company has identified funding

Scale clean energy 

Wells Fargo believes there is a path forward in the transition to clean energy, which will take time, 
commitment, and capital to pave. We are a leading capital provider for the clean energy economy, supporting 
manufacturing and deployment of key technologies like solar and wind power. Our finance and tax equity 
teams support projects ranging from residential rooftop solar to community projects to large utility-scale 
developments. 

For our own operations, we have met 100% of our global electricity consumption with renewable energy since 
201711, and we aim to continue to transition to long-term contracts for new renewable energy sources to 
meet our future needs. We expect this approach to provide a more permanent and sustainable path to clean 
energy and serves as a catalyst for large-scale development that will provide new clean energy sources for 
Wells Fargo and beyond.

12 Environmental and energy use data included in this report are subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but 
acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. In this report, we are not using such terms “material” or “materiality” as they are used under the securities or other laws of the U.S. or any other 
jurisdiction, or as they are used in the context of financial statements and financial reporting. Materiality, for the purposes of this document, should not, therefore, be read as equating to any use of the word in other Wells Fargo reporting or 
filings. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. Consumption is based on raw data. When raw data is unavailable, the Company estimates consumption based on a square foot extrapolation of the average 
consumption from the most comparable facilities. Third-party data (such as electricity and fuel usage) has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the suitability of the design and effectiveness of the third-party systems and 
associated controls over the accuracy and completeness of the data has not been independently assessed.

Deploying clean energy across our operations 

Wells Fargo promotes clean energy usage across our facilities. Reductions from base year to our Scope 2 GHG, 
emissions which result primarily from purchased electricity, are supported in part by adding on-site solar. Wells 
Fargo made progress in 2022 in installing solar energy arrays at our facilities. Cumulatively through the end of 
2022, solar energy facilities had been commissioned at nearly 60 locations in eight U.S. states and two non-U.S. 
countries. 

A highlight of our 2022 progress was “flipping the switch” on a 2 megawatt solar installation at our Jordan 
Creek campus in Iowa. Wells Fargo is continuing to develop and install an additional approximately 10 
megawatts of new, on-site solar generation assets at nearly 30 corporate and retail locations in California, 
Arizona, and Minnesota through a vendor relationship with Ameresco. In addition, through the end of 2022, we 
have entered into over 210 megawatts of long-term agreements supporting new sources of renewable energy 
across 13 U.S. states and two non-U.S. countries, helping to create new jobs and advance the resiliency of 
communities in the process. 

Wells Fargo signed multiple clean-energy contracts that not only help to meet our own energy needs, but also 
support projects to deliver new clean options for businesses and households at a regional level. Highlights 
include: 

• Wells Fargo's off-site solar contract with Salt River Project came online in 2022, supporting our operations

in Arizona.

• An 8 megawatt subscription agreement signed in 2022 with US Solar in Colorado to build five new

community solar gardens, which are projected to generate enough energy to power almost 100 Wells
Fargo properties. Our relationship with US Solar provides early access for Wells Fargo employees to sign
up for US Solar's community solar program through Colorado employees' local utility.

Financing clean energy 

In 2022, Wells Fargo built on its status as a significant capital provider for clean energy in the U.S. Our 
Renewable Energy & Environmental Finance team had its largest year ever, deploying $2.7 billion of tax equity 
capital for renewable power and storage projects, bringing its total lifetime investment to $15.9 billion. In 
addition, our renewable energy and asset finance business continued to grow its portfolio of project loans to 
support a range of renewable energy technologies. Financed projects include large-scale solar installations, as 
well as distributed projects like commercial and community solar. Some of these community solar projects are 
developed to specifically serve low- to moderate-income households. 

In addition to expanding existing businesses, in 2022 we entered new clean energy markets. For example, Wells 
Fargo entered the residential solar loan market for the first time, closing a $200 million solar warehousing line 
with a leading residential solar loan originator. This financing will allow households to save money through 
rooftop solar with little or no money down. 

Also in 2022, Wells Fargo supported the continued development of battery storage technology and 
deployment, which is critical to advancing clean energy adoption. This included providing loans to several 
renewable energy projects that incorporated storage. We also invested in storage projects with our tax equity 
capital to further support this growing market.

Increase sustainability where we 
live and work 

Across our footprint, we are working to minimize use of energy, water, and other resources, and reduce GHG 
emissions in our operations. 

Advancing progress across our operations 

Wells Fargo has set refreshed operational sustainability goals for 2030: 

• Reducing GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) from 2019 levels by 70%.

• Reducing energy usage from 2019 levels by 50%.

• Reducing total waste stream from 2019 levels by 50%.

• Reducing water usage from 2019 levels by 45%.
• Driving new renewable energy projects to meet 100% of annual purchased electricity needs.17

Wells Fargo plans to achieve these goals by continuing to work to reduce our energy and water consumption, 
and total waste stream, while maintaining our commitment to the health and well-being of our employees and 
a positive workplace experience. 

Across our footprint, we made progress in 2022 toward our ongoing efforts to transition to more renewable 
energy sources. We also announced plans to consolidate our office space in the Dallas area with a new 22-acre 
campus that is expected to produce more energy at that site than it consumes. More than 3,000 employees 
will report to the new Dallas campus, expected to open in 2025. 

17 Wells Fargo has been meeting 100% of its electricity consumption with renewable energy primarily with unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates from existing assets, with a goal to transition to long-term agreements that directly 
support new sources of renewable energy.

For our new Dallas campus and other construction projects, Wells Fargo continues to use the U.S. Green 
Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, certification framework as a 
benchmarking tool and to help guide best practices. The new state-of-the-art campus at the Las Colinas Urban 
Center will include rooftop solar panels, electric vehicle charging stations, east-west orientation, exterior 
shades, electrochromic glass, grey water/storm water reclamation, sustainable building materials, and native 
plantings that minimize the need for irrigation and fertilizer. We are focused on consolidating our real estate 
assets in a way that reduces our environmental impact. 

Wells Fargo is also continuously exploring programs that allow us to reduce waste and increase diversion from 
landfills by expanding efforts like composting, recycling, and other ways to achieve a positive impact. One 
example is our long-running program to donate used office furniture to nonprofit groups across the country. 
From 2014 through 2022, we diverted nearly 12,000 tons of used furniture from landfills by making nearly    
$3 million worth of in-kind donations to more than 600 community organizations. This extended the useful 
lives of desks, chairs, and other furniture that may otherwise have been discarded. 

Removing carbon 

Wells Fargo works closely with a third-party expert to purchase carbon removal credits18 for Scope 1 and 2 of our operational 
GHG emissions. These credit purchases are evaluated against a set of specific quality criteria such as additionality, baseline, and 
carbon accounting methodology for credit issuance, alongside our potential negative impact on surrounding ecosystems and the 
length of time carbon is stored. 

In addition to the purchase of high-quality carbon credits, Wells Fargo recognizes the importance of supporting the 
advancement of carbon removal through our philanthropic efforts. We have made grants to help to fund regenerative 
agriculture, soil health research, forest carbon program advancement, ocean carbon research, and many other meaningful and 
measurable activities. For example, a $200,000 grant from Wells Fargo to the Soil Health Academy is helping to advance the 
adoption of soil health-focused regenerative agriculture throughout the U.S. 

18 For 2022, a portion of these credits are Verified Carbon Standard certified and have also achieved the add-on Climate, Community and Biodiversity certification and are therefore Verified Carbon Standard+Climate, Community and 
Biodiversity certified. The remaining portion is certified by the Climate Action Reserve.

Financing a greener future 

Many lines of Wells Fargo's business finance activities promote sustainability in our day-to-day lives either at 
home or at work. Included in the Company’s efforts is our significant consumer EV auto lending business, which 
now represents nearly 10% of the auto loan portfolio by volume and helps customers across the country move 
toward clean transportation. We were also the sole lender on a combined $35 million deal to support Orange 
EV, a manufacturer and servicer of electric yard trucks used by freight transportation and warehousing 
companies to move trailers around their properties. Orange EV is a leader in the heavy-duty EV space with over 
700 trucks deployed with more than 170 fleets.19 

In 2022, Wells Fargo also led the financing for Washington, D.C. to replace approximately 75,000 of its city 
lights (i.e., streetlights, lighting along paths, etc.) with energy-efficient LED technology and install wireless 
access points for broadband. The lights are also being equipped with remote monitoring and control. Switching 
to LED lights is expected to reduce energy consumption by more than 50%, while eliminating 38,000 metric 
tons of GHG emissions annually.20 
We also advance sustainability by supporting green buildings21. Real Estate Capital Europe named Wells Fargo 
the runner-up for its Sustainability Financing Deal of the Year: Europe for a sustainability-linked refinancing 
deal in London. Also, Wells Fargo led a $3.5 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit facility for CBRE, a 
leading global commercial real estate firm. The terms of the facility are linked to CBRE’s pledge to increase 
LEED-certified square footage and to convert its fleet of vehicles to electric power. 

Supporting our employees to make an impact 

Wells Fargo appreciates the passion and generosity of our employees and the positive community impact they 
make through their time, talent, and monetary gifts to multiply the Company’s efforts. To support the 
volunteer efforts of our employees, we provide eligible employees with up to 16 hours of paid volunteer time 
each year to serve the communities where they live and work. Employees are empowered to dedicate their 
resources to the unique causes they care about most.

Volunteering in 2022: highlights 
Global, location-based Employee Impact Teams were created within Wells Fargo in spring 2022 by integrating 
two internal groups, Green Teams and Volunteer Chapters. Fifty-two Employee Impact Teams keep interested 
employees connected to local volunteer opportunities in their communities, resulting in over 700,000 hours 
volunteered in 2022. 

Our Community Care Grants program recognizes employee gifts of time, talent, and treasure. Through 
personal giving or service activities, employees may qualify for up to $2,000 in Community Care Grants per 
year for their preferred eligible charities. Employees directed over $14 million in Community Care Grants to 
charities in 2022. 

The Welcome Home Program, introduced in 2022, is a month-long employee volunteer initiative focused on 
the intersection of affordable housing and sustainability across Wells Fargo’s global footprint. In 2022, over 90 
different charity partners received direct volunteer support from employees. In a single month, the program 
saw more than 5,000 employees log more than 24,000 hours of volunteer time across 274 volunteer events. 
Due to the outstanding success of this initial program, we plan to continue and scale this initiative in 2023. 

The Global Fellows Program provides Wells Fargo employees an opportunity to donate their time and 
professional skills in support of nonprofits in the U.S. and beyond to solve business challenges for selected 
organizations. Since 2014, nearly 250 Global Fellows have provided consultation to more than 30 
organizations. In 2022, the program expanded to support 14 projects, including seven projects on behalf of 
nonprofit grantees of the Wells Fargo Foundation, with fellows completing a total of more than 2,400 
volunteer hours. For example, one team of five Global Fellows volunteered for a project on behalf of the 
Association for Enterprise Opportunity and Bankers Without Borders and was tasked with evaluating, 
analyzing, and reporting on the current operations at Association for Enterprise Opportunity to recommend 
improvements to the organization’s operations to foster growth and efficiency. 

“Global Fellows came at such a great time in my career. I feel re-energized about my 
profession and the ways my career experience translates to solve other industry 
challenges. This program has also been helpful in recommitting to why I have stayed 
with Wells Fargo for 18 years.”

Many Wells Fargo employees are active in nonprofit board service in the communities where they live and 
work. In 2022, we published a board resource guide and partnered with BoardSource, a leading industry 
organization on board governance, to further support employee board participation. Employees have access to 
a host of free resources on board service, interpreting financial information, fundraising, and finding a board 
that’s right for each individual. 

Volunteering to support housing access 

Wells Fargo donated to the Veterans Community Project to build tiny houses in St. Louis for veterans in need of transitional 
housing. In addition to a grant of $100,000, Wells Fargo employees volunteered their time to help build these homes for 
veterans in need. Our offices in St. Louis also hosted an event to assemble hygiene kits with basic necessities for veterans 
in the area.

Advance climate finance and innovation 

Many of the financing tools and technologies needed to transition to a low-carbon economy already exist and 
are commercially viable. However, innovation and advancement are still needed. In some cases new financing 
mechanisms must be paired with policies and updated market practices. And new companies and technologies 
must be nurtured to push innovation forward and provide the full set of solutions society needs to transition to 
a low-carbon economy. 

Moving climate finance forward 

Today, Wells Fargo offers a range of financing tools to support customers' voluntary adoption of low-carbon 
solutions. But barriers remain that can make it difficult for some customers to transition. One example of this 
is regarding multifamily and affordable housing. In 2022, we teamed with RMI (formerly Rocky Mountain 
Institute) to convene key industry experts and practitioners, including leading developers, lenders, policy 
influencers, and others, to engage in interactive workshops to address the challenges impeding the 
advancement of affordable low-carbon multifamily housing. Several strategies emerged from the workshops, 
including providing guidance on how to improve existing climate-related data reporting and benchmarking 
systems, and deploying grants to technical assistance programs. 

An integrated approach across the solar value chain 

Wells Fargo is a leading tax-equity investor in solar projects. With our broad range of capabilities and financing solutions spanning 
markets and customer segments across the globe, Wells Fargo goes beyond project deployment to support the entire solar 
value chain. Today, Wells Fargo serves clients that manufacture, distribute, and install solar panels and solar components around 
the world. We also provide a suite of financing and investment tools including construction finance, bridge lending, long-term 
asset-based loans, asset-backed securitization, and tax-equity investment. This work supports everything from large utility-scale 
projects to community-solar and individual rooftop projects. This ecosystem-based approach is enabled by close coordination 
among multiple Wells Fargo teams.

Contributing philanthropically 

The Wells Fargo Foundation dedicates resources to support philanthropy related to our sustainability priorities. 
These initiatives are intended to support an equity-focused transition to a low-carbon economy with an 
emphasis on mitigating climate impacts and expanding sustainable finance solutions. We partner with 
nongovernmental organizations such as RMI that help advance climate finance solutions, including those 
focused on low- and moderate-income communities. We also support the acceleration and adoption of clean 
technologies, working with partners nationally, like our collaboration with the National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory through the Wells Fargo Innovation Incubator, or IN2, program. 

Collaborating with the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator 

One example of our philanthropic approach to climate finance is the Wells Fargo Foundation’s support for the 
Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, or LACI. In 2022, LACI announced the launch of its nationwide LACI 
Cleantech Debt Fund, a first-of-its-kind green loan program to scale early-stage cleantech startups and 
accelerate equitable climate action. LACI aims to help underrepresented business founders overcome some of 
the institutional and historical barriers they face in accessing capital to grow their companies. The Debt Fund 
provides non-dilutive capital to early-stage startups. Unlike most traditional loans, LACI does not require 
personal collateral or personal credit scores for underwriting. To support this important work, Wells Fargo 
provided grant funding to cover LACI's initial operating costs and loan loss reserves. 

Advancing progress through the Wells Fargo Innovation Incubator 

Another philanthropic venture is the Wells Fargo Innovation Incubator program, a $50 million collaboration 
between the Wells Fargo Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory. IN² provides technical assistance and validation to promising cleantech startups with a goal to 
quickly and successfully drive innovative technologies to market that lower carbon emissions and better 
position them for investment. The IN² portfolio includes 65 companies that each receive up to $250,000 in 
nondilutive capital and research support. In 2022, IN² launched the program’s first all-demonstration cohort, 
meaning each of the five startups chosen will complete the program with an actual demonstration of their 
technologies. 

 
Wells Fargo | Sustainability and Governance Report

To boost impact, IN² fosters an ecosystem of expertise and support. The IN² Channel Partner network includes 
more than 60 incubators, accelerators, and universities that mentor and refer companies to the program. The 
Wells Fargo IN² board of directors reviews applicants, providing a business perspective as part of the decision-
making process. Two external advisory boards, the Commercial Buildings and Housing Board and the 
Sustainable Agriculture Board, select the final participants. 
The Farmers Business Network, an IN2 partner, provides field trial opportunities and exposure to commercial 
markets to agtech startups. In 2016, IN² launched the $5 million Channel Partner Award program to support 
events, strategic meetings and trainings, and large collaborative initiatives between the Channel Partners. The 
program expanded in 2020 and will deliver an additional $5 million in Channel Partner Awards through 2024.

Support an equity-focused transition 

As part of Wells Fargo’s commitment to sustainability, we maintain a focus on vulnerable communities, helping 
them mitigate climate impacts and gain access to sustainable finance solutions. 

Enabling sustainable-affordable housing through philanthropy 

Multifamily and single-family housing contribute significantly to overall emissions from the building sector, 
however; efforts to reduce emissions in affordable housing are nascent and complex. To help address this 
challenge, Wells Fargo has provided grants to support and accelerate efforts that couple climate-related 
principles with affordable housing. This combination helps improve community and individual household 
resilience in the face of volatility brought on by climate change, extreme weather events, and increases in utility 
costs. 

For example, a $1.5 million grant from Wells Fargo to the Inclusiv Smart-E Loan program will help community 
development credit unions accelerate affordable sustainable financing for low- and moderate-income 
communities in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. The Smart-E Loan program vets contractors and potential 
sustainable projects, and provides technical assistance to community development credit unions to help 
expand lending to their customers. An important goal of the program is for low-income households to access 
energy efficiency and decarbonization projects that help improve their homes and lower utility costs. 

In another example, the Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future leveraged a grant from Wells Fargo to 
create a tool that allows affordable housing portfolio owners to calculate their annual GHG emissions. With this 
calculator, Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future hopes to equip partners and other affordable 
multifamily portfolio owners with the necessary tools to establish credible baselines of their GHG emissions 
footprint and make informed decisions on how to reduce their overall emissions.

Advancing climate resiliency in communities across the U.S. 

Wells Fargo recognizes that the impact of climate change can affect some communities more than others. As 
part of Wells Fargo’s focus on climate resiliency, we collaborated with the Institute for Sustainable 
Communities and the Tides Foundation to launch the Dismantling Energy Inequity in Communities of Color 
program in 2022 (announced in early 2023). The initiative was enabled by a $2.85 million grant from the Wells 
Fargo Foundation to create more equitable access to clean and affordable energy and improve climate 
resiliency in historically excluded communities. 

From this initiative, the Institute for Sustainable Communities created a national cohort across 10 U.S. cities, 
leveraging the expertise of Black-, Brown-, and Indigenous-led community-based organizations to develop 
weather-resilient, solar-powered community centers, known as resilience hubs. These hubs will serve as 
gathering places for community members in times of joy — with support through educational and social 
programs — and in times of climate-related and severe-weather crisis — including flooding and power outages 
— as cooling centers in the summer and heat shelters in the winter. 

Wells Fargo also provided a grant to The Greenlining Institute to support the California Strategic Growth 
Council's Transformative Climate Communities program implementation in the city of Stockton, California. 
The grant will support the community-driven application of Stockton’s Sustainable Neighborhood Plan, which 
includes water efficiency upgrades, urban tree canopy development to mitigate heat island effects, and energy 
efficiency upgrades for low-income households.

Wells Fargo Institute for Sustainable Finance 

In 2021, we launched the Wells Fargo Institute for Sustainable Finance, which supports clients and communities in accelerating 
the transition to an equitable, low‑carbon economy. 

The Institute publishes research, surveys, and articles, and convenes subject matter experts for roundtables and workshops. The 
goal is to identify proven and emerging approaches to increase sustainable financing and community investment opportunities, 
including the deployment of $500 billion in sustainable financing by 2030. 

The Institute also serves as a resource for employees, hosting employee learning sessions and webinars and publishing content 
relevant to their professional and personal lives, such as a briefing on how the federal Inflation Reduction Act can create potential 
business opportunities for our bank. 

Working with mayors to advance resilient cities 

Through a year-long collaboration with the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Wells Fargo embarked on an initiative to educate mayors 
and business leaders on best practices to address and reduce the impacts of climate change in their communities. Following a 
series of engagements with mayors and a workshop with city representatives and public and private sector organizations, the 
U.S. Conference of Mayors published a white paper, “Investing in Resilient and Equitable Neighborhoods,” exploring how 
multisector efforts can reduce emissions and prepare communities for future risks.

Wells Fargo's second Inclusive Communities and Climate Bond, a $2 billion bond, supported sustainable finance efforts for 
projects and programs that contribute to housing affordability, economic opportunity, renewable energy, and clean 
transportation. The Company was recognized at the 8th Climate Bonds Awards for the Largest Financial Corporate Sustainability 
Bond of 2022 by the Climate Bonds Initiative. 

More information about the Inclusive Communities and Climate Bond is available in our annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website. 

Deploying sustainable finance 

In 2022, Wells Fargo continued to leverage its broad range of products, solutions, and capabilities across our 
lines of business to drive financing toward sustainable activities. This included using existing financing tools 
that have long been a strength of Wells Fargo, including commercial and consumer lending, equipment finance, 
and debt underwriting. We also drove capital through business units built from the ground up to serve 
sustainability objectives. These include Community Lending & Investment, Renewable Energy & Environmental 
Finance, and Sustainable Finance & Advisory. 

25 Priority focus areas are bolded. Focus area categorization is based on the primary assigned focus area of each grant at the time of application. Grants with multiple focus areas are shown only under their primary area of focus. 
26 For the purposes of this table, Sustainability totals are inclusive of grants supporting climate resiliency in vulnerable communities, enabling finance focused on climate including vulnerable communities, support of cleantech, as well as 
those grants that are made and categorized by team members across the Wells Fargo Foundation.

As Wells Fargo grows its sustainable finance activities, we strive to produce transparent and accurate 
reporting. To that end, we provide a breakdown of sustainable finance volume (see below), and measure 
progress toward our $500 billion goal based on our Sustainable Finance Eligibility Criteria ("the criteria"), which 
is included in the Appendix of this report. 

Our criteria evolve as industry best practices change and mature and are built around two key premises: 

•  Wells Fargo defines sustainability to include both environmental and social transactions. 

•  The criteria are designed to capture transactions where the funds are used for sustainable activities, 

including transactions with features that encourage qualifying sustainable activities. 

These premises align with the Company’s continued focus on delivering benefits to our clients, customers, and 
communities. 

During the calendar years 2021 and 2022, Wells Fargo originated, committed, advised, or facilitated 
approximately $129 billion in sustainable finance activities, representing approximately 26% of our 
commitment to deploy $500 billion of sustainable finance between 2021 and 2030. Wells Fargo’s sustainable 
finance activity is divided into three categories: standard-aligned sustainable finance, environmental finance, 
and social finance. Approximately 57% of our progress through 2022 supported standard-aligned sustainable 
finance, while close to 28% went to environmental finance, and around 15% supported social finance. For each 
of our first two years of progress toward our $500 billion goal, we obtained limited assurance27 on our 
assertion of the total amount of sustainable finance activities originated, committed, advised, or facilitated 
that meet the criteria28. 

27 See Independent Accountants’ Review Report in the Appendix of this report for more details. 
28 Our 2022 Sustainable Finance Criteria was updated for calendar year 2022 related to Green Buildings (inclusion of additional green building certification schemes), Housing Affordability (inclusion of financing that meets government and 
government-sponsored enterprise definitions of affordable housing), and Standard-aligned Sustainable Finance (inclusion of transactions not captured by Dealogic or Bloomberg and reviewed internally). See Sustainable Finance Eligibility 
Criteria in the  Appendix for more details.

In 2022, the U.S. passed the Inflation Reduction Act, one of the largest climate and clean energy policies in the world. The 
Inflation Reduction Act provides an estimated $369 billion in federal incentives to support clean energy deployment, vehicle 
electrification, cleantech manufacturing, industrial decarbonization, and commercialization of key new energy solutions like green 
hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration. These incentives are expected to mobilize more than $1 trillion of 
private investment this decade. Clients across sectors have already reached out regarding potential financing solutions and 
information related to obtaining Inflation Reduction Act benefits on new projects. We are providing briefings to clients and 
teams internally to raise awareness. The Company is also directly engaging with policymakers to inform program design and 
encouraging effective implementation. We will continue to monitor Inflation Reduction Act developments, keep clients informed, 
and look for opportunities to serve clients and participate in these growing markets.

Improving our operational and business sustainability 

As noted earlier in this report, Wells Fargo is working to employ tactics to drive efficiencies and responsible 
resource use. Through our ongoing efforts, we aim to reduce the GHG emissions, water and energy 
consumption, and waste associated with our operations. Notably, in 2022, we saw increases in our resource 
usage and emissions output as more people returned to the office after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Wells Fargo continues efforts to consolidate our real estate portfolio and employ additional steps to minimize 
waste and conserve energy as we work to meet our refreshed operational sustainability goals.

Greenhouse gas emissions 
Wells Fargo calculates our operational Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by 
an organization. Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, 
steam, heat, or cooling, and are a result of the organization's energy use.

36Totals in this figure and others in this report may not add correctly due to rounding.
37Environmental and energy use data included in this report are subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but 
acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. Consumption is based on raw data. When raw data is unavailable, the Company 
estimates consumption based on a square foot extrapolation of the average consumption from the most comparable facilities. Third-party data (such as electricity and fuel usage) has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but 
the suitability of the design and effectiveness of the third-party systems and associated controls over the accuracy and completeness of the data has not been independently assessed.
38 MTCO2e stands for metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. 
39 A location-based method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs (using grid average emission factor data). A market-based method reflects emissions from electricity that Wells Fargo has 
purposefully chosen. It derives emission factors from contractual instruments, which include any type of contract between two parties for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation, or for 
unbundled attribute claims. 
40 In 2022, Wells Fargo purchased carbon offsets from projects that remove and store carbon. A portion of these credits are Verified Carbon Standard (VSC) certified and have also achieved the add-on Climate, Community and Biodiversity 
(CCB) certification and are therefore VSC+CCB certified. The remaining portion is certified by the Climate Action Reserve (CAR).
41 As part of its journey toward net zero, Wells Fargo has implemented carbon reduction strategies and purchased energy attribute certificates and carbon offsets sufficient to cover its total Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions 
for 2022.

Increasing engagement with suppliers 

Wells Fargo’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website, outlines our 
expectation that suppliers not only comply with applicable laws, regulations, and contract terms, but also 
conduct themselves with the highest standards of ethical business practices. We encourage our suppliers to 
join us in implementing systems designed to minimize negative impacts on the environment. Wells Fargo 
works with suppliers to understand their environmental and social considerations. As an example, the below 
table shows our engagement of certain suppliers to report their environmental data through CDP’s 
questionnaires to better understand their emissions profile and approach to climate resiliency.

Live our expectations 

Wells Fargo is committed to a culture that attracts and retains the best people who help us become a better, 
stronger company. Our culture is reinforced by a set of core expectations that play a vital role in our 
transformation journey. These Company Expectations apply to all employees at Wells Fargo – they reinforce 
the highest standards of integrity and operational excellence and guide how we collaborate and execute as a 
team; embrace our differences; simplify and improve the work that we deliver; and develop, recognize, and 
inspire our employees to achieve performance excellence. 

Wells Fargo Expectations 

Employee feedback has contributed significantly to enhancing our culture and improving the employee 
experience in recent years. Employees can share their voices and valuable insights in several ways throughout 
the year – including town hall meetings with leaders, surveys, and an employee feedback platform called 
Loudspeaker, which was introduced in 2021. To date, employees have submitted thousands of ideas and 
recommendations, many of which have been implemented, leading to efficiencies and innovation, and 
furthering employee engagement. 

Diversity, equity, and inclusion 

Wells Fargo is committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion with a belief that a company's workforce 
should reflect the customers they serve and the U.S. population more broadly. In addition to focusing on 
diversity across our workforce, we support strategic opportunities that include diverse suppliers in competitive 
sourcing and procurement opportunities within our supply chain, along with efforts to support diverse 
customers. More information about our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, including data on our 
representation, hires, promotions, turnovers, and support for diverse customers, is available in our annual 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website.

Support for employees 

Wells Fargo believes it takes the best talent available to deliver the best the industry has to offer. And that 
means focusing on every aspect of being an employer of choice. 

Wells Fargo delivers a broad range of benefits designed to support employees when and where they need help 
most. We provide compelling opportunities for employees to connect and work together to strengthen 
themselves and their communities. And we actively work to instill a culture where individuals matter, teamwork 
is rewarded, flexibility is valued, and people are respected. 

Compensating employees competitively 

Competitive and fair compensation is a priority for Wells Fargo and our employees. We provide clear and 
simple guidelines on how compensation is determined: 

Wells Fargo pays for performance. Compensation is linked to Company, business group, and individual 
performance, including meeting regulatory expectations and creating long-term value consistent with the 
interests of shareholders. 

Wells Fargo promotes effective risk management. Compensation promotes effective risk management and 
discourages imprudent or excessive risk-taking. 

Wells Fargo is focused on attracting and retaining talent. Compensation helps to attract, motivate, and 
retain people with the skills, talent, and experience to drive superior long-term Company performance. 

Pay equity 

Wells Fargo is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices and, since 2015, has conducted an 
annual pay equity review through engagement with a third-party expert. The review analyzes employee 
compensation, taking into account gender, race, and ethnicity, and factors such as role, tenure, and geography. 
The review process can include compensation adjustments in the event we identify pay gaps. The 2022 review, 
modified for adjustments as described, showed that globally, women at Wells Fargo earn more than 99 cents 
for every $1 earned by their male peers, and U.S. employees who are racially/ethnically diverse earn more than 
99 cents for every $1 earned by their white peers.

Employee benefits 

Wells Fargo provides eligible full-time and part-time employees with a comprehensive set of benefits designed 
to support their physical, mental, and financial health. We also provide employees with a variety of competitive 
employer-paid financial protection benefits, including life insurance, short- and long-term disability coverage, 
and business travel accident insurance. In some countries, we provide additional plans that extend health 
insurance coverage and long-term disability coverage, as well as flexible benefits options, such as personal 
accident coverage. Employees in the U.S. have an opportunity to participate in the 401(k) Plan and receive up 
to a 6% match to help save for the future. Employees earning less than $75,000 a year receive an automatic 
401(k) Plan contribution of 1% of pay. U.S. employees may also participate in a stock purchase plan and take 
advantage of discounts on financial products, home mortgages, and more. 

Well Life. In 2022, Wells Fargo launched Well Life, a new employer brand strategy to attract and retain high-
performing talent. Well Life promotes holistic living that improves overall quality of life. It fosters a sense of 
community among coworkers by providing support and motivation to work toward common well-being goals. 

“The Well Life is for and about Wells Fargo employees! It's the expression of the 
passion, dedication, and spirit that our employees bring to work every day and all the 
good things that come from being a part of this great Company. It's our hope that 
employees see themselves reflected in the Well Life.” 
— Deborah Hyman, Wells Fargo Enterprise Communications & 

Employer Brand 

Physical health. Wells Fargo offers comprehensive and competitive medical benefits, as well as dental and 
vision benefits in many countries. U.S. medical plans offer preventive care services covered at 100%, 
prescription drug benefits, and a network of doctors and hospitals to help employees and their families 
maintain their health. Employees enrolled in certain U.S. medical plans can earn up to $800 in health and 
wellness dollars annually for completing wellness-related activities. Eligible spouses and domestic partners can 
earn an additional $400 in health and wellness dollars. In addition, Wells Fargo contributes up to $1,000 into a 
health savings account for U.S. employees earning less than $45,000 who are enrolled in certain medical plans. 
Employees earning $45,000 to $100,000 who are enrolled in certain medical plans receive up to $500 in a 
health savings account.

Mental health. Wells Fargo is committed to creating a safe, inclusive environment where differences are 
respected and embraced. In 2022, we launched a comprehensive campaign designed to reduce the stigma 
around mental health, support employee well-being, and promote mental health resources available to 
employees and their families. The campaign began with a focus on managers, offering tips, educational 
information, and a conversation guide to help managers normalize the topic. While resources available to 
employees vary across the globe, in the U.S. and in some other countries these include a mental health mobile 
app, one-on-one wellness coaching, and in-person and virtual counseling through Wells Fargo’s medical plan 
benefits. Employees in all countries have access to counseling support available through the Employee 
Assistance Program. 

Family. Wells Fargo provides extensive benefits for employees who are starting families. U.S. benefits include 
maternity support, up to $35,000 in support for fertility treatments, up to $5,000 in reimbursement for costs 
related to adoption, and free breast milk shipping for employees who are traveling on Company business. 
Additionally, we understand the importance of flexibility in addressing family needs. In the U.S. we provide up 
to 16 weeks of paid time off following the birth or adoption of a child. Market-competitive paid time off 
following the birth or adoption of a child is also offered internationally. Backup childcare programs are available 
in the U.S. and in some other countries. In addition, the U.S. and some other countries provide up to five days of 
paid critical caregiving leave to care for a seriously ill family member or for emergency back-up care.

Manager Advisory 

Manager Advisory was launched in September 2022 as part of an effort to provide an enhanced level of 
support and skill development to managers at Wells Fargo. Manager Advisory works with managers within the 
U.S. who don’t have a directly aligned contact for their general HR needs. This team provides access to 
experienced HR professionals who help to educate, equip, and empower managers to more effectively lead 
their teams. Support includes interpretation and application of HR related policies, and strategies for coaching 
and managing employee performance, talent management, and optimizing team dynamics.

Caring for employees in times of transition 
As Wells Fargo continues transforming our businesses, we recognize that employees may be impacted, and we 
provide transparent communication about the programs and opportunities they can access for support. 

In some cases, organizational restructuring results in employee displacements or job eliminations because of 
economic or operational factors. In the event of displacements in the U.S., we support employees and provide 
tools to assist them with career transitions, including: 

•  Wells Fargo’s Displacement Policy requires that all displaced employees in the U.S. are provided a 60-day 

notice period, unless otherwise required by federal, state, or local laws. Regardless of working or 
nonworking status, employees are still considered employed during the entire notice period. 

•  Employees are eligible for a minimum of eight weeks of severance and up to 52 weeks, based on their 
completed years of service, during which they will also have continued access to health coverage. 

•  We also offer displaced employees access to career transition services through a third-party service 

provider that offers career coaching, professional resume writing, connections to hiring managers and 
recruiters, and interviewing practices. 

In countries where we operate outside of the U.S., the practices of managing redundancies and workforce 
restructuring vary based on legal and regulatory requirements and local market practices. International support 
may include enhanced severance pay arrangements, employee assistance programs, and career transition 
services. 

Prioritizing employee safety and health 

Wells Fargo recognizes the importance of providing a safe and healthy environment for employees, customers, 
and others on our premises. This is supported by our Risk & Insurance Management Policy and our Safety & 
Health Program, which provide details on our training and objectives covering all our employees. We have 
designed and implemented programs to help reduce the frequency and severity of injuries and illnesses, and 
also make special accommodations available to help injured employees return to work when they are able. 

We are required to comply with applicable facility-related, legally-mandated standards for workplace safety 
and health in the countries and communities in which we operate. Employees are responsible for following safe 
work practices and reporting unsafe working conditions.

Newly hired employees are expected to complete safety and health training, and certain employee groups have 
quarterly refresher training requirements. Additionally, managers are expected to provide training on job-
specific hazards at the time of an employee’s initial assignment and provide retraining whenever: 

•  New substances, processes, procedures, or equipment are introduced into the workplace that represent a 

potential new hazard. 

•  The manager is made aware of a new or previously unrecognized safety or health hazard. 

•  An employee is given a new job assignment and has not received training for that assignment. 

Given the nature of Wells Fargo's business, injuries that occur as a result of repetitive activity, slips, trips, and 
falls are the most common workplace injuries. 

We provide and encourage utilization of our ergonomics program, with training and awareness resources on 
these and other topics accessible for all employees internally through our intranet site. 

Anti-harassment and anti-discrimination 

Wells Fargo is dedicated to providing a workplace free from harassment and discrimination based on an 
individual’s race, ethnicity, age, gender, or other protected characteristics. This includes, but is not limited to, on 
company property or company communication systems, during remote work or business travel, at company- 
sponsored events, or otherwise in connection with company business. 

Any such harassment or discrimination is against Wells Fargo policy, may violate the law, and will not be 
tolerated. In the event of harassment or discrimination, employees are required to promptly report it using a 
reporting channel described in the Resources to report potential misconduct section. Training on harassment 
and discrimination is provided annually to employees.

Commitment to sound and effective corporate governance practices46 

Wells Fargo and its Board of Directors is committed to sound and effective corporate governance practices. 

Our Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which provide the framework for the governance of 
our Board and Company, including maintaining the independence of a significant majority of the directors on 
the Board, and all members of the Audit, Governance and Nominating, Human Resources, and Risk 
Committees. Additionally, the Board adopted Director Independence Standards, which are appended to the 
Corporate Governance Guidelines. These Director Independence Standards consist of the New York Stock 
Exchange’s “bright line” standards of independence, as well as additional standards. 

At the Board level, the Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for overseeing corporate 
governance practices, and the Corporate Responsibility Committee provides primary oversight for significant 
strategies, policies, and programs related to social and public responsibility. The Chief Sustainability Officer 
provides periodic updates on climate and sustainability initiatives to the Corporate Responsibility Committee 
of the Board of Directors. 

At the Company level, management councils and committees provide senior leadership guidance on 
sustainability initiatives, with formal governance provided by our risk and control management committees. 

46 Further information related to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Governance and Nominating Committee, and the Corporate Responsibility Committee can be found on our Leadership and Governance website.

Ownership of sustainability initiatives 

At Wells Fargo, the responsibility for driving sustainability action and impact is shared by a number of individuals, teams, 
governance bodies, and other forums. While we actively integrate sustainability across the Company, Enterprise Sustainability 
helps to steer the Company’s broader sustainability strategy, including monitoring and driving progress toward our climate and 
sustainability goals, making sustainability-focused grants, and leading the Institute for Sustainable Finance. This team provides 
expertise and actively engages with others across the Company to execute on sustainability initiatives, including managing the 
Climate Implementation Initiative (established in 2021). For example, the Sustainability team coordinates with dedicated teams 
within Corporate Properties and Supply Chain, respectively, that lead efforts to drive energy, water, and waste efficiencies, and 
engage suppliers on sustainability-related matters. 

Sustainability is also embedded in parts of our customer-facing businesses, working to directly support clients’ transition to a 
low-carbon future with expertise on sustainable finance and participating in the cross-enterprise Climate Implementation 
Initiative. For more information about the transition to a low-carbon future, please see our Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website.

Executive compensation 

The Human Resources Committee47 of the Board oversees Wells Fargo’s performance management and 
incentive compensation programs and approves all compensation for Operating Committee members . As part 
of this oversight, the Human Resources Committee establishes the Company's performance goals to 
incentivize Operating Committee members to deliver on our strategic priorities. 

More information about the Company and individual Named Executive Officer performance for 2022 and 
Human Resources Committee engagement with shareholders is available in the 2023 Wells Fargo Proxy 
Statement, which can be found on our Annual Reports and Proxy Statements website. 

Board diversity 

The Governance and Nominating Committee and our Board of Directors believe it is essential that the 
composition of our Board reflects the diversity of the communities we serve. As described in the Corporate 
Governance Guidelines and the Governance and Nominating Committee’s charter, the Governance and 
Nominating Committee will consider, in identifying or evaluating first-time candidates or nominees for 
director, the current composition of our Board and the candidate’s or nominee’s experience, education, skills, 
background, gender, race, ethnicity, and other qualities and attributes in relation to the other Board members. 

Over the past few years, the Board has undergone significant refreshment to enhance the financial services, 
regulatory, financial reporting, business operations, and corporate governance skills and experiences 
represented on the Board. The Board’s current composition is a result of a thoughtful process informed by the 
Board’s own evaluation of its composition and effectiveness, and feedback received from shareholders and 
other stakeholders.

Code of Conduct 

The Wells Fargo Code of Conduct (Code), which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website, applies to all 
employees, including executive officers. Employees are expected to adhere to the Code, Employee Handbook, 
and Company policies and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The Code covers topics including, but 
not limited to, anti-bribery and corruption, anticompetitive behavior, insider activities, gifts, conflicts of 
interest, global compliance, discrimination, information confidentiality and security, and reporting potential 
misconduct. 

Fair and transparent products, services, and business practices 

Doing what is right for customers must be at the center of all our actions. We have taken important steps to 
embed this mindset into all of our decisions, which feeds into all the ways in which we touch customers. This 
extends from product design and pricing to our coverage and service models and how we approach complaints 
and remediations. We recognize that our actions speak much louder than our words. 

Wells Fargo established the Office of Consumer Practices in 2021 as a Companywide, consumer-focused 
advisory group within the Chief Operating Office. It is designed to help ensure our products, services, and 
business practices are fair and transparent and reinforce a customer-centric culture. 

The Office of Consumer Practice's work complements efforts already underway to improve our business 
practices. Its activities include: 

•  Assessing and advising on consumer-related products, services, and business practices so the consumer’s 

perspective is embedded in decision-making. 

•  Engaging throughout elements of the customer-product life cycle, including advising on product 

development considerations, like terms, conditions, and pricing. 

•  Reviewing complaint metrics and other data to help identify and advise on potential consumer-related 

trends and outcomes. 

•  Providing advice on policies, procedures, and training that impact how Wells Fargo interacts with 

consumers, including older adults and people with disabilities.

Client satisfaction and protection 

Wells Fargo’s Enterprise Complaints and Remediations organization brings together key functions from across 
the Company to effectively care for customers who have expressed a concern or been adversely affected by 
the Company. 

Our complaints team listens to our customers and works to capture, understand, and address their concerns. 
Additionally, the insights shared by the complaints team are used to support the continuous improvement of 
Front Line operations. Our remediations team works to make customers whole, when appropriate, by providing 
remediation in a high-quality, consistent, and timely manner. Across our organization, our teams are 
committed to doing what’s right for our customers and supporting the continued transformation of our 
Company. 

Cybersecurity and privacy protection 

Cybersecurity organization 
Wells Fargo’s Cybersecurity division is dedicated to protecting our systems, networks, and data, including 
customer and employee data, through the design, execution, and oversight of our Information Security 
Program. The Cybersecurity organization is led by our Chief Information Security Officer, who reports to the 
head of Technology. The Board's Risk Committee annually approves the Information Security Program. 

Wells Fargo's Information Security Program includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to 
protect Wells Fargo’s information, information systems, other assets, and customer information as required by 
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act’s Safeguards Rule (GLBA 501(b)). These safeguards meet the objectives of the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework’s five key functions: Identify, 
Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. These functions are performed at Wells Fargo concurrently and 
consistently to form an adaptive and dynamic operating environment that is equipped to effectively address 
the evolving threat landscape. 

Employees and contractors with access to our Company’s systems are required to complete annual privacy and 
information security training designed to provide guidance for identifying and avoiding potential privacy and 
information security risk situations.

Responsible use of artificial intelligence 
Wells Fargo is focused on the responsible use of artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning. The 
responsible use of AI covers areas such as explainability (being able to explain how an AI solution works), 
identification and management of unintended biases, model risk management, performance monitoring, and 
governance around data and model usage. Our AI solutions are developed and governed in a cross-functional 
manner involving business stakeholders, Corporate Risk (including Compliance) and the Legal Department, and 
AI experts. We also work with AI machine learning leaders in academia and the technology industry to innovate 
responsibly and improve our customers’ experience through AI. 

Safeguarding data privacy 
As a global provider of financial services and products to consumers, corporate clients, small businesses, 
governments, and other institutions, Wells Fargo is committed to the protection and ethical use of the 
personal data we collect and process. 

We recognize the risks to protecting personal data in a fast-paced global economy with evolving technology, a 
robust regulatory environment, and a socially aware and sophisticated global community. While we have strong 
administrative, physical, and technical safeguards in place to protect personal data, we also understand the 
need to remain vigilant by continuously monitoring and assessing the landscape so we can deliver upon our 
commitments. 

Embracing a privacy culture 
Our Privacy Policy applies globally to all Wells Fargo business groups and enterprise functions that access, 
collect, process, or store individuals’ personal information. Individuals include people with whom we interact, 
such as current, former, or prospective customers (for example consumers, business customers and their 
employees, representatives, beneficial owners, guarantors, officers, and directors); vendors (including sole 
traders and/or employees of vendors); current or former employees and their dependents; job applicants; and 
contingent resources. 
Our Privacy Compliance function, which is part of Independent Risk Management52, is responsible for 
promoting a strong privacy risk culture through publication and maintenance of a privacy policy. The policy is 
applicable across the enterprise and includes a Privacy Steering Committee. The committee, comprising 
members representing all parts of our Company, oversees the implementation of the execution of the privacy 
program, and governs the management of privacy risks.

Implementing privacy controls 
Controls designed and implemented to promote and protect privacy are embedded throughout the 
organization. Controls are distributed across every business group, Corporate Risk, Chief Operating Office, and 
the remaining enterprise functions. 

Wells Fargo mandates Companywide privacy training, in addition to requiring comprehensive business line 
procedures to minimize data privacy risk. Our businesses strive to effectively manage risks associated with the 
collection, use, processing, sharing, disclosure, transmission, storage, retention, and disposal of personal 
information pertaining to customers, employees, and all other individuals. 

Providing a web-based privacy center 
We honor our customers’ privacy preferences regarding the processing of their personal data, how we share or 
restrict the use of their data, and how we use it and contact them for marketing purposes. 

The Wells Fargo Privacy Center web portal is a resource for individuals to request to see certain personal data 
about themselves or ask to delete certain data that our businesses, located in the U.S., have collected from 
them, subject to certain limitations. More information about the types of data we collect, how it is used, and 
choices available to individuals, can be found on our Privacy, Cookies, Security, and Legal website. 

Policy advocacy 

Like many companies, Wells Fargo engages in public policy advocacy on issues that impact our business at the 
local, state, and federal levels, including through membership in financial services industry trade associations. 
We regularly review our participation model and believe that engagement through these trade organizations, 
even potentially as a voice of opposition from time to time, is an integral part of our public policy strategy and 
best serves our customers, Company, employees, and communities. Participation in these groups comes with 
the understanding that we may not always agree with every position taken. In instances where we identify 
significant misalignment with trade associations to which we belong, we aim to share our perspective in a 
constructive manner. Additionally, we are not members of any tax-exempt organization in the U.S. that is 
primarily organized to write, endorse, and promote model legislation. 

Wells Fargo's Government Relations and Public Policy team manages our legislative and political activities in a 
manner consistent with good corporate governance practices.

Risk management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly affect our financial performance and our ability to 
meet the expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators, and other stakeholders. Risk is the 
possibility of an event occurring that could adversely affect our ability to achieve strategic or business 
objectives. We routinely take risks, within our risk appetite and approved exceptions, to achieve our business 
goals and serve our customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest rate, credit, liquidity, and 
market risks, and nonfinancial risks, such as operational risk (which includes compliance and model risks), and 
strategic and reputation risks. Every employee, in the course of their daily activities, creates risk and is 
responsible for managing risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, including establishing and 
maintaining our control environment. Every employee must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and 
Company policies. 

Senior management sets the tone at the top by supporting a strong culture, defined by Wells Fargo’s 
expectations and Code of Conduct, that guides how employees conduct themselves and make decisions. The 
Board oversees senior management in establishing and maintaining this culture and effectively managing risk. 
Senior management expects employees to speak up when they see something that could cause harm to our 
customers, communities, employees, shareholders, or reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s 
responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and 
to escalate their concerns when they have not been addressed. Wells Fargo’s performance management and 
incentive compensation programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk and reward under 
core principles that employees are expected to know and practice. Effective risk management is a central 
component of employee performance evaluations. 

The Company has three lines of defense for managing risk: the Front Line, Independent Risk Management, and 
Internal Audit. Each line of defense has distinct risk management responsibilities. 

•  Front Line: The Front Line, which comprises our principal lines of businesses and certain enterprise function 
activities, is the first line of defense. The Front Line is responsible for understanding the risks generated by 
its activities, applying adequate controls, and managing risk in the course of its business activities. 

• 

Independent Risk Management: Independent Risk Management is the second line of defense. It establishes 
and maintains the Company’s risk management program and provides oversight of, including challenge to 
and independent assessment and monitoring of, the Front Line’s execution of its risk management 
responsibilities.

• 

Internal Audit: Internal Audit is the third line of defense. It is responsible for acting as an independent 
assurance function and validates that the risk management program is adequately designed and 
functioning effectively. 

Wells Fargo’s Risk Management Framework sets forth our core principles for managing and governing risk. It is 
approved by the Board’s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually. Many other documents and 
policies flow from its core principles. 

Climate risk management 
Wells Fargo is committed to helping mitigate the impacts of climate change related to our activities and to 
partnering with key stakeholders, including communities and customers, to do the same. Wells Fargo considers 
climate change to be a driver of various risk types we manage, and we will continue to integrate climate 
considerations into our Risk Management Framework as our understanding of climate change and the risks 
driven by it evolve. 

More information about our climate-related risk management is available in the Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website. 

Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering program 
Wells Fargo’s risk-based global Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering, or BSA/AML, program is 
designed to comply with applicable BSA/AML laws commensurate with our risk profile. The BSA/AML program 
is approved by our Board of Directors through its Risk Committee. The BSA/AML program encompasses 
requirements specifically related to BSA/AML compliance risks and includes the following core elements: BSA 
officer, policies, risk assessments, gap analyses, testing, training, data analytics, customer due diligence, 
sanctions screening, transaction monitoring, reporting, other internal controls, and Internal Audit. 

Compliance with economic sanctions laws and regulations 
Wells Fargo has implemented a comprehensive risk‐based sanctions compliance program designed to facilitate 
compliance with applicable economic sanctions laws and regulations in every jurisdiction in which we operate.

Anti-Bribery and Corruption Compliance Program 
Wells Fargo has zero tolerance for bribery and corruption in any form and has implemented a global risk-based 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Compliance Program designed to confirm adherence to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act, and applicable anti-bribery and corruption laws in the jurisdictions where Wells Fargo does

Understanding environmental and social impacts 

Environmental and Social Impact Management Framework 
As part of our dedication to a strong risk culture, Wells Fargo recognizes that environmental and social issues 
have the potential to impact various risk types covered by our Risk Management Framework, including 
reputation risk, credit risk, and strategic risk. 
Our Environmental and Social Impact Management Framework55, or ESIM Framework, is designed to provide 
clarity and transparency to our stakeholders about how we approach the environmental and social impacts 
associated with certain financial relationships. It is intended to reflect key objectives from our ESIM Policy, 
which establishes expectations and requirements for identifying, assessing, and managing actual and potential 
environmental and social adverse impacts associated with certain commercial clients and financings. 

In accordance with the ESIM Policy, Wells Fargo requires additional environmental and social impact due 
diligence for certain clients in the following sectors: arms and armaments, consumer finance, projects in scope 
of the Equator Principles, coal and metal mining operations, and oil and gas operations. Additionally, the ESIM 
Policy also contains certain restrictions that are in line with our existing risk management processes. For 
example, business groups may not knowingly engage in certain commercial transactions involving companies 
deriving the majority of their revenues from coal mining extraction or mountaintop removal coal operations; 
projects associated with the expansion of an existing, or development of a new, coal mine, or development of a 
new coal-fired power plant; projects in the Alaska Arctic region in scope of the Equator Principles; modern 
slavery; forced or compulsory labor (including child labor); human trafficking; private prison companies; and 
immigrant detention centers. 

55 The ESIM Framework can be found on our Goals and Reporting website.

Our approach to managing environmental and social impacts associated with our client relationships is 
informed by globally recognized standards and best practices, including: 

•  Equator Principles 

•  United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 

•  UK Modern Slavery Act 

• 

International Finance Corporation Performance Standards 

•  Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 

As a signatory to the Equator Principles, Wells Fargo is committed to following the requirements of the 
Equator Principles for applicable transactions. We have grown our related financing team and the number of 
transactions closed, which has resulted in Wells Fargo assessing five Power sector and one Oil and Gas sector 
projects in scope of the Equator Principles that were closed during 2022.

Wells Fargo is committed to respecting human rights throughout our operations, products, and services. Our 
efforts are guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights, which identify a responsibility for corporations to respect human rights in their 
operations and through their business relationships, and to provide remedies when adverse impacts to these 
rights occur. 

56 Further information related to our Human Rights Assessment, Human Rights Statement, UK Modern Slavery Act Statement, and the Indigenous Peoples Statement can be found on our Goals and Reporting website.

In 2021, Wells Fargo engaged a third-party law firm with expertise in business and human rights to undertake a 
Human Rights Impact Assessment. In 2022, we published the Priority Recommendations of the Wells Fargo 
Human Rights Impact Assessment and actions in response, as well as our updated Human Rights Statement. 
We outlined our strategies, policies, and programs related to the prevention of modern slavery, including 
human trafficking in the UK Modern Slavery Act Statement. 

Wells Fargo has an Indigenous Peoples Statement guided by the best practices and principles stipulated within 
International Finance Corporation Performance Standard 7, developed in partnership with tribal leaders, 
Indigenous stakeholders, and their representatives. It articulates our commitment to Indigenous communities 
and helps guide our decision-making for transactions where Indigenous communities can be impacted. 

As discussed above, many aspects of Wells Fargo's approach to identification, evaluation, and management of 
human rights impacts associated with our financial relationships are described in our ESIM Framework. 
Consistent with recommendations from the Human Rights Impact Assessment, we have more fully integrated 
our approach to managing environmental and social impacts by further embedding ownership and oversight of 
the ESIM Policy within our Independent Risk Management function. 

We strive to engage with suppliers whose values and business principles reflect respect for the human rights of 
the people with whom, and the communities in which, they do business. While we recognize that each supplier 
has varying policies and approaches to human rights, we expect our suppliers to adhere to the standards and 
values expressed in our Supplier Code of Conduct, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website. 

To drive greater awareness and understanding of human rights principles and issues, we have incorporated a 
new, voluntary human rights training section on our employee learning and development platform. We also aim 
to further educate employees on human rights initiatives and engagement opportunities.

principles, frameworks or preferred practices of any particular investor or other third-party, or reflect market 
trends. Wells Fargo's ESG, sustainability, climate, sustainable investing, or sustainable finance goals, 
commitments, and initiatives are purely voluntary, are not binding on the Company's business, investment 
decisions, and/or management, may be amended or cancelled at any time, and do not constitute a guarantee, 
promise or commitment regarding actual or potential positive impacts or outcomes. 

In particular, among other statements, statements relating to the Company's climate-related goals, targets, 
policies, procedures or positions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, net-zero and related goals) and the 
Company's targets, aims and objectives in connection with those ambitions (including emissions reduction 
targets and objectives), and to the Company's expectations, targets and aims for capital expenditure (including 
the proportion of investment allocated to and capital employed in renewable energy and environmental 
finance investments or sustainable finance investments), are aspirational and not guarantees or promises that 
any goals, targets and objectives will be met or will continue to be pursued. 

Information contained herein is sourced from a variety of internal and external sources and may be based on 
emerging or evolving practices. Similarly, statistics and metrics relating to ESG and climate-related matters are 
estimates and may be based on assumptions and developing standards. In addition, disclosures related to 
environmental sustainability, including disclosures related to the Company’s resource consumption and 
greenhouse gas emissions, as well as certain internal estimates and assumptions, are based in part on third-
party data. Uncertainties, inaccuracies or omissions in any of these inputs potentially have compounding 
effects on the accuracy and completeness of resulting emissions and resource consumption figures. The 
suitability of the design and effectiveness of the third-party systems and associated controls over the accuracy 
and completeness of the data has not been independently assessed. Also, while the Company set sector-
specific targets to enable it to track the alignment of its financing activities to its net-zero goal, these targets, 
even if met, do not guarantee reductions of absolute greenhouse gas emissions in the real economy. The 
companies that emit the greenhouse gases ultimately control that outcome. Relatedly, given the indirect 
nature of financial institution target setting and the challenges of drawing causality between bank financing 
and real economy emission outcomes, these targets should be interpreted as efforts in financial portfolio 
alignment and should not be construed as a commitment to achieve a particular outcome or a claim to realize a 
specific climate effect. 

Accordingly, with respect to data that is not also included in the Company’s Statement of Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions or Management's Assertion with respect to sustainable financing activities, the Company makes no 
representations or warranties as to the quality, completeness, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose and 
shall not be liable for any use by any party of, for any decision made or action taken by any party in reliance 
upon, or for any inaccuracies or errors in, or omissions from, such data. GHG Protocol requires restatement

when changes in calculation methodology or improvements in the accuracy of emissions factors or activity 
data significantly impact the base year emissions data. Since methodologies and approaches continue to 
evolve, information we are currently disclosing could later potentially yield materially different emissions and 
may result in restatement. Other than as stated herein, the Company does not undertake any duty to restate 
or correct data should such information later prove to be incorrect. 

This document provides general information regarding a number of the Company’s policies, procedures, and 
positions relating to ESG issues. Although this document aims to present the general position of the Company, 
the policies, procedures, and positions discussed herein may be subject to approved exceptions. Further, there 
can be no assurance that the Company's policies, procedures, and positions relating to ESG issues will continue; 
such policies, procedures and positions, including initiatives, goals and targets, could change, even materially. 
The Company is permitted to determine in its discretion that it is not feasible or practical to implement or 
complete certain of its policies, procedures, positions, goals or targets relating to ESG issues based on cost, 
timing, or other considerations. Except where indicated, this document and the data contained herein has not 
been verified or otherwise assured by an independent third party. 

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are also aspirational in nature. The analysis 
involved in determining whether and how certain initiatives may contribute to the SDGs is inherently subjective 
and dependent on a number of factors. There can be no assurance that reasonable parties will agree on a 
decision as to whether certain projects, initiatives, investments, or other aspects of our business contribute to a 
particular SDG. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on our application of the SDGs, as such 
application is subject to change at any time and in our sole discretion.

Wells Fargo recognizes that we have a responsibility to do our part to help address the many global challenges 
facing the communities we serve. We are committed to strengthening our business for the future. The United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals, a universal framework for accomplishing 17 desired global outcomes 
by 2030, serves as a guide for integrating sustainability more deeply into our businesses. As part of our 
commitment to communities, we continue to provide both capital and financial solutions, which support the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We have identified the above ten goals as most germane to 
our efforts and referenced them as we defined our sustainability impact areas.

and Standard-aligned Sustainable Finance (inclusion of transactions not captured by Dealogic or Bloomberg and reviewed internally). See details herein. We aim to (as we have done here) obtain a review of 
our progress toward our $500 billion commitment from an independent accounting firm on an annual basis. 

Transactions that are not aligned to a sustainable finance standard but for which the use of proceeds and/or the counterparty can be determined by mapping the use of proceeds to meet an activity to 
support environmental activities as defined by Environmental finance categories.

which are counted as Social.

“Under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), the term low- and moderate-income refers to communities that in certain geographies have income levels that fall between certain ranges, as determined 
by the Census Bureau. A low-income community means there is a median family income of less than 50 percent of the area median income. A moderate-income community means that the median family 
income is at least 50 percent and less than 80 percent of the area median income.” Source: Federal Reserve (https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/cra_resources.htm) Note: Wells Fargo

Independent Accountants’ Review Report

The Board of Directors and Management
Wells Fargo & Company
Wells Fargo Bank N.A.:

We have reviewed management’s assertion on page 93 that approximately $129 billion in sustainable finance activities have been originated, 
committed, advised, or facilitated by Wells Fargo & Company (the “Company”) during the calendar years 2021 and 2022 that meet the 
Sustainable Finance Eligibility Criteria (the “Criteria”) included on pages 84 through 90 of the Wells Fargo Sustainability & Governance Report 
(the “Report”). Reported progress includes transactions that management has identified and determined to meet its Sustainable Finance 
Eligibility Criteria (“Management’s Assertion”). The Company’s management is responsible for its assertion. Our responsibility is to express a 
conclusion on management’s assertion based on our review.

Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in 
AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require 
that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to Management’s 
Assertion in order for it to be fairly stated. The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing from, and are substantially less in 
extent than, an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether Management’s Assertion is fairly stated in 
all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Because of the limited nature of the 
engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an 
examination been performed. We believe that the review evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our 
conclusion.

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the 
engagement.

The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included:

• 

• 

inquiring of management to obtain an understanding of the Company’s sustainable finance activities;

inquiring of management to understand the processes and systems used to aggregate data and prepare the sustainable finance activities
information;

About Wells Fargo ............................................................................

A letter from the Chief Executive Officer......................................

Foreword by the Chief Sustainability Officer ................................

Wells Fargo Company (NYSE: WFC) is a leading financial services company that has approximately 1.9 trillion in assets.

We proudly serve one in three U.S. households and more than 10% of small businesses in the U.S., and we are a leading middle market banking provider in the U.S. Wells Fargo provides a diversified set of banking, investment, and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through our four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth Investment Management.

In the communities we serve, the Company focuses its social impact on building a sustainable, inclusive future for all by supporting housing affordability, small business growth, financial health, and a low carbon economy.

This document contains forward looking statements about our future activities, plans, objectives, expectations, and other future conditions.

More information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements is available on Disclaimer and Forward Looking Statements.

Data herein is as of December 31, 2022, unless otherwise indicated.

Wells Fargo has provided external links within this document for your convenience, but Wells Fargo does not endorse and is not responsible for the content, links, privacy policy, or security policy of these websites.

I’m pleased to share Wells Fargo’s latest Sustainability Governance Report.

In this report, you’ll find an overview of the work we are doing to build a sustainable, inclusive future in the communities we serve.

These efforts span housing affordability, small business growth, financial inclusion, sustainability, and other initiatives.

Making a difference in these areas requires a sustained effort, and we are committed to this work for the long term.

As a company, we are balanced in our approach to environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, issues, and we recognize that consumers and businesses want to do business with a company that has a strong reputation.

A strong reputation is achieved not just from strong financial performance, but from actively supporting employees, customers, and communities especially those most in need.

As I look back at 2022, I’m proud of the progress we’ve made on these priorities, and I feel even better about the opportunities ahead.

I hope you enjoy reading about our progress and where we’re focused in the pages to follow.

Nothing in the banking industry stands still, and Wells Fargo’s journey in sustainability is further proof of this.

We established sustainability goals in 2021 and this past year, we continued our progress toward these goals.

Along the way, we uncovered opportunities, established a framework of impact areas, and enhanced governance to sustain momentum.

This year’s report illustrates our accomplishments and continued path forward.

Progress toward goals Our goal to deploy 500 billion in sustainable finance by 2030 is well underway.

In the first two years of tracking, we've originated, committed, advised, or facilitated approximately 129 billion, funding a growing demand for products and services that are building the low carbon economy and strengthening community resilience.

In addition, since announcing in March of 2021 our goal of net zero greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions by 2050, including financed emissions, Wells Fargo has taken meaningful steps forward.

Across our footprint, we are working to minimize use of energy, water, and other resources, reduce GHG emissions in our operations, and have set refreshed operational sustainability goals for 2023.

And we set interim emissions based targets to guide the alignment of our financing portfolios with our net zero goal.

Impact area framework After establishing our sustainability goals in 2021, we saw a need and an opportunity to establish a framework around the areas where Wells Fargo can create the greatest impact.

The framework serves as a way to align and prioritize our collective efforts.

Wells Fargo reviewed its business profile, competitive position, client base, and footprint.

These elements were mapped alongside the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, as well as global challenges and opportunities related to sustainability and stakeholder expectations.

Our analysis included significant external factors, such as geopolitical impacts on global energy needs and new U.S. incentives for clean energy manufacturing, that are expected to reshape several industries.

This assessment helped us identify several cross cutting sustainability impact areas where we can best apply our expertise, size, and scale to make a positive difference.

They highlight opportunities to collaborate across our own operations and with strategic community impact organizations.

Underlying our sustainability impact areas, we maintain a focus on vulnerable communities’ access to the opportunities associated with a transition to a low carbon economy.

By aligning our sustainability efforts with the framework, we believe we can make an effective impact within Wells Fargo and with our stakeholders.

We’ve used it to share our progress in the first part of this report.

Governance This report also includes details on employee support and corporate governance.

Effective governance helps ensure that Wells Fargo is managed responsibly, incorporating appropriate oversight and risk management aimed at creating long term value for shareholders.

The following report is a snapshot of our sustainability journey, which is a path that supports our business, customers, and communities' transition to a resilient, equitable, and sustainable future.

Wells Fargo’s approach to helping transform and improve the financial health of our communities is a key component of our focus on social impact.

We have made long term philanthropic and commercial investments in low to moderate income communities to help move individuals from financially vulnerable positions to positions of better financial health, where they have improved financial security and freedom of choice now and in the future.

We collaborate with key industry and community groups to practice healthy financial living for the long term.

As part of Wells Fargo’s focus on building an inclusive economy where people have equitable access to economic opportunity, we provide a variety of resources and products to enable individuals to increase their savings, reduce debt, secure healthy credit, and acquire assets in pursuit of their financial goals.

Many of these resources are available through the Financial Health hub.

Examples of our commitment to supporting financial health include the following programs and initiatives.

Hands on Banking is Wells Fargo’s free financial education program intended to teach money management skills for all life stages, where users can learn at their own pace.

The program provides tools to help teachers and nonprofit financial counselors.

In support of this initiative, Wells Fargo employee volunteers deliver financial education in schools and communities.

Our Debt to Income Ratio Calculator allows users to enter income and debt payments, then helps them understand more about what that ratio can mean in their financial health journey.

CollegeSTEPS was created by Wells Fargo to help college students manage their money.

Through this website, college students and recent graduates can access free guidance and resources on relevant topics, such as paying for college, finding scholarships, understanding credit, managing money, and preparing for the next steps in their financial journey after college.

Wells Fargo AssistSM offers a variety of options and support to customers facing financial hardship related to credit cards, home loans, other loans, and other accounts.

Our Credit Close UpSM tool provides personalized tips to help customers manage their FICO Scores and has been leveraged by over 11 million customers.

As part of our efforts to support customers on their journey to financial health, Wells Fargo provides customers with free access to their FICO Scores.

As shown in the table below, in 2022 we helped over 11 million customers access their FICO Scores.

Wells Fargo provides products and services that give our customers choice and flexibility in meeting their financial health needs and tools to help manage their accounts.

Online, mobile, and text banking tools allow customers to monitor account activity, transfer funds, and help avoid overdrafts.

Services include automatic zero balance alerts that notify online banking customers by email if their account balances drop to zero or below.

In addition, we made several changes in 2022 to help millions of customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short term cash needs.

Elimination of Overdraft Protection fund transfers fees and nonsufficient funds fees.

Early Pay Day makes eligible direct deposits available up to two days early.

Extra Day Grace gives customers an extra business day to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees.

Flex Loan is a new digital only, small dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access to funds.

The above actions build on services Wells Fargo has introduced over the past several years, including Clear Access Banking, a consumer banking account with no overdraft fees.

As of year end 2022, we now have over 1.7 million of those accounts, up 48% from a year ago.

Digital active customers includes both online and mobile customers.

For more information about initiatives to support financial health, please see our annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website.

Wells Fargo’s Banking Inclusion Initiative, launched in 2021, is a 10 year commitment to help more people who are unbanked gain access to affordable, mainstream accounts and provide easier access to financial education and guidance.

In low to moderate income community census tracts, we’ve introduced Community Connections Branches designed around the needs of the diverse communities we serve.

Starting in 2022, in designated branches, we redesigned spaces created to deliver one on one consultations, improve digital access, and offer financial health seminars.

Also, as part of the Banking Inclusion Initiative, we announced our collaboration with Operation HOPE4 to launch HOPE Inside centers (which feature Operation HOPE financial coaches) within diverse and low to moderate income neighborhoods.

I felt stuck and I hated living paycheck to paycheck.

I finally feel like I am able to afford a savings account, and I always hear your voice in the back of my head before I spend a dollar telling me, 'Do you really need it, if your life doesn’t depend on it, I don’t know why you’re buying it.

You’re setting yourself up,' and she’s right, I was setting myself up for financial stress.

More information about our impact in 2022 can be found on our Banking Inclusion Initiative website and in our annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website.

The Wells Fargo Financial Capability Grant Program focuses on helping low to moderate income populations set their own financial goals, build savings, reduce debt, acquire financial assets, and establish or improve their credit through one on one financial coaching and counseling.

In 2022, we invested 5.4 million in this program across a variety of agencies, including the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, International Rescue Committee, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, or LISC, and others.

In 2022, our investments in this program helped individuals save 14.1 million and reduce debt by 17.4 million, assisted over 9,500 people in establishing or increasing their credit score, and supported more than 9,800 individuals in acquiring financial assets.

Keyonna, mother of two, used LISC’s Twin Accounts tool to build credit and save money at the same time.

With assistance from her Financial Opportunity Center coach at HumanKind, a LISC partner in Richmond, Virginia, supported by Wells Fargo, Keyonna was able to follow a savings plan, pay off her car loan, and build a brighter financial outlook for her family.

It is the most amazing sensation, knowing homeownership will be possible, shared Edith, who once believed her dream of becoming a homeowner might be out of reach.

Thanks to her hard work and guidance from coaches at The Alliance TX, a LISC partner in Houston, this dream is becoming a reality.

Edith built both her credit and savings through engaging in this program.

Wells Fargo’s Credit Building Grant Program works with nonprofit lenders with a focus on small dollar, credit building loans, rent reporting, credit education, and credit rehabilitation to help low to moderate income people establish or build their credit successfully to ultimately grow savings and reduce debt.

In 2022, we enabled individuals to reduce debt by 10.1 million and helped 10,500 people establish or increase their credit score.

A key partner in this program, Grameen America, serves diverse women entrepreneurs through microloans that help women business owners establish or increase their credit.

One recipient of the Credit Building Grant Program in partnership with Grameen America is Meregilda, who came to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic.

After moving to Brooklyn over 25 years ago, Meregilda opened a restaurant to share her love of traditional Latin dishes from the Caribbean.

Meregilda has been a Grameen America member since 2014.

She’s proud of the growth she’s seen in both her credit score and her business after multiple loan cycles.

To date, Grameen America has provided over 35,000 to Meregilda’s restaurant through 13 microloans.

Meregilda hopes to leverage her savings and good credit to open a second restaurant in Staten Island.

With my loans, I have been able to pay the salaries of new employees, which has allowed me to bring on the extra help I needed at the restaurant.

In collaboration with the International Rescue Committee, or IRC, Wells Fargo supports immigrants and refugees newly settled in the U.S. as they navigate the U.S. banking system.

Wells Fargo provides funding for the IRC's financial coaching and lending (credit building loan) programs.

The staff at the IRC speaks multiple languages to provide financial coaching and counseling to immigrants and refugees from around the world.

The organization also provides access to certain financial products, including a credit building ladder loan to help new citizens build their credit for the first time.

In 2021, Inam arrived in Baltimore, Maryland, from Pakistan.

Inam attended credit information sessions offered through IRC Baltimore's financial capabilities program and signed up for an IRC credit building loan.

Inam and his financial coach met several times to devise a plan to pay down his credit card debt.

Inam bought a truck in March 2022, about one year after arriving in the U.S.

Using it to transport himself and his tools, he has built a successful contracting business and can now employ two other builders.

Inam also used his extra income to clear his debts, and with help from his credit building loan, he has gone from having a poor to an excellent credit ranking in under one year.

Wells Fargo supports the Bank On program, which is led by the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund.

This organization educates unbanked Americans about the benefits of having a bank account and connects consumers to affordable accounts without common barriers, like overdraft fees.

Wells Fargo funds the Bank On program both nationally and locally and provides local engagement and expertise to coalitions in regions across the country to pilot new strategies and approaches that help overcome barriers to banking access in several markets with high concentrations of unbanked households.

This, in turn, helps develop a more seamless path for unbanked communities to navigate the traditional banking system.

Wells Fargo is working to increase access to quality, affordable places to live, especially for individuals and families historically excluded from the housing market.

Since the beginning of 2019, we have donated more than 525 million to help support available and affordable rentals, homeownership, and housing stability.

Additionally in 2022, Wells Fargo announced an expansion of its Dream.Plan.Home closing cost credit, which provides borrowers with an income at or below 80% of the median income in the area where the property is located up to 5,000 to use toward closing costs.

The credit is available in certain counties within 20 markets.

Another Wells Fargo program is Wealth Opportunities Realized Through Homeownership, or WORTH, a 60 million national philanthropy effort to address systemic barriers to homeownership for people of color.

Nationally, WORTH aims to help 40,000 new homeowners of color in eight markets by the end of 2025.

Additionally, the Wells Fargo Foundation announced a 40 million Growing Diverse Housing Developers initiative focused on expanding the growth and success of real estate developers of color, including Black and Latino owned firms.

More information about our commitment to housing affordability and opening new pathways to housing is available in our annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website.

Small businesses strengthen communities, drive economies, and provide millions of jobs across the U.S. Wells Fargo is committed to supporting small businesses and providing access to capital that can help them turn entrepreneurial dreams into successful realities.

Our goal is to be the bank of choice for all small businesses.

To advance that goal, we develop deep relationships and personalized solutions for the small businesses we serve today and catalyze philanthropic programs to help enable equitable access to capital for diverse and women owned small businesses.

Launched in 2020, the multiyear Open for Business Fund, or OFB, delivered approximately 420 million in grants to nonprofits focused on serving small businesses at the community level, with an emphasis on meeting the specific needs of diverse small business owners.

Funded organizations deeply understand the circumstances and needs of small businesses in their communities, and were able to leverage their OFB grants to raise a total of 1.8 billion in grants and debt to meet demands for affordable financial services and technical support for small businesses.

Between 2020 and the end of 2022, OFB grant recipients have supported over 188,000 small businesses that provide nearly 236,000 jobs.

Approximately 79% of these went to diverse owned small businesses.

Que Bonito Mexican and Fashion in Houston is one example of a small business that received critical support.

When the owner, Diana, wanted to grow her business, she joined the Open for Business for Women Entrepreneurs program, led by the Houston Community College Office of Entrepreneurial Initiatives in partnership with the Houston Mexican Consulate, and funded by the OFB.

It was a blessing, Diana said about the knowledge she gained that helped her grow her business.

For me, it’s not a new beginning, but having the confidence to go to the next level.

In 2022, Wells Fargo announced the Small Business Resource Navigator, an online portal helping connect small business owners to potential financing options and technical assistance through Community Development Financial Institutions across the U.S.

The portal was launched in collaboration with the nonprofit Community Reinvestment Fund, USA and was made possible by a Wells Fargo OFB grant.

Since its launch, the Small Business Resource Navigator has introduced nearly 1,200 small businesses, a majority of which self identify as diverse, to potential credit opportunities and technical assistance services provided by Community Development Financial Institutions.

This online tool is designed to simplify and streamline the capital process for time strapped entrepreneurs, helping them quickly and effectively identify their best options.

By visiting bizresourcenavigator.com9 and completing a short questionnaire, business owners can connect to relevant Community Development Financial Institutions or business advisory resources in their area.

Impact data will continue to be tracked through early 2025.

Wells Fargo increased our support for women owned businesses, announcing plans to provide mentorship opportunities for 1,000 women in 2022 through our Connect to More program.

Developed in partnership with the Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center, this initiative provides women entrepreneurs with complimentary access to the Center’s signature 12 week Milestone Circles10 mentorship program where they collectively received roughly 13,000 hours of mentorship support.

Connect to MoreSM participants reported tremendous benefits as a result of the program.

More information about supporting women owned businesses is available at Wells Fargo's Connect to More for Women Entrepreneurs site and in our annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website.

Through my 12 weeks in the Milestone Circles program, I was able to document a lot of processes and standard operating procedures that enabled me to onboard four new team members and step out of being directly involved in every single client deliverable.

This has allowed me to scale my business from 9,000 in revenue to 20,000 in revenue monthly and to a team of 11 amazing humans.

The Milestone Circles program really blew me away with its approach to bridging vision’ with goals.’ The team created an environment for success with exercises that challenged me to really dig deep into our vision, which opened up so many opportunities.

I was able to clearly consider our desired funding journey and received expert feedback from mentors.

As a result, our company has identified funding partners that support our vision and mission.

Wells Fargo believes there is a path forward in the transition to clean energy, which will take time, commitment, and capital to pave.

We are a leading capital provider for the clean energy economy, supporting manufacturing and deployment of key technologies like solar and wind power.

Our finance and tax equity teams support projects ranging from residential rooftop solar to community projects to large utility scale developments.

For our own operations, we have met 100% of our global electricity consumption with renewable energy since 201711, and we aim to continue to transition to long term contracts for new renewable energy sources to meet our future needs.

We expect this approach to provide a more permanent and sustainable path to clean energy and serves as a catalyst for large scale development that will provide new clean energy sources for Wells Fargo and beyond.

The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements.

In this report, we are not using such terms material or materiality as they are used under the securities or other laws of the U.S. or any other jurisdiction, or as they are used in the context of financial statements and financial reporting.

Materiality, for the purposes of this document, should not, therefore, be read as equating to any use of the word in other Wells Fargo reporting or filings.

The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary.

When raw data is unavailable, the Company estimates consumption based on a square foot extrapolation of the average consumption from the most comparable facilities.

Third party data (such as electricity and fuel usage) has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the suitability of the design and effectiveness of the third party systems and associated controls over the accuracy and completeness of the data has not been independently assessed.

This data includes cumulative new renewable energy generation capacity contracted by Wells Fargo.

Some assets have not yet achieved commercial operation and are under construction.

Wells Fargo promotes clean energy usage across our facilities.

Reductions from base year to our Scope 2 GHG, emissions which result primarily from purchased electricity, are supported in part by adding on site solar.

Wells Fargo made progress in 2022 in installing solar energy arrays at our facilities.

Cumulatively through the end of 2022, solar energy facilities had been commissioned at nearly 60 locations in eight U.S. states and two non U.S. countries.

A highlight of our 2022 progress was flipping the switch on a 2 megawatt solar installation at our Jordan Creek campus in Iowa.

Wells Fargo is continuing to develop and install an additional approximately 10 megawatts of new, on site solar generation assets at nearly 30 corporate and retail locations in California, Arizona, and Minnesota through a vendor relationship with Ameresco.

In addition, through the end of 2022, we have entered into over 210 megawatts of long term agreements supporting new sources of renewable energy across 13 U.S. states and two non U.S. countries, helping to create new jobs and advance the resiliency of communities in the process.

Wells Fargo signed multiple clean energy contracts that not only help to meet our own energy needs, but also support projects to deliver new clean options for businesses and households at a regional level.

Wells Fargo's off site solar contract with Salt River Project came online in 2022, supporting our operations in Arizona.

An 8 megawatt subscription agreement signed in 2022 with US Solar in Colorado to build five new community solar gardens, which are projected to generate enough energy to power almost 100 Wells Fargo properties.

Our relationship with US Solar provides early access for Wells Fargo employees to sign up for US Solar's community solar program through Colorado employees' local utility.

In 2022, Wells Fargo built on its status as a significant capital provider for clean energy in the U.S. Our Renewable Energy Environmental Finance team had its largest year ever, deploying 2.7 billion of tax equity capital for renewable power and storage projects, bringing its total lifetime investment to 15.9 billion.

In addition, our renewable energy and asset finance business continued to grow its portfolio of project loans to support a range of renewable energy technologies.

Financed projects include large scale solar installations, as well as distributed projects like commercial and community solar.

Some of these community solar projects are developed to specifically serve low to moderate income households.

In addition to expanding existing businesses, in 2022 we entered new clean energy markets.

For example, Wells Fargo entered the residential solar loan market for the first time, closing a 200 million solar warehousing line with a leading residential solar loan originator.

This financing will allow households to save money through rooftop solar with little or no money down.

Also in 2022, Wells Fargo supported the continued development of battery storage technology and deployment, which is critical to advancing clean energy adoption.

This included providing loans to several renewable energy projects that incorporated storage.

We also invested in storage projects with our tax equity capital to further support this growing market.

Across our footprint, we are working to minimize use of energy, water, and other resources, and reduce GHG emissions in our operations.

Reducing GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) from 2019 levels by 70%.

Reducing total waste stream from 2019 levels by 50%.

Driving new renewable energy projects to meet 100% of annual purchased electricity needs.17.

Wells Fargo plans to achieve these goals by continuing to work to reduce our energy and water consumption, and total waste stream, while maintaining our commitment to the health and well being of our employees and a positive workplace experience.

Across our footprint, we made progress in 2022 toward our ongoing efforts to transition to more renewable energy sources.

We also announced plans to consolidate our office space in the Dallas area with a new 22 acre campus that is expected to produce more energy at that site than it consumes.

More than 3,000 employees will report to the new Dallas campus, expected to open in 2025.

For our new Dallas campus and other construction projects, Wells Fargo continues to use the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, certification framework as a benchmarking tool and to help guide best practices.

The new state of the art campus at the Las Colinas Urban Center will include rooftop solar panels, electric vehicle charging stations, east west orientation, exterior shades, electrochromic glass, grey water storm water reclamation, sustainable building materials, and native plantings that minimize the need for irrigation and fertilizer.

We are focused on consolidating our real estate assets in a way that reduces our environmental impact.

Wells Fargo is also continuously exploring programs that allow us to reduce waste and increase diversion from landfills by expanding efforts like composting, recycling, and other ways to achieve a positive impact.

One example is our long running program to donate used office furniture to nonprofit groups across the country.

From 2014 through 2022, we diverted nearly 12,000 tons of used furniture from landfills by making nearly 3 million worth of in kind donations to more than 600 community organizations.

This extended the useful lives of desks, chairs, and other furniture that may otherwise have been discarded.

Wells Fargo works closely with a third party expert to purchase carbon removal credits18 for Scope 1 and 2 of our operational GHG emissions.

These credit purchases are evaluated against a set of specific quality criteria such as additionality, baseline, and carbon accounting methodology for credit issuance, alongside our potential negative impact on surrounding ecosystems and the length of time carbon is stored.

In addition to the purchase of high quality carbon credits, Wells Fargo recognizes the importance of supporting the advancement of carbon removal through our philanthropic efforts.

We have made grants to help to fund regenerative agriculture, soil health research, forest carbon program advancement, ocean carbon research, and many other meaningful and measurable activities.

For example, a 200,000 grant from Wells Fargo to the Soil Health Academy is helping to advance the adoption of soil health focused regenerative agriculture throughout the U.S.

The remaining portion is certified by the Climate Action Reserve.

Many lines of Wells Fargo's business finance activities promote sustainability in our day to day lives either at home or at work.

Included in the Company’s efforts is our significant consumer EV auto lending business, which now represents nearly 10% of the auto loan portfolio by volume and helps customers across the country move toward clean transportation.

We were also the sole lender on a combined 35 million deal to support Orange EV, a manufacturer and servicer of electric yard trucks used by freight transportation and warehousing companies to move trailers around their properties.

The lights are also being equipped with remote monitoring and control.

Switching to LED lights is expected to reduce energy consumption by more than 50%, while eliminating 38,000 metric tons of GHG emissions annually.20 We also advance sustainability by supporting green buildings21.

Real Estate Capital Europe named Wells Fargo the runner up for its Sustainability Financing Deal of the Year: Europe for a sustainability linked refinancing deal in London.

Also, Wells Fargo led a 3.5 billion sustainability linked revolving credit facility for CBRE, a leading global commercial real estate firm.

The terms of the facility are linked to CBRE’s pledge to increase LEED certified square footage and to convert its fleet of vehicles to electric power.

Wells Fargo appreciates the passion and generosity of our employees and the positive community impact they make through their time, talent, and monetary gifts to multiply the Company’s efforts.

To support the volunteer efforts of our employees, we provide eligible employees with up to 16 hours of paid volunteer time each year to serve the communities where they live and work.

Employees are empowered to dedicate their resources to the unique causes they care about most.

Volunteering in 2022: highlights Global, location based Employee Impact Teams were created within Wells Fargo in spring 2022 by integrating two internal groups, Green Teams and Volunteer Chapters.

Fifty two Employee Impact Teams keep interested employees connected to local volunteer opportunities in their communities, resulting in over 700,000 hours volunteered in 2022.

Our Community Care Grants program recognizes employee gifts of time, talent, and treasure.

Through personal giving or service activities, employees may qualify for up to 2,000 in Community Care Grants per year for their preferred eligible charities.

Employees directed over 14 million in Community Care Grants to charities in 2022.

The Welcome Home Program, introduced in 2022, is a month long employee volunteer initiative focused on the intersection of affordable housing and sustainability across Wells Fargo’s global footprint.

In 2022, over 90 different charity partners received direct volunteer support from employees.

In a single month, the program saw more than 5,000 employees log more than 24,000 hours of volunteer time across 274 volunteer events.

Due to the outstanding success of this initial program, we plan to continue and scale this initiative in 2023.

The Global Fellows Program provides Wells Fargo employees an opportunity to donate their time and professional skills in support of nonprofits in the U.S. and beyond to solve business challenges for selected organizations.

Since 2014, nearly 250 Global Fellows have provided consultation to more than 30 organizations.

In 2022, the program expanded to support 14 projects, including seven projects on behalf of nonprofit grantees of the Wells Fargo Foundation, with fellows completing a total of more than 2,400 volunteer hours.

For example, one team of five Global Fellows volunteered for a project on behalf of the Association for Enterprise Opportunity and Bankers Without Borders and was tasked with evaluating, analyzing, and reporting on the current operations at Association for Enterprise Opportunity to recommend improvements to the organization’s operations to foster growth and efficiency.

Global Fellows came at such a great time in my career.

I feel re energized about my profession and the ways my career experience translates to solve other industry challenges.

This program has also been helpful in recommitting to why I have stayed with Wells Fargo for 18 years.

This master class of six sigma experts significantly elevated our organization’s strategy to a new progressive level of operations.

Many Wells Fargo employees are active in nonprofit board service in the communities where they live and work.

In 2022, we published a board resource guide and partnered with BoardSource, a leading industry organization on board governance, to further support employee board participation.

Employees have access to a host of free resources on board service, interpreting financial information, fundraising, and finding a board that’s right for each individual.

Wells Fargo donated to the Veterans Community Project to build tiny houses in St. Louis for veterans in need of transitional housing.

In addition to a grant of 100,000, Wells Fargo employees volunteered their time to help build these homes for veterans in need.

Our offices in St. Louis also hosted an event to assemble hygiene kits with basic necessities for veterans in the area.

The pause on in person volunteering was lifted in Q2 of 2022.

This adjustment is reflected in the 2020 and 2021 employee giving results for the respective fiscal years.

Many of the financing tools and technologies needed to transition to a low carbon economy already exist and are commercially viable.

However, innovation and advancement are still needed.

In some cases new financing mechanisms must be paired with policies and updated market practices.

And new companies and technologies must be nurtured to push innovation forward and provide the full set of solutions society needs to transition to a low carbon economy.

Today, Wells Fargo offers a range of financing tools to support customers' voluntary adoption of low carbon solutions.

But barriers remain that can make it difficult for some customers to transition.

One example of this is regarding multifamily and affordable housing.

In 2022, we teamed with RMI (formerly Rocky Mountain Institute) to convene key industry experts and practitioners, including leading developers, lenders, policy influencers, and others, to engage in interactive workshops to address the challenges impeding the advancement of affordable low carbon multifamily housing.

Several strategies emerged from the workshops, including providing guidance on how to improve existing climate related data reporting and benchmarking systems, and deploying grants to technical assistance programs.

Wells Fargo is a leading tax equity investor in solar projects.

With our broad range of capabilities and financing solutions spanning markets and customer segments across the globe, Wells Fargo goes beyond project deployment to support the entire solar value chain.

Today, Wells Fargo serves clients that manufacture, distribute, and install solar panels and solar components around the world.

We also provide a suite of financing and investment tools including construction finance, bridge lending, long term asset based loans, asset backed securitization, and tax equity investment.

This work supports everything from large utility scale projects to community solar and individual rooftop projects.

This ecosystem based approach is enabled by close coordination among multiple Wells Fargo teams.

The Wells Fargo Foundation dedicates resources to support philanthropy related to our sustainability priorities.

These initiatives are intended to support an equity focused transition to a low carbon economy with an emphasis on mitigating climate impacts and expanding sustainable finance solutions.

We partner with nongovernmental organizations such as RMI that help advance climate finance solutions, including those focused on low and moderate income communities.

We also support the acceleration and adoption of clean technologies, working with partners nationally, like our collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory through the Wells Fargo Innovation Incubator, or IN2, program.

One example of our philanthropic approach to climate finance is the Wells Fargo Foundation’s support for the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, or LACI.

In 2022, LACI announced the launch of its nationwide LACI Cleantech Debt Fund, a first of its kind green loan program to scale early stage cleantech startups and accelerate equitable climate action.

LACI aims to help underrepresented business founders overcome some of the institutional and historical barriers they face in accessing capital to grow their companies.

The Debt Fund provides non dilutive capital to early stage startups.

Unlike most traditional loans, LACI does not require personal collateral or personal credit scores for underwriting.

To support this important work, Wells Fargo provided grant funding to cover LACI's initial operating costs and loan loss reserves.

Another philanthropic venture is the Wells Fargo Innovation Incubator program, a 50 million collaboration between the Wells Fargo Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

IN provides technical assistance and validation to promising cleantech startups with a goal to quickly and successfully drive innovative technologies to market that lower carbon emissions and better position them for investment.

The IN portfolio includes 65 companies that each receive up to 250,000 in nondilutive capital and research support.

In 2022, IN launched the program’s first all demonstration cohort, meaning each of the five startups chosen will complete the program with an actual demonstration of their technologies.

To boost impact, IN fosters an ecosystem of expertise and support.

The IN Channel Partner network includes more than 60 incubators, accelerators, and universities that mentor and refer companies to the program.

The Wells Fargo IN board of directors reviews applicants, providing a business perspective as part of the decision making process.

Two external advisory boards, the Commercial Buildings and Housing Board and the Sustainable Agriculture Board, select the final participants.

The Farmers Business Network, an IN2 partner, provides field trial opportunities and exposure to commercial markets to agtech startups.

In 2016, IN launched the 5 million Channel Partner Award program to support events, strategic meetings and trainings, and large collaborative initiatives between the Channel Partners.

The program expanded in 2020 and will deliver an additional 5 million in Channel Partner Awards through 2024.

As part of Wells Fargo’s commitment to sustainability, we maintain a focus on vulnerable communities, helping them mitigate climate impacts and gain access to sustainable finance solutions.

Multifamily and single family housing contribute significantly to overall emissions from the building sector, however efforts to reduce emissions in affordable housing are nascent and complex.

To help address this challenge, Wells Fargo has provided grants to support and accelerate efforts that couple climate related principles with affordable housing.

This combination helps improve community and individual household resilience in the face of volatility brought on by climate change, extreme weather events, and increases in utility costs.

For example, a 1.5 million grant from Wells Fargo to the Inclusiv Smart E Loan program will help community development credit unions accelerate affordable sustainable financing for low and moderate income communities in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

The Smart E Loan program vets contractors and potential sustainable projects, and provides technical assistance to community development credit unions to help expand lending to their customers.

An important goal of the program is for low income households to access energy efficiency and decarbonization projects that help improve their homes and lower utility costs.

In another example, the Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future leveraged a grant from Wells Fargo to create a tool that allows affordable housing portfolio owners to calculate their annual GHG emissions.

With this calculator, Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future hopes to equip partners and other affordable multifamily portfolio owners with the necessary tools to establish credible baselines of their GHG emissions footprint and make informed decisions on how to reduce their overall emissions.

Advancing climate resiliency in communities across the U.S.

Wells Fargo recognizes that the impact of climate change can affect some communities more than others.

As part of Wells Fargo’s focus on climate resiliency, we collaborated with the Institute for Sustainable Communities and the Tides Foundation to launch the Dismantling Energy Inequity in Communities of Color program in 2022 (announced in early 2023).

The initiative was enabled by a 2.85 million grant from the Wells Fargo Foundation to create more equitable access to clean and affordable energy and improve climate resiliency in historically excluded communities.

From this initiative, the Institute for Sustainable Communities created a national cohort across 10 U.S. cities, leveraging the expertise of Black , Brown , and Indigenous led community based organizations to develop weather resilient, solar powered community centers, known as resilience hubs.

These hubs will serve as gathering places for community members in times of joy with support through educational and social programs and in times of climate related and severe weather crisis including flooding and power outages as cooling centers in the summer and heat shelters in the winter.

Wells Fargo also provided a grant to The Greenlining Institute to support the California Strategic Growth Council's Transformative Climate Communities program implementation in the city of Stockton, California.

The grant will support the community driven application of Stockton’s Sustainable Neighborhood Plan, which includes water efficiency upgrades, urban tree canopy development to mitigate heat island effects, and energy efficiency upgrades for low income households.

In 2021, we launched the Wells Fargo Institute for Sustainable Finance, which supports clients and communities in accelerating the transition to an equitable, low carbon economy.

The Institute publishes research, surveys, and articles, and convenes subject matter experts for roundtables and workshops.

The goal is to identify proven and emerging approaches to increase sustainable financing and community investment opportunities, including the deployment of 500 billion in sustainable financing by 2030.

The Institute also serves as a resource for employees, hosting employee learning sessions and webinars and publishing content relevant to their professional and personal lives, such as a briefing on how the federal Inflation Reduction Act can create potential business opportunities for our bank.

Through a year long collaboration with the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Wells Fargo embarked on an initiative to educate mayors and business leaders on best practices to address and reduce the impacts of climate change in their communities.

Following a series of engagements with mayors and a workshop with city representatives and public and private sector organizations, the U.S. Conference of Mayors published a white paper, Investing in Resilient and Equitable Neighborhoods, exploring how multisector efforts can reduce emissions and prepare communities for future risks.

Wells Fargo is making progress on our goals and actions while driving impact along the journey to a resilient, equitable, and sustainable future.

At Wells Fargo, we strive to align our resources and expertise to make a positive impact in communities, address complex societal issues, and help build a more inclusive, sustainable future for all.

We aspire to strengthen historically underserved communities by investing in pathways to economic advancement and generational wealth.

We provide grants to nonprofit organizations working to strengthen the resiliency of our communities and our planet with a focus on supporting nonprofits that strategically align with our funding priorities: financial health, housing access and affordability, small business growth, and sustainability.

Wells Fargo's second Inclusive Communities and Climate Bond, a 2 billion bond, supported sustainable finance efforts for projects and programs that contribute to housing affordability, economic opportunity, renewable energy, and clean transportation.

The Company was recognized at the 8th Climate Bonds Awards for the Largest Financial Corporate Sustainability Bond of 2022 by the Climate Bonds Initiative.

More information about the Inclusive Communities and Climate Bond is available in our annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website.

In 2022, Wells Fargo continued to leverage its broad range of products, solutions, and capabilities across our lines of business to drive financing toward sustainable activities.

This included using existing financing tools that have long been a strength of Wells Fargo, including commercial and consumer lending, equipment finance, and debt underwriting.

We also drove capital through business units built from the ground up to serve sustainability objectives.

These include Community Lending Investment, Renewable Energy Environmental Finance, and Sustainable Finance Advisory.

Focus area categorization is based on the primary assigned focus area of each grant at the time of application.

Grants with multiple focus areas are shown only under their primary area of focus.

As Wells Fargo grows its sustainable finance activities, we strive to produce transparent and accurate reporting.

To that end, we provide a breakdown of sustainable finance volume (see below), and measure progress toward our 500 billion goal based on our Sustainable Finance Eligibility Criteria ( the criteria ), which is included in the Appendix of this report.

Wells Fargo defines sustainability to include both environmental and social transactions.

The criteria are designed to capture transactions where the funds are used for sustainable activities, including transactions with features that encourage qualifying sustainable activities.

These premises align with the Company’s continued focus on delivering benefits to our clients, customers, and communities.

During the calendar years 2021 and 2022, Wells Fargo originated, committed, advised, or facilitated approximately 129 billion in sustainable finance activities, representing approximately 26% of our commitment to deploy 500 billion of sustainable finance between 2021 and 2030.

Wells Fargo’s sustainable finance activity is divided into three categories: standard aligned sustainable finance, environmental finance, and social finance.

Approximately 57% of our progress through 2022 supported standard aligned sustainable finance, while close to 28% went to environmental finance, and around 15% supported social finance.

For each of our first two years of progress toward our 500 billion goal, we obtained limited assurance27 on our assertion of the total amount of sustainable finance activities originated, committed, advised, or facilitated that meet the criteria28.

See Sustainable Finance Eligibility Criteria in the Appendix for more details.

See Sustainable Finance Eligibility Criteria in the Appendix of this report for more details.

In 2022, the U.S. passed the Inflation Reduction Act, one of the largest climate and clean energy policies in the world.

The Inflation Reduction Act provides an estimated 369 billion in federal incentives to support clean energy deployment, vehicle electrification, cleantech manufacturing, industrial decarbonization, and commercialization of key new energy solutions like green hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration.

These incentives are expected to mobilize more than 1 trillion of private investment this decade.

Clients across sectors have already reached out regarding potential financing solutions and information related to obtaining Inflation Reduction Act benefits on new projects.

We are providing briefings to clients and teams internally to raise awareness.

The Company is also directly engaging with policymakers to inform program design and encouraging effective implementation.

We will continue to monitor Inflation Reduction Act developments, keep clients informed, and look for opportunities to serve clients and participate in these growing markets.

As noted earlier in this report, Wells Fargo is working to employ tactics to drive efficiencies and responsible resource use.

Through our ongoing efforts, we aim to reduce the GHG emissions, water and energy consumption, and waste associated with our operations.

Notably, in 2022, we saw increases in our resource usage and emissions output as more people returned to the office after the height of the COVID 19 pandemic.

Wells Fargo continues efforts to consolidate our real estate portfolio and employ additional steps to minimize waste and conserve energy as we work to meet our refreshed operational sustainability goals.

Numbers may differ from other Wells Fargo reports that count employees based on full time equivalent methodology.

Excludes square footage from land and parking lots.

In previous years, the deposit bags and confidential paper shred weight was reported together.

Greenhouse gas emissions Wells Fargo calculates our operational Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by an organization.

Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling, and are a result of the organization's energy use.

Wells Fargo's Statement of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website, has been reviewed by an independent accountant for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2022.

The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements.

The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary.

When raw data is unavailable, the Company estimates consumption based on a square foot extrapolation of the average consumption from the most comparable facilities.

Third party data (such as electricity and fuel usage) has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the suitability of the design and effectiveness of the third party systems and associated controls over the accuracy and completeness of the data has not been independently assessed.

A market based method reflects emissions from electricity that Wells Fargo has purposefully chosen.

It derives emission factors from contractual instruments, which include any type of contract between two parties for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation, or for unbundled attribute claims.

A portion of these credits are Verified Carbon Standard (VSC) certified and have also achieved the add on Climate, Community and Biodiversity (CCB) certification and are therefore VSC CCB certified.

The remaining portion is certified by the Climate Action Reserve (CAR).

Wells Fargo's Statement of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website, has been reviewed by an independent accountant for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2022.

Wells Fargo’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website, outlines our expectation that suppliers not only comply with applicable laws, regulations, and contract terms, but also conduct themselves with the highest standards of ethical business practices.

We encourage our suppliers to join us in implementing systems designed to minimize negative impacts on the environment.

Wells Fargo works with suppliers to understand their environmental and social considerations.

As an example, the below table shows our engagement of certain suppliers to report their environmental data through CDP’s questionnaires to better understand their emissions profile and approach to climate resiliency.

Live our expectations...................................................................................

Support for employees................................................................................

Corporate governance and ethics ..............................................................

Wells Fargo is committed to a culture that attracts and retains the best people who help us become a better, stronger company.

Our culture is reinforced by a set of core expectations that play a vital role in our transformation journey.

These Company Expectations apply to all employees at Wells Fargo they reinforce the highest standards of integrity and operational excellence and guide how we collaborate and execute as a team embrace our differences simplify and improve the work that we deliver and develop, recognize, and inspire our employees to achieve performance excellence.

Employee feedback has contributed significantly to enhancing our culture and improving the employee experience in recent years.

Employees can share their voices and valuable insights in several ways throughout the year including town hall meetings with leaders, surveys, and an employee feedback platform called Loudspeaker, which was introduced in 2021.

To date, employees have submitted thousands of ideas and recommendations, many of which have been implemented, leading to efficiencies and innovation, and furthering employee engagement.

Wells Fargo is committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion with a belief that a company's workforce should reflect the customers they serve and the U.S. population more broadly.

In addition to focusing on diversity across our workforce, we support strategic opportunities that include diverse suppliers in competitive sourcing and procurement opportunities within our supply chain, along with efforts to support diverse customers.

More information about our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, including data on our representation, hires, promotions, turnovers, and support for diverse customers, is available in our annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website.

Wells Fargo believes it takes the best talent available to deliver the best the industry has to offer.

And that means focusing on every aspect of being an employer of choice.

Wells Fargo delivers a broad range of benefits designed to support employees when and where they need help most.

We provide compelling opportunities for employees to connect and work together to strengthen themselves and their communities.

And we actively work to instill a culture where individuals matter, teamwork is rewarded, flexibility is valued, and people are respected.

Competitive and fair compensation is a priority for Wells Fargo and our employees.

Compensation is linked to Company, business group, and individual performance, including meeting regulatory expectations and creating long term value consistent with the interests of shareholders.

Compensation promotes effective risk management and discourages imprudent or excessive risk taking.

Wells Fargo is focused on attracting and retaining talent.

Compensation helps to attract, motivate, and retain people with the skills, talent, and experience to drive superior long term Company performance.

Wells Fargo is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices and, since 2015, has conducted an annual pay equity review through engagement with a third party expert.

The review analyzes employee compensation, taking into account gender, race, and ethnicity, and factors such as role, tenure, and geography.

The review process can include compensation adjustments in the event we identify pay gaps.

The 2022 review, modified for adjustments as described, showed that globally, women at Wells Fargo earn more than 99 cents for every 1 earned by their male peers, and U.S. employees who are racially ethnically diverse earn more than 99 cents for every 1 earned by their white peers.

Wells Fargo provides eligible full time and part time employees with a comprehensive set of benefits designed to support their physical, mental, and financial health.

We also provide employees with a variety of competitive employer paid financial protection benefits, including life insurance, short and long term disability coverage, and business travel accident insurance.

In some countries, we provide additional plans that extend health insurance coverage and long term disability coverage, as well as flexible benefits options, such as personal accident coverage.

Employees in the U.S. have an opportunity to participate in the 401(k) Plan and receive up to a 6% match to help save for the future.

Employees earning less than 75,000 a year receive an automatic 401(k) Plan contribution of 1% of pay.

U.S. employees may also participate in a stock purchase plan and take advantage of discounts on financial products, home mortgages, and more.

In 2022, Wells Fargo launched Well Life, a new employer brand strategy to attract and retain high performing talent.

Well Life promotes holistic living that improves overall quality of life.

It fosters a sense of community among coworkers by providing support and motivation to work toward common well being goals.

The Well Life is for and about Wells Fargo employees It's the expression of the passion, dedication, and spirit that our employees bring to work every day and all the good things that come from being a part of this great Company.

It's our hope that employees see themselves reflected in the Well Life.

Wells Fargo offers comprehensive and competitive medical benefits, as well as dental and vision benefits in many countries.

U.S. medical plans offer preventive care services covered at 100%, prescription drug benefits, and a network of doctors and hospitals to help employees and their families maintain their health.

Employees enrolled in certain U.S. medical plans can earn up to 800 in health and wellness dollars annually for completing wellness related activities.

Eligible spouses and domestic partners can earn an additional 400 in health and wellness dollars.

In addition, Wells Fargo contributes up to 1,000 into a health savings account for U.S. employees earning less than 45,000 who are enrolled in certain medical plans.

Employees earning 45,000 to 100,000 who are enrolled in certain medical plans receive up to 500 in a health savings account.

Wells Fargo is committed to creating a safe, inclusive environment where differences are respected and embraced.

In 2022, we launched a comprehensive campaign designed to reduce the stigma around mental health, support employee well being, and promote mental health resources available to employees and their families.

The campaign began with a focus on managers, offering tips, educational information, and a conversation guide to help managers normalize the topic.

While resources available to employees vary across the globe, in the U.S. and in some other countries these include a mental health mobile app, one on one wellness coaching, and in person and virtual counseling through Wells Fargo’s medical plan benefits.

Employees in all countries have access to counseling support available through the Employee Assistance Program.

Wells Fargo provides extensive benefits for employees who are starting families.

This team provides access to experienced HR professionals who help to educate, equip, and empower managers to more effectively lead their teams.

Support includes interpretation and application of HR related policies, and strategies for coaching and managing employee performance, talent management, and optimizing team dynamics.

Caring for employees in times of transition As Wells Fargo continues transforming our businesses, we recognize that employees may be impacted, and we provide transparent communication about the programs and opportunities they can access for support.

In some cases, organizational restructuring results in employee displacements or job eliminations because of economic or operational factors.

Wells Fargo’s Displacement Policy requires that all displaced employees in the U.S. are provided a 60 day notice period, unless otherwise required by federal, state, or local laws.

Regardless of working or nonworking status, employees are still considered employed during the entire notice period.

Employees are eligible for a minimum of eight weeks of severance and up to 52 weeks, based on their completed years of service, during which they will also have continued access to health coverage.

We also offer displaced employees access to career transition services through a third party service provider that offers career coaching, professional resume writing, connections to hiring managers and recruiters, and interviewing practices.

In countries where we operate outside of the U.S., the practices of managing redundancies and workforce restructuring vary based on legal and regulatory requirements and local market practices.

International support may include enhanced severance pay arrangements, employee assistance programs, and career transition services.

Training on harassment and discrimination is provided annually to employees.

Doing what is right for customers must be at the center of all our actions.

We have taken important steps to embed this mindset into all of our decisions, which feeds into all the ways in which we touch customers.

This extends from product design and pricing to our coverage and service models and how we approach complaints and remediations.

We recognize that our actions speak much louder than our words.

Wells Fargo established the Office of Consumer Practices in 2021 as a Companywide, consumer focused advisory group within the Chief Operating Office.

We recognize the risks to protecting personal data in a fast paced global economy with evolving technology, a robust regulatory environment, and a socially aware and sophisticated global community.

Like many companies, Wells Fargo engages in public policy advocacy on issues that impact our business at the local, state, and federal levels, including through membership in financial services industry trade associations.

We regularly review our participation model and believe that engagement through these trade organizations, even potentially as a voice of opposition from time to time, is an integral part of our public policy strategy and best serves our customers, Company, employees, and communities.

Participation in these groups comes with the understanding that we may not always agree with every position taken.

In instances where we identify significant misalignment with trade associations to which we belong, we aim to share our perspective in a constructive manner.

Additionally, we are not members of any tax exempt organization in the U.S. that is primarily organized to write, endorse, and promote model legislation.

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators, and other stakeholders.

Risk is the possibility of an event occurring that could adversely affect our ability to achieve strategic or business objectives.

We routinely take risks, within our risk appetite and approved exceptions, to achieve our business goals and serve our customers.

These risks include financial risks, such as interest rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and nonfinancial risks, such as operational risk (which includes compliance and model risks), and strategic and reputation risks.

Every employee, in the course of their daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing risk.

Every employee has a role to play in risk management, including establishing and maintaining our control environment.

Every employee must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Company policies.

Senior management sets the tone at the top by supporting a strong culture, defined by Wells Fargo’s expectations and Code of Conduct, that guides how employees conduct themselves and make decisions.

The Board oversees senior management in establishing and maintaining this culture and effectively managing risk.

Senior management expects employees to speak up when they see something that could cause harm to our customers, communities, employees, shareholders, or reputation.

Because risk management is everyone’s responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their concerns when they have not been addressed.

Wells Fargo’s performance management and incentive compensation programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk and reward under core principles that employees are expected to know and practice.

Effective risk management is a central component of employee performance evaluations.

The Company has three lines of defense for managing risk: the Front Line, Independent Risk Management, and Internal Audit.

Each line of defense has distinct risk management responsibilities.

Front Line: The Front Line, which comprises our principal lines of businesses and certain enterprise function activities, is the first line of defense.

The Front Line is responsible for understanding the risks generated by its activities, applying adequate controls, and managing risk in the course of its business activities.

Independent Risk Management: Independent Risk Management is the second line of defense.

It establishes and maintains the Company’s risk management program and provides oversight of, including challenge to and independent assessment and monitoring of, the Front Line’s execution of its risk management responsibilities.

Internal Audit: Internal Audit is the third line of defense.

It is responsible for acting as an independent assurance function and validates that the risk management program is adequately designed and functioning effectively.

Wells Fargo’s Risk Management Framework sets forth our core principles for managing and governing risk.

It is approved by the Board’s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually.

Many other documents and policies flow from its core principles.

Climate risk management Wells Fargo is committed to helping mitigate the impacts of climate change related to our activities and to partnering with key stakeholders, including communities and customers, to do the same.

Wells Fargo considers climate change to be a driver of various risk types we manage, and we will continue to integrate climate considerations into our Risk Management Framework as our understanding of climate change and the risks driven by it evolve.

More information about our climate related risk management is available in the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures Report, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website.

Bank Secrecy Act and Anti Money Laundering program Wells Fargo’s risk based global Bank Secrecy Act and Anti Money Laundering, or BSA AML, program is designed to comply with applicable BSA AML laws commensurate with our risk profile.

The BSA AML program is approved by our Board of Directors through its Risk Committee.

The BSA AML program encompasses requirements specifically related to BSA AML compliance risks and includes the following core elements: BSA officer, policies, risk assessments, gap analyses, testing, training, data analytics, customer due diligence, sanctions screening, transaction monitoring, reporting, other internal controls, and Internal Audit.

Compliance with economic sanctions laws and regulations Wells Fargo has implemented a comprehensive risk based sanctions compliance program designed to facilitate compliance with applicable economic sanctions laws and regulations in every jurisdiction in which we operate.

Anti Bribery and Corruption Compliance Program Wells Fargo has zero tolerance for bribery and corruption in any form and has implemented a global risk based Anti Bribery and Corruption Compliance Program designed to confirm adherence to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and applicable anti bribery and corruption laws in the jurisdictions where Wells Fargo does business.

The Anti Bribery and Corruption Compliance Program prohibits the offering or accepting of anything of value to improperly influence the performance of the recipient's duties, obtain or retain business, or otherwise gain an unfair advantage.

Environmental and Social Impact Management Framework As part of our dedication to a strong risk culture, Wells Fargo recognizes that environmental and social issues have the potential to impact various risk types covered by our Risk Management Framework, including reputation risk, credit risk, and strategic risk.

Our Environmental and Social Impact Management Framework55, or ESIM Framework, is designed to provide clarity and transparency to our stakeholders about how we approach the environmental and social impacts associated with certain financial relationships.

It is intended to reflect key objectives from our ESIM Policy, which establishes expectations and requirements for identifying, assessing, and managing actual and potential environmental and social adverse impacts associated with certain commercial clients and financings.

In accordance with the ESIM Policy, Wells Fargo requires additional environmental and social impact due diligence for certain clients in the following sectors: arms and armaments, consumer finance, projects in scope of the Equator Principles, coal and metal mining operations, and oil and gas operations.

Additionally, the ESIM Policy also contains certain restrictions that are in line with our existing risk management processes.

For example, business groups may not knowingly engage in certain commercial transactions involving companies deriving the majority of their revenues from coal mining extraction or mountaintop removal coal operations projects associated with the expansion of an existing, or development of a new, coal mine, or development of a new coal fired power plant projects in the Alaska Arctic region in scope of the Equator Principles modern slavery forced or compulsory labor (including child labor) human trafficking private prison companies and immigrant detention centers.

United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures.

As a signatory to the Equator Principles, Wells Fargo is committed to following the requirements of the Equator Principles for applicable transactions.

We have grown our related financing team and the number of transactions closed, which has resulted in Wells Fargo assessing five Power sector and one Oil and Gas sector projects in scope of the Equator Principles that were closed during 2022.

Human rights56 Wells Fargo is committed to respecting human rights throughout our operations, products, and services.

Our efforts are guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which identify a responsibility for corporations to respect human rights in their operations and through their business relationships, and to provide remedies when adverse impacts to these rights occur.

In 2021, Wells Fargo engaged a third party law firm with expertise in business and human rights to undertake a Human Rights Impact Assessment.

In 2022, we published the Priority Recommendations of the Wells Fargo Human Rights Impact Assessment and actions in response, as well as our updated Human Rights Statement.

We outlined our strategies, policies, and programs related to the prevention of modern slavery, including human trafficking in the UK Modern Slavery Act Statement.

Wells Fargo has an Indigenous Peoples Statement guided by the best practices and principles stipulated within International Finance Corporation Performance Standard 7, developed in partnership with tribal leaders, Indigenous stakeholders, and their representatives.

It articulates our commitment to Indigenous communities and helps guide our decision making for transactions where Indigenous communities can be impacted.

As discussed above, many aspects of Wells Fargo's approach to identification, evaluation, and management of human rights impacts associated with our financial relationships are described in our ESIM Framework.

Consistent with recommendations from the Human Rights Impact Assessment, we have more fully integrated our approach to managing environmental and social impacts by further embedding ownership and oversight of the ESIM Policy within our Independent Risk Management function.

We strive to engage with suppliers whose values and business principles reflect respect for the human rights of the people with whom, and the communities in which, they do business.

While we recognize that each supplier has varying policies and approaches to human rights, we expect our suppliers to adhere to the standards and values expressed in our Supplier Code of Conduct, which can be found on our Goals and Reporting website.

To drive greater awareness and understanding of human rights principles and issues, we have incorporated a new, voluntary human rights training section on our employee learning and development platform.

We also aim to further educate employees on human rights initiatives and engagement opportunities.

The Company does not undertake to update this document, or any other information contained in this document, to reflect changes or events that occur after that date.

This information is not a guarantee of future results, occurrences, performance, or conditions.

This document contains forward looking statements about our business, including discussion of the Company’s plans, objectives and strategies, and expectations for our operations and business related to our environmental, social, and governance activities.

Because forward looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding the future, they are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties.

Do not unduly rely on forward looking statements as actual results could differ materially from expectations.

Forward looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we do not undertake to update them to reflect changes or events that occur after that date.

For information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on its website at www.sec.gov57.

While this document describes events, including potential future events that may be generally significant in the context of our ESG priorities and related activities, any such significance does not necessarily equate to the level of materiality of disclosures required under U.S. federal securities laws.

This document should not be used as a basis for trading in the securities of the Company or for any other investment decision and should not be construed as consisting of investment advice.

The Company is not providing any financial, economic, legal, accounting, or tax advice or recommendations.

This document reflects certain positions and approaches to ESG as of the date of this document that are subject to change at any time in the Company’s sole discretion without notice, and we do not undertake to update this document to reflect any such changes.

Any references to sustainable investing, sustainable financing, ESG, or similar terms in this document are intended as references to the internally defined criteria of the Company, as applicable, and, except as specifically stated, not to any jurisdiction specific regulatory definition that may exist.

Wells Fargo has provided this link for your convenience, but does not endorse and is not responsible for the content, links, privacy policy, or security policy of this website.

Wells Fargo's ESG, sustainability, climate, sustainable investing, or sustainable finance goals, commitments, and initiatives are purely voluntary, are not binding on the Company's business, investment decisions, and or management, may be amended or cancelled at any time, and do not constitute a guarantee, promise or commitment regarding actual or potential positive impacts or outcomes.

In particular, among other statements, statements relating to the Company's climate related goals, targets, policies, procedures or positions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, net zero and related goals) and the Company's targets, aims and objectives in connection with those ambitions (including emissions reduction targets and objectives), and to the Company's expectations, targets and aims for capital expenditure (including the proportion of investment allocated to and capital employed in renewable energy and environmental finance investments or sustainable finance investments), are aspirational and not guarantees or promises that any goals, targets and objectives will be met or will continue to be pursued.

Information contained herein is sourced from a variety of internal and external sources and may be based on emerging or evolving practices.

Similarly, statistics and metrics relating to ESG and climate related matters are estimates and may be based on assumptions and developing standards.

In addition, disclosures related to environmental sustainability, including disclosures related to the Company’s resource consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as certain internal estimates and assumptions, are based in part on third party data.

Uncertainties, inaccuracies or omissions in any of these inputs potentially have compounding effects on the accuracy and completeness of resulting emissions and resource consumption figures.

The suitability of the design and effectiveness of the third party systems and associated controls over the accuracy and completeness of the data has not been independently assessed.

Also, while the Company set sector specific targets to enable it to track the alignment of its financing activities to its net zero goal, these targets, even if met, do not guarantee reductions of absolute greenhouse gas emissions in the real economy.

The companies that emit the greenhouse gases ultimately control that outcome.

Relatedly, given the indirect nature of financial institution target setting and the challenges of drawing causality between bank financing and real economy emission outcomes, these targets should be interpreted as efforts in financial portfolio alignment and should not be construed as a commitment to achieve a particular outcome or a claim to realize a specific climate effect.

Accordingly, with respect to data that is not also included in the Company’s Statement of Greenhouse Gas Emissions or Management's Assertion with respect to sustainable financing activities, the Company makes no representations or warranties as to the quality, completeness, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose and shall not be liable for any use by any party of, for any decision made or action taken by any party in reliance upon, or for any inaccuracies or errors in, or omissions from, such data.

Since methodologies and approaches continue to evolve, information we are currently disclosing could later potentially yield materially different emissions and may result in restatement.

Other than as stated herein, the Company does not undertake any duty to restate or correct data should such information later prove to be incorrect.

This document provides general information regarding a number of the Company’s policies, procedures, and positions relating to ESG issues.

Further, there can be no assurance that the Company's policies, procedures, and positions relating to ESG issues will continue such policies, procedures and positions, including initiatives, goals and targets, could change, even materially.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are also aspirational in nature.

The analysis involved in determining whether and how certain initiatives may contribute to the SDGs is inherently subjective and dependent on a number of factors.

There can be no assurance that reasonable parties will agree on a decision as to whether certain projects, initiatives, investments, or other aspects of our business contribute to a particular SDG.

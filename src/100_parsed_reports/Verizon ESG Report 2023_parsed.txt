About this report
 

This report details our ESG performance and contains non-financial 
disclosures covering the period from January 1, 2023, through 
December 31, 2023, unless otherwise stated. The inclusion of 
information contained in this report should not be construed as a 
characterization of the materiality or financial impact of that information. 
Our financial disclosures for this period can be found in our 2023 Annual 
Report on Form 10-K. 

This report covers all of Verizon’s operations included in the 2023 
financial statements, unless otherwise stated. On November 23, 2021, 
we completed the acquisition of TracFone Wireless, Inc. (TracFone). 
The reported metrics related to greenhouse gas emissions, on-site 
renewable energy, fleet fuel, water, waste and carbon abatement do not 
include TracFone results. Where relevant, data measurement techniques, 
the bases of calculations and changes in the basis for reporting or 
reclassifications of previously reported data are included as footnotes. 

Note on non-financial reporting 

Non-financial information is subject to measurement uncertainties 
resulting from limitations inherent in the nature of, and the methods used 
for determining, such data. Some of our disclosures in this report are 
based on assumptions due to these inherent measurement uncertainties. 
The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can 
result in materially different measurements. The precision of different 
measurement techniques may also vary. 

Data assurance 

Annually, Verizon obtains independent assurance of our emissions 
profile, as well as other select ESG indicators and analyses. Read the 

assurance reports for more information. For information that is not 
specifically identified as being independently assured, Verizon relies on 
the application of internal policies (including those requiring the creation 
and maintenance of accurate records and the establishment of internal 
controls over externally reported financial and non-financial information) 
and compliance with data quality standards and verification procedures 
set forth in our ESG information governance and control frameworks to 
validate such information. 

Forward-looking statements 

Given the inherent uncertainty in predicting and modeling future 
conditions, caution should be exercised when interpreting the 
information provided. In this report, we have made forward-looking 
statements, including statements regarding our ESG goals, targets, 
commitments and other business objectives. These statements are 
based on our estimates and assumptions and are subject to risks and 
uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include information about 
our possible or assumed future results of operations and include 
statements using words such as “aims,” “anticipates,” “believes,” 
“estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “may,” “plans,” “strategy,” “target,” 
“goal” or similar terms. For those statements, we claim the protection of 
the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private 
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We undertake no obligation to 
revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-
looking statements, except as required by law. Given these risks and 
uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such 
forward-looking statements. For a list of important factors that could 
affect future results and could cause those results to differ materially 
from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, refer to 
Verizon’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Verizon 2023 ESG ReportMessage from our Chairman and CEO 

At Verizon, running our business responsibly is the foundation of our strategy, driving long-term financial success by building a more sustainable future for our shareholders, customers, employees and society. 

Operating as a responsible business is essential to 
earning our customers’ trust and building a world-
class brand. By championing digital responsibility and 
inclusion, promoting diversity, mitigating climate risk 
and creating meaningful work for our employees, we 
are forging a purpose-driven and resilient business, 
with long-term growth and strong financial stability. 

Citizen Verizon, our company-wide responsible 
business plan, is an investment in the communities 
we serve that helps our customers today and builds 
our customer base for tomorrow. We believe that 
Verizon and society benefit when everyone can 
meaningfully participate in the digital economy 
and have set ambitious goals to spur economic 
advancement in the communities where we live and 
work, including a commitment to provide 10 million 
youths with digital skills training by 2030. I am proud 
to share that, through our transformative Verizon 
Innovative Learning initiative, we have provided over 
7 million students nationwide with digital tools and 
resources so far. 

We know that responsible business is good business, 
and our approach to climate considerations is tied 
to, and embedded in, our business strategy and 

operations. Our green bond program allows us to 
finance our renewable energy program on terms that 
are often less expensive than our typical bonds. 

Since we are a major consumer of renewables, our 
moves here also encourage the greening of the 
electric grid and the development of a renewable 
energy economy that will serve our needs, along with 
society’s. In support of this effort, we have a target to 
source 100% of the energy we use in our networks 
from renewables by 2030. 

Of course, none of these accomplishments would be 
possible without the tireless efforts of our V Team. 
Delivering on Verizon’s strategy takes more than the 
best technology; it takes the best people. Providing 
our V Teamers with the skills to execute on our 
business priorities, offering opportunities for career 
advancement and ensuring a collaborative and 
inclusive work environment gives us a competitive 
edge now and into the future. 

We believe integrity is at the core of who we are. 
Verizon has dedicated cross-functional teams to 
execute responsible business principles in our 
core operations, from our supply chain to product 

development to our stewardship of customer 
information. These teams identify and manage 
the evolving risks and opportunities presented by 
our dynamic operating environment, including in 
technology such as artificial intelligence (AI). In 
2023, we released a set of Responsible AI Principles 
to guide our enterprise-wide efforts to leverage 
new AI technologies in ways that positively impact 
our stakeholders and establish Verizon as a trusted 
brand and partner with respect to AI. 

The ways in which we care for our customers, 
communities, environment and employees define 
our company. I hope you share my excitement 
about the progress we made last year and the many 
opportunities ahead to deliver meaningful value to all 
our stakeholders for years to come. 

Hans Vestberg 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 

“The ways in which we care for 
our customers, communities, 
environment and employees 
define our company. ”

ApproachV TeamersOperational integrityEnvironmentCommunityAppendixVerizon 2023 ESG ReportFour pillars of ESG 

Our ESG strategy is built upon four pillars: governance, integration, 
engagement and reporting. Each of these pillars dynamically supports 
the others, providing us with a foundation for informed decision-
making, transparent communication and effective governance over and 
accountability for Verizon’s most impactful ESG risks and opportunities. 

Governance 

Integration 

We deliver on our corporate purpose and our firm 
commitment to accountability through robust Board 
oversight and management governance structures. 

We leverage dedicated expertise as well as generally 
accepted ESG frameworks to build governance structures 
that inform business decision-making, embedding ESG 
considerations into the DNA of our company. 

Reporting 

Engagement 

We publish decision-useful information for investors and 
other stakeholders, leveraging insights from our integration 
and engagement efforts. 

We aim to build trust through transparency. We engage with 
a broad range of external stakeholders to obtain a holistic 
view of our ESG impacts and strategy.

ESG governance
 

We implement effective governance over and accountability for our key ESG issues through Board and management oversight, stakeholder engagement and transparent reporting. 

Board oversight 

ESG strategy and risk oversight 

Board-level ESG oversight
 

Our Board of Directors oversees Verizon’s ESG risks and opportunities 
with the assistance of four standing committees composed solely 
of independent Directors. An independent Lead Director shares 
governance responsibilities with the Chairman and CEO and 
facilitates forthright communication and independent oversight of 
management’s performance. 

We are committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. 
See how our policies and practices align with the Investor Stewardship 
Group’s corporate governance principles for U.S. listed companies here. 

Board diversity 

Good governance starts with independent and engaged directors who 
respect differing viewpoints. In its ongoing refreshment process, our 
Board seeks a diverse group of candidates who possess the requisite 
judgment, background, skill, expertise and time, as well as diversity with 
respect to race, ethnicity and gender, to strengthen and increase the 
overall diversity, breadth of skills and qualifications of the Board. As of 
December 31, 2023, our 12-member Board included four women and five 
Directors who self-identify as racially or ethnically diverse. 

Each Verizon Director brings to the boardroom skills or experience in 
one or more of our priority ESG issues. While the Corporate Governance 
and Policy Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing our ESG 
strategy, commitments, stakeholder engagement and reporting, the 
full Board regularly addresses ESG issues during business operations 
reviews and strategy discussions. Each Board committee oversees the 
ESG risks and opportunities that fall under that committee’s purview, 
with each committee chair regularly updating our full Board on its ESG-
related activities. ESG topics frequently included on committee agendas 
or addressed during management updates are listed in the table to 
the right. 

For more information on how our Board and committees oversee ESG 
risks and opportunities, see the “Oversight of ESG strategy and risks” 
section in our 2024 Proxy Statement.

To gain a holistic perspective and appropriately assess risks and 
opportunities when making important decisions for the business, we 
have established a number of cross-functional management councils 
composed of members of our executive leadership team. These councils 
meet regularly to address a wide range of matters that are critical to 
our company’s success, including business and technology strategies, 
network and product development, customer experience and brand 
management, capital and expense allocation, emergency preparedness 
and responsible business initiatives. The Strategic Leadership and 
Responsible Business councils are instrumental to the integration of 
sustainability considerations into our overall strategy and business 
operations, overseeing the establishment and execution of our climate-
related and social impact goals. 

Our management councils operate using a year-round planning and 
execution process. This process unites strategy development, financial 
planning and budgeting, talent management and execution to make sure 
that each organization is coordinated as it implements Verizon’s strategy. 
Each organization tracks key performance measures in the execution 
of individual initiatives. These are compiled into one corporate-wide 
scorecard that includes key performance measures for our operational 
net zero goal, employee engagement and DEI initiatives. 

We also have cross-functional management committees, supported 
by dedicated teams of experts, which oversee our implementation of 
policies and programs governing accessibility, artificial intelligence (AI), 
business continuity, climate, cybersecurity, DEI, global supply chain 
management and privacy. 

We proactively engage with our investors, customers and other 
key stakeholders on Verizon’s ESG activities and priorities. These 
engagements may include participation, when requested and 
appropriate, from our independent Lead Director, the chair of the Audit 
Committee or other Directors. We believe that these transparent and 
collaborative exchanges strengthen corporate accountability, improve 
decision-making and ultimately create long-term value. We regularly 
share what we learn with our Board and senior management. In 2023, 
the topics most frequently addressed during these engagements 
included scope 3 emissions, human capital management, data privacy 
and cybersecurity. 

We also seek to develop meaningful partnerships with external 
stakeholders to help ensure that Verizon’s policy positions are informed 
by the communities we serve. Our Consumer Advisory Board (CAB), 
a diverse group of stakeholders that advises Verizon on a variety of 
consumer and policy issues, continued to meet throughout 2023. CAB 
members serve as an informal focus group to test out new policies, 
practices and products and offer fresh thinking and key consumer 
insights on discrete business projects, pilots and case studies. 

Reporting 

Our ESG reporting is aligned with leading sustainability disclosure 
frameworks and informed by emerging ESG-related laws and 
regulations, our stakeholder engagement and the results of our ESG 
prioritization assessment. Our ESG reporting and policies, as well as a 
downloadable ESG data table, can be found on our ESG Resources Hub. 

ESG Center of Excellence 

Our ESG Center of Excellence, composed of teams from Enterprise 
Risk Management, Legal and Accounting Policy, is implementing an 
expanded internal control framework for ESG information to facilitate 
our compliance with ESG-related laws and regulations.

ESG prioritization assessment
 

We have been conducting periodic third-party assessments over the past 10 years to identify the ESG issues that are the most relevant and impactful to our business and our four key stakeholders—our shareholders, 
customers, employees and society. We use the results of these assessments to guide our ESG strategy, focus our reporting and stakeholder engagement and prioritize our ESG integration efforts.

Assessment results 

In 2023, we partnered with a third-party consultant to refresh our 
prioritization assessment. Our latest assessment was conducted 
with the understanding that operational integrity—namely our robust 
business ethics, governance and human rights policies and programs— 
is foundational to our ESG management strategy. We have categorized 
our assessment results into high-priority, priority and emerging issues, 
all of which we actively manage. Our high-priority issues align with our 
mission to create the networks that move the world forward. In light 
of the current geopolitical environment, our stakeholders identified 
regulatory engagement and supply chain management as higher 
priority issues as compared to our 2021 assessment. Human capital 
management, including employee health and safety, labor practices 
and talent attraction and retention, remains a priority issue. Minimizing 
negative environmental impacts and creating digital opportunities 
for our communities also continue to be priority issues for us. Given 
the increased public attention on the development and use of AI, our 
stakeholders identified responsible AI as a newly emerging ESG issue 
for Verizon.

Delivering on Verizon’s corporate purpose to create the networks that move the world forward takes more than the best technology; it takes the best people. 

Strategic recruitment 

Military 

Human capital strategy 

Verizon’s global network of over 106,000 employees is one of 
our most valuable investments. Our human capital strategy to 
build a workforce with the skills, potential and motivation to give 
the company a competitive edge now and into the future rests 
on three pillars: 

•	  Attract and maintain a diverse workforce with the necessary

skills and talent to execute on our business priorities

•	  Develop our employees’ potential by offering educational

opportunities that keep pace with changes happening across
our industry

•	  Inspire our employees by providing meaningful work and

opportunities for career advancement in a collaborative and
inclusive environment

Verizon’s Board of Directors and its Human Resources 
Committee oversee our human capital strategy to attract and 
develop talent, inspire employee engagement and create a 
diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace culture. 

Our approach to recruitment is grounded in our talent plan, which 
defines the talent we need across the business to support how and 
where we want to grow. This extends to recruiting a diverse workforce 
through multiple channels, including robust strategies for campus and 
military hiring and nontraditional talent pipelines. We review our job 
postings to make sure they leverage inclusive language and do not 
impose degree or certification requirements where they are not needed 
for the particular role. We conduct a consistent hiring process that 
considers all qualified candidates in a fair and equitable manner. 

Campus 

Through university partnerships, our campus program identifies 
emerging talent with critical skills aligned with Verizon’s talent plan. We 
maintain competitive and robust internship and co-op skill accelerator 
programs that provide real-world experiences to students and serve as 
pipelines for potential new talent. Further, we are building partnerships 
with high school, college and professional organizations, such as the 
National Academy Foundation, to enhance the diversity of our pipelines. 
We engage year-round with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, 
Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Asian American and Native American 
Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions through executive sponsorship and 
brand ambassador programs. 

We have a dedicated military recruitment team to connect veterans, 
transitioning service members and military spouses with employment 
opportunities at Verizon. Our Skillbridge and Hiring our Heroes 
Fellowship programs provide opportunities for transitioning service 
members to gain critical skills in areas such as cybersecurity, field 
operations and supply chain management. 

Diverse talent 

Verizon partners with many diversity-focused organizations to build 
our employer brand and recruit diverse talent, including AfroTech; 
Society of Women Engineers; National Society of Black Engineers; 
Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers; Hispanic Alliance for Career 
Enhancement; Women in Cybersecurity; the Asian American Foundation 
and Human Rights Campaign. We post open positions on diversity-
focused third-party platforms, such as GI Jobs, Girls in Tech, AARP and 
HBCUConnect, in addition to traditional job sites. We also recruit from 
Verizon’s paid Thrive Apprenticeship program, which gives participants 
with diverse backgrounds and experiences the opportunity to develop 
professional and technical skills.

eligible for up to 80 hours of backup child care or elder care, either in-
center or at-home, as well as a number of discounts on child care services. 
Employees also have access to special needs educational support, 
college coaching and up to 50 hours per year of tutoring support. 

Compensation 

Verizon’s comprehensive total rewards program includes competitive 
base pay, incentive pay and a robust 401(k) savings plan that matches 
6% of eligible contributions. Beginning in 2024, the match is also 
available to employees who make payments toward their qualified 
student loans. Our global broad-based equity award program, Stock 
Together, provides a discretionary award of Verizon restricted stock units 
to our U.S. employees, including union-represented employees, and a 
discretionary cash bonus opportunity that tracks the value of Verizon 
stock units to our international employees. We pay overtime and wage 
premiums as required by law and in some additional instances. We are 
a member of The Worker Financial Wellness Initiative and recognize the 
importance of helping our employees build financial literacy and resiliency. 

When a reduction in force is deemed necessary, we provide separation 
benefits to eligible employees to ease their career transitions, including 
pay replacement based on the role and length of service with the 
company, the continuation of medical, dental and vision insurance under 
COBRA for the duration of the applicable severance period and out­
placement services to assist with finding a new job.

Military leave. When employees, including union-represented 
employees, are called up to active duty, our military leave program helps 
to bridge the gap between military pay and Verizon pay. 

Family leave. Verizon offers eligible employees up to eight weeks of 
parental leave, paid at 100% of base pay, to bond with a newborn or 
adopted (new to family) child, with eligibility beginning on their first 
day of employment. Between short-term disability and parental leave, 
mothers who give birth are eligible for up to 16 weeks of paid maternity 
leave with the preservation of benefits and the flexibility to take 
additional, unpaid time off. 

Unpaid leave. We also offer an unpaid leave program for up to 12 
months, which includes six months of benefits protection. 

Family-friendly benefits 

Verizon employees receive an up to $15,000 per child adoption 
assistance benefit that also applies to surrogacy and guardianship. 
We offer fertility benefits through our medical insurance plans for 
employees, including union-represented employees, with a $75,000 
lifetime maximum to ensure coverage of multiple cycles. Verizon 
offers a healthy pregnancy program through our medical third-party 
administrators for pre- and postpartum support and uses a third party to 
ship breast milk for business travel. 

We offer a dependent care spending account so employees can use 
pre-tax dollars to pay for qualified child care expenses. Employees are 

Health and wellness 

Verizon provides high-quality comprehensive medical, dental, vision, life 
insurance and disability coverage to all of our U.S.-based employees. 
Our benefit plans cover same-gender and opposite-gender domestic 
partners. While the Affordable Care Act requires medical coverage for 
child dependents through age 26, Verizon also offers dental, vision and 
supplemental life insurance. When covered medical services are not 
available within a reasonable geographic distance from an employee’s 
home, our plans provide for the reimbursement of certain expenses related 
to travel to obtain the covered service. In 2023, Verizon invested $2.6 
billion to provide healthcare benefits and services to over 450,000 
employees, eligible retirees and their dependents. 

Core to Verizon’s commitment to well-being is making sure our 
employees have the resources and support to care for their mental 
health. Our new partnership with Spring Health connects employees 
to a continuum of free care through confidential and easily accessible 
services, such as live therapy and on-demand digital wellness exercises. 
The platform is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to all U.S. 
employees. Employees can leverage six free therapy and six free 
coaching sessions per year, either virtually or in-person, before receiving 
referral assistance to other behavioral health services. 

Other free wellness resources available to U.S. employees include on-
site flu shots and health indicator screenings, as well as online resources 
for wellness goals such as tobacco cessation, increased physical activity 
and improved nutrition and sleep.

Open, welcome and safe work environment
 

We have adopted and enforce policies to provide a workplace culture where all V Teamers feel welcomed and safe. 

Non-discrimination policy 

Safety culture 

Partner safety 

Verizon’s policy is to provide equal employment opportunity to all 
persons. Verizon is committed to a workplace free from unlawful 
discrimination and harassment and does not tolerate discriminatory 
or harassing behavior of any kind. Our zero-tolerance policy applies to 
any conduct that has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, 
hostile or offensive work environment. Our non-discrimination and 
anti-harassment commitment is reinforced through a variety of 
employee training programs, including our annual all-employee Code 
of Conduct training and training for new hires and new people leaders. 
Any employee who believes they have been the subject of, or is aware 
of, discrimination, harassment or retaliation can report this to their 
supervisor, local human resources department or Verizon Ethics at 
ethics@verizon.com or verizonethics.com. Complaints are handled in 
a confidential manner, and information is shared only on a need-to­
know basis. All complaints are investigated, and misconduct, including 
any acts of discrimination, harassment or retaliation, is addressed 
with appropriate corrective action, up to and including termination of 
employment. In addition, Verizon prohibits any form of retaliation against 
employees who file these types of complaints, and committing an act 
of retaliation alone can be cause for appropriate corrective action, 
including termination of employment. Verizon Ethics is available 24 hours 
a day, seven days a week, and can accommodate calls in numerous 
languages and anonymous reports. 

We are dedicated to maintaining a safe workplace. We regularly update 
our health and safety standards, programs and training materials to 
educate employees about best practices and working safely. Safety 
training for employees who work in the field includes working at heights, 
driving defensively, establishing work zone protection and safeguarding 
against electricity. General workplace safety topics include ergonomics 
and slip, trip and fall hazards. 

Verizon’s culture of safety begins with our be SAFE (Smart, Aware, 
Focused and Equipped) values. These values emphasize keeping V 
Teamers safe at work, at home and on the road. Our Lifesaving Principles 
address activities with the highest safety risks to prevent serious 
incidents and fatalities and remind employees to take personal 
responsibility for their safety and the safety of those around them. 
Employees conduct pre-job hazard surveys to identify and mitigate 
potential hazards before proceeding. 

In 2023, our occupational injuries and illnesses rate was 1.1 per 
100 employees, well below the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
telecommunications industry average of 1.9. 

Verizon’s policy to maintain a safe workplace and environmentally 
responsible work practices extends to the suppliers that perform 
services and supply products to us. Our Supplier Code of Conduct 
contains safety-specific requirements including compliance with 
applicable laws, regulations and industry codes; adherence to Verizon’s 
Environmental, Health and Safety Policy and the adoption of procedures 
and systems to prevent incidents and track and implement corrective 
actions for safety violations. 

Verizon maintains an incident reporting portal where suppliers and 
their subcontractors are required to report any incidents, injuries, 
environmental releases, property damage, regulatory inspections, 
near misses and hazards working on Verizon projects or premises. 
The environment, health and safety performance of each supplier is 
monitored to ensure that corrective actions are implemented. 

We engage Avetta, a third-party assessment firm, to screen our 
suppliers’ safety and environmental performance. Avetta reviews 
the suppliers’ environmental, health and safety program documents 
and metrics and compares them against industry benchmarks and 
Verizon standards.

Upskilling and reskilling
 

Creating tomorrow’s networks doesn’t happen with yesterday’s skills. V Teamers at all stages of their careers have access to world-class resources to maximize their potential and remain competitive. 

We support the V Team’s professional growth through continuous skill-
building and development that keeps pace with the dynamic changes 
happening across our business. We measure the effectiveness of 
learning solutions through participant evaluations, skill ratings and 
performance changes. 

Promoting a culture of continuous 
learning 

Learning Portal 

Embracing a learning mindset is a core part of our culture. All full- and 
part-time employees have access to curated development opportunities 
on Verizon’s Learning Portal, which includes content from Degreed, 
LinkedIn Learning and Udemy. The portal provides a platform for the 
creation of custom learning pathways to build technical and leadership 
skills, understand business functions and pursue personal development. 
In 2023, the portal provided upskilling content aligned with the top skills 
needed for nearly every role at Verizon. Upskilling content is available in 
a self-serve format, allowing employees to learn at their own pace. 

Verizon conducts formal mid-year and year-end performance reviews 
for all full- and part-time management employees. As part of the annual 
review process, managers have the option of developing individual 
training plans through the Learning Portal. 

Technical upskilling 

Tuition assistance 

We upskill employees across the enterprise to keep pace with our 
evolving business transformation. We provide extensive training across 
sales and customer service, as well as emerging technical areas, such as 
data science, 5G technology and AI. Our 5G Resource Center provides 
an additional array of resources to help V Teamers gain the knowledge 
they need to succeed. 

Verizon employees are provided with up to $8,000 annually through our 
Global Tuition Assistance Program to fund higher education studies from 
a wide range of accredited schools. Employees can access education 
advising services at no charge for guidance on school selection and 
undergraduate degree programs. In 2023, over 4,700 employees took 
advantage of our tuition assistance program. Verizon invested over 
$20 million in this program in 2023. 

Supporting career growth and 
development 

Leadership training 

We invest in a range of formal and informal development opportunities 
to strengthen the leadership capabilities of the V Team. As employees 
grow in their careers and take on new leadership roles, we support 
their success through a robust leadership development portfolio, 
including targeted curricula for new people leaders, mid-level leaders 
and executives. Leadership training is available to all full- and part-time 
employees. 

Get Certified 

Verizon’s Get Certified program provides access to industry-leading 
certification preparation courses, guidance and funding to support the V 
Team’s professional development. 

Talent GPS 

Our Talent GPS initiative supports overall career growth and 
development at Verizon. All employees and people leaders have access 
to a transparent job library that includes insights into the types of roles 
available across all job families and departments, as well as top skills 
and key competencies for each role. Talent GPS also includes a suite of 
resources for employees and managers to support individual career and 
team development planning. 

Learning and development investment 

In 2023, we invested $173.8 million in learning and development 
initiatives for our employees.

Diversity, equity and inclusion
 

We believe that Verizon is a stronger and more competitive company when we recognize and champion each person’s unique strengths and talents. We are committed to sustaining a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) 
within our company and our communities. 

Global DEI strategy 

Verizon’s approach to DEI is based on an integrated, shared 
responsibility framework. Our dedicated DEI team oversees 
a global strategy to align DEI to business goals, drive 
accountability and implement programs and practices to 
promote an inclusive culture. As stated in our Credo and Code 
of Conduct, the entire V Team is expected to contribute to an 
open and respectful workplace. 

Our DEI strategy focuses on four key areas where we can make 
the greatest impact: 

•  Workforce. Attract, develop and inspire diverse talent 

•  Culture. Foster an inclusive and engaging culture that creates 

a best-in-class customer experience 

•  Capability. Accelerate DEI as an organizational capability to 

create a competitive advantage 

•  Society. Make a meaningful global and societal impact that 

further promotes and differentiates our brand 

Pay equity 

In 2023, across all of Verizon, we had 100% pay equity in salary for 
women and men. In the U.S., we also had 100% pay equity in salary with 
respect to race/ethnicity. Consistent with our Commitment to Pay Equity, 
we remain committed to: 

•	  Identifying and promoting best practices in compensation, hiring, 

promotion and career development 

•	  Making hiring, promotion and compensation decisions that promote 

pay equity 

In support of this commitment, Verizon has removed from our employment 
applications all questions seeking current or past salary information. 

DEI incentive compensation measure 

Verizon has a longstanding practice of including a performance measure 
related to workforce diversity in our short-term incentive plan. Our 
current plan incorporates a dedicated ESG component that includes 
measures related to workforce and supplier diversity. 

Promoting inclusion 

Employee resource groups 

We support 10 global employee resource groups (ERGs) that promote 
inclusion throughout Verizon by elevating diverse voices, fostering 
professional development and raising cultural awareness. Our ERGs are 
employee-led and company-funded. To ensure support for our ERGs 
at the highest level, each ERG is matched with a C-suite leader who 
serves as an advocate for the group both internally and externally. The 
executive champions support their ERGs, promoting the group’s mission, 
mentoring its leaders and driving engagement within the company and 
with our customers and communities. We regularly highlight our ERGs 
and their impact on Verizon and our communities through company 
webcasts and service excellence awards. 

Disability inclusion 

Consistent with our corporate policy statement on accessibility and 
disability inclusion, Verizon strives to advance disability inclusion in every 
aspect of our business. Under the guidance of our cross-functional 
Accessibility Leadership team, our accessibility program fosters a 
culture where all employees are empowered and equipped to thrive. In 
addition to hosting our annual Accessibility Summit, Verizon celebrates 
Global Accessibility Awareness Day and Disability Pride Month. Our 
Disability Advisory Board, an external board of trusted leaders from 
disability organizations, met with senior Verizon leaders throughout 
2023 to support our accessibility journey by providing expert advice on 
key strategic relationships and initiatives.

LGBTQ+ inclusion 

Verizon continues to celebrate our LGBTQ+ community. Our LGBTQ+ 
ERG, Prism, is one of our longest-standing groups and continues to 
develop programming and trainings that drive inclusivity and support 
LGBTQ+ employee leadership development. In 2023, Prism sponsored 
a series of deep dives into health and wellness benefits of particular 
relevance to the LGBTQ+ community, including family planning, mental 
health and gender-affirming care. In partnership with the DEI team, Prism 
leads enterprise-wide activities that expand awareness around Global 
Pride Month, International Trans Day of Visibility, Ally Week and World 
AIDS Day. 

Supporting our veterans 

We are a Chairman’s Circle Member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
Foundation’s Veteran Employment and Military Spouse Employment 
Advisory Councils and a sponsor of the Hiring Our Heroes Corporate 
Fellowship program. Through member spotlights, awareness campaigns 
and ongoing events, VALOR, our veteran-focused ERG, drives veteran 
recognition throughout the enterprise. 

Embracing identity 

In 2023, Verizon expanded voluntary options for employees to self-
identify race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity and pronouns 
in order to better understand our workforce representation and to 
continue to grow meaningful programs and services for the V Team. 

Capability building 

Learning pathways 

We offer learning pathways that cement our workplace as one that 
values diversity, equity and inclusion. DEI learning plans on topics such 
as unconscious bias and allyship are made available to all employees. 
We also include DEI content in many leadership development programs. 

Programs and partnerships 

We continue to invest in growth opportunities, including the examples 
below, for the V Team and members of our communities. 

•	  WOW Connect, an expansion of our previous Women of the World 
program, offers opportunities for personal and professional skill 
building and community connection through interactive virtual 
workshops and on-demand resources. 

•	  Break Through Tech offers curriculum, career advising and community 
building with a mission to increase the number of women graduating 
with degrees in computer science and related tech disciplines. 
Verizon partners on a number of initiatives, including the Sprinternship 
program, which facilitates paid internships for first and second year 
college students during their winter breaks. 

•	  Adfellows, a nine-month paid fellowship designed to promote diversity 
in the marketing industry, provides participants with the opportunity 
to gain both company and agency experience. In 2023, 24 Adfellows 
graduated from the program, and 96% of the cohort obtained full-time 
roles in marketing or advertising after graduation. Since 2017, 158 
Adfellows have graduated from the program. 

Continuing the work 

We have made significant investments over many years in workforce 
diversity, a workplace culture of belonging and community outreach. To 
guide our strategy, we engaged a respected third party to undertake an 
audit of our DEI practices both internally within Verizon and externally in 
the communities we serve. The process was overseen by our Board of 
Directors and informed by input from employees responsible for leading 
Verizon’s DEI efforts, representatives from our ERGs and leaders from 
the civil and human rights communities. In 2023, we released the results 
of the audit. 

We remain steadfast in our commitment to fostering a culture of 
diversity, equity and inclusion both within Verizon and in the communities 
we serve. We are continuing to integrate the learnings from this audit 
into our ongoing DEI efforts.

Verizon 2023 ESG ReportApproachV TeamersOperational integrityEnvironmentCommunityAppendixEmployee engagement
 

Our employees are at the center of our success. To drive business performance, we regularly solicit their feedback across a range of workplace topics. 

Annual employee survey process 

Verizon partners with Gallup, an industry leader in workplace analytics 
and insights, to conduct surveys that capture global employee sentiment 
and track progress around our engagement goals. We strongly 
encourage all of our employees to participate in these regular surveys, 
which solicit feedback on a range of issues relating to workplace culture 
and business strategies. Our Chief Human Resources Officer shares the 
top-line results of employee surveys at least annually with our Board of 
Directors and more frequently with senior leadership and all employees.

Q3 survey

action plans. 

VZPulse+ survey 

VZPulse+, our signature and most robust survey of the year, focuses 
on employee engagement using the Gallup Q12 index. This survey is 
designed to measure sentiment on performance management, leadership, 
inclusion, values and empowerment. Confidential, aggregated results of 
the VZPulse+ survey are cascaded, as applicable, to leaders throughout 
the company and jumpstart an annual action-planning process. Leaders 
are expected to share their team-specific results and create a customized 
action plan to be implemented over the next 12 months. Subsequent 
surveys measure the implementation and efficacy of the plans. 

The 2023 VZPulse+ survey achieved an employee participation rate 
of 88%. Our results ranked in the 83rd percentile in overall employee 
engagement, 82nd percentile for a culture of inclusion and 76th 
percentile in overall satisfaction compared to Gallup’s company-wide 
database. Our results indicate that, compared to other organizations, 
Verizon’s culture is more caring, providing employees with frequent 
recognition and regular progress discussions. 

Other engagement channels 

In addition to our Gallup surveys, Verizon conducts employee life cycle 
surveys, including onboarding, learning and development and exit 
surveys, to assess the effectiveness of our programs and policies. The 
results of these surveys are shared with the program owners. 

Our senior leaders engage with and solicit feedback from our employees 
during periodic town halls and leadership forums. Our CEO and senior 
leaders regularly join company webcasts, including after each quarterly 
earnings release, to discuss developments across our business and 
topical societal issues and answer employee questions. 

Verizon 2023 ESG ReportApproachV TeamersOperational integrityEnvironmentCommunityAppendix 
 
 
 
Labor relations 


Verizon’s workforce includes a large presence of union-represented employees. The Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) together represent approximately 
24% of our employees as of December 31, 2023. 

Informed by the International Labour Organization Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, as well as the United 
Nations Global Compact, Verizon respects our employees’ rights to 
freedom of association and collective bargaining in compliance with 
applicable law, including the right to join or not join worker organizations 
(labor unions). We respect our employees’ rights to engage in 
concerted, protected activity. When our employees elect to be union-
represented, Verizon engages in constructive labor relations with 
the union representing the employees and participates in good-faith 
bargaining. The current collective bargaining agreements that cover 
our union-represented employees who serve customers in our Mid-
Atlantic and Northeast service areas extend through August 1, 2026. In 
addition, where applicable outside of the U.S., we engage with employee 
representative bodies such as works councils. 

We have a long history of maintaining open dialogues with national and 
local leaders of the CWA and IBEW, as well as works council leaders 
outside the U.S., on key business topics such as worker safety, customer 
service, plans to improve operational processes and our business 
performance and the impacts of changing technology and competition 
on our customers, employees and business strategy. 

We encourage our employees to refresh and build their skills on an 
ongoing basis. Verizon employees can take advantage of our Global 
Tuition Assistance Program, through which they receive a capped 
reimbursement for covered expenses to continue their education 
at any level. All employees have access to our complete catalog of 
learning courses. 

We invest in ongoing educational opportunities for our workers. Training 
occurs across a variety of in-person and online platforms and through 
virtual and simulated environments. Newly hired employees launch 
their Verizon careers through intensive orientation sessions, on-the-job 
shadowing and, where applicable, technical training and skill application 
days. We help keep our workers and, ultimately, our customers safe by 
weaving safety components, including required courses and certification 
programs, into every technical training curriculum. 

We regularly instruct our local managers and supervisors to 
appropriately engage with employees and abide by all applicable federal, 
state and local laws. We also train them on our open-door policy for 
employees to raise issues or concerns, as well as the appropriate 
processes to respect and redress such issues. Verizon maintains several 
avenues through which all employees, including union-represented 
workers, may raise concerns, including through our global ethics hotline 
and online web portal discussed in Business ethics.

Verizon 2023 ESG ReportApproachV TeamersOperational integrityEnvironmentCommunityAppendixBusiness ethics 

We are committed to operating responsibly and with integrity. We have adopted enterprise-wide policies to reinforce ethical business conduct and provide mechanisms for accountability. 

Guiding principles 

Credo 

Grounded in our core values of integrity, respect, performance excellence, personal accountability and social responsibility, our Credo guides 
our actions and empowers our decision-making while inspiring us to drive inclusive growth. 

Code of Conduct 

Our Code of Conduct is a powerful tool that helps employees put our core values into action. It provides employees with clear standards, 
helpful examples and information on where to go for guidance about ethical decision-making or to raise compliance concerns—including the 
Verizon Ethics hotline that allows for anonymous reporting or “whistleblowing.” 

All Verizon employees receive mandatory training on our Code of Conduct at their time of hire, and its provisions are continually reinforced 
through annual training and periodic communications. The Code and training are available to employees in 11 languages. 

The current version of the Code, like every prior iteration, features extensive coverage of anti-corruption issues, including Verizon’s absolute 
prohibition on bribery, our policy requirement to obtain legal approval before providing anything of value to any government official, the need 
for adequate controls over third parties who may interact with government officials on our behalf and the importance of maintaining records 
that fully and accurately document all business transactions. 

28 

Enterprise-wide compliance program
 

Verizon’s enterprise-wide compliance program is overseen by the 
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and managed by our Chief 
Compliance Officer. We design our compliance program to promote a 
culture of integrity and accountability throughout Verizon, including its 
subsidiaries, by: 

•	  Establishing standards of conduct, including the Code of Conduct, 

corporate policy statements and other guidelines 

•	  Educating employees on ethical decision-making, legal obligations and 

compliance risks through training and communications 

•	  Assessing legal and ethical risks and providing insights regarding 

those risks to business leaders 

•	  Providing subject matter expertise and advice regarding specific 

risk areas 

•	  Providing employees and third parties with mechanisms to seek 
guidance, raise concerns and report allegations of misconduct 

•	  Investigating instances of potential misconduct 

•	  Ensuring appropriate corrective action for substantiated cases 

of misconduct 

•	  Providing regular reports to the Audit Committee of the Board 

of Directors 

Verizon conducts regular compliance risk assessments and audits. 
These assessments are led by our Chief Compliance Officer, who 
reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Annual 
compliance executive risk assessments of business units and corporate 
functions are designed to identify and assess existing, evolving and 
emerging risk areas and develop appropriate risk mitigation plans. The 
Chief Compliance Officer also oversees periodic risk assessments of 
specific compliance risk areas, such as anti-corruption. 

Verizon 2023 ESG ReportApproachV TeamersOperational integrityEnvironmentCommunityAppendix 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Third-party risk is assessed by the Third Party Risk Management 
Program, which maintains a formal process to analyze risk and 
appropriately mitigate concerns involving suppliers and partners. 
Additionally, Verizon Internal Audit, an independent function that also 
reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board, conducts a wide 
range of audits each year, including audits focused specifically on 
Verizon’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 

Ethics team 

Verizon’s integrated ethics and compliance organization delivers 
consistent guidance on integrity issues, so that as we create the 
networks that move the world forward, we do it the right way. Verizon 
Ethics serves as the primary resource for employees seeking ethics 
guidance and has two primary functions: fielding questions about ethics 
issues and responding to concerns and complaints about potential 
misconduct. The team: 

• Provides a confidential online portal and a 24/7 global ethics hotline 
that can accommodate calls in numerous languages for anyone who 
wants to seek guidance or report ethics concerns 

• Triages concerns and allegations raised and, when appropriate, makes 

sure that they are assigned to the correct teams in the Finance, 
Human Resources, Legal and Security organizations 

• Provides ethics advice to employees seeking guidance in applying 

the Code of Conduct and company policies to business decisions or 
outside interests 

• Manages the International Ethics Advisors network, which acts 

as a force multiplier to provide local, in-country ethics support to 
employees outside the U.S. 

• Administers the annual conflict of interest questionnaire 

Verizon thoroughly investigates all claims of misconduct. Teams within 
the Human Resources, Legal and Security organizations are specially 
trained to probe potential violations of the Code and provide updates 
and case resolutions, as appropriate, to reporters of ethics concerns. 
Our Internal Audit and Enterprise Risk Management teams provide 
additional support with investigations as needed. Verizon consistently 
reinforces to all employees that retaliation against anyone submitting 
complaints or cooperating with an investigation is strictly prohibited, and 
anyone engaging in retaliation is subject to discipline, up to and including 
termination of employment. This prohibition is reiterated in training, 
communications and during investigatory interviews. We also ensure 
transparency in investigations by having our Chief Compliance Officer 
regularly report serious Code violations to the Audit Committee of the 
Board of Directors. 

Anti-corruption 

Verizon’s anti-corruption program is designed in accordance with the U.S. 
Department of Justice’s corporate compliance program guidance. We 
enforce a zero-tolerance policy for bribery or corruption of any kind and 
maintain strong anti-corruption standards designed to prevent, detect 
and remedy such risks. All employees receive general anti-corruption 
training as part of their annual Code of Conduct training. In addition, 
employees in relevant operational roles receive targeted anti-corruption 
training and communications that clearly articulate our expectations, 
core principles and zero tolerance for any corrupt practices. Our training 
helps employees understand and comply with various anti-bribery laws, 
including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. 
We require employees to obtain legal approval before giving anything of 
value to a public official, including requests by government officials for 
Verizon to make “expediting” or “facilitating” payments. We have internal 
controls in place, such as the monitoring of travel, gifts and expenses, to 
help deter and detect high-risk transactions. 

Every two years, we formally review and assess our anti-corruption 
program in order to identify areas for improvement. Our Chief 
Compliance Officer reports the findings to the Audit Committee of the 
Board of Directors. Risk assessments of individual programs, groups 
and activities within the company are conducted as needed. These 
assessments identify risks, including corruption-related risks, and 
recommend process improvements to address those risks in all areas of 
the business. 

Antitrust compliance 

Verizon consistently promotes a culture of antitrust compliance across 
the enterprise. Our dedicated in-house antitrust team continually 
monitors the business and regulatory environment, assesses risk and 
dynamically refreshes our global antitrust program for maximum reach 
and effectiveness. The antitrust team embeds antitrust flags and 
reporting mechanisms into product development and review processes 
to scale and systematize identification of potential competition issues 
by design. 

We provide global and tailored antitrust trainings. We also require all 
employees at the manager level and above, plus lower-level employees 
in identified higher exposure teams, to take an antitrust foundations 
course at their time of hire. We periodically refresh this training. We make 
the antitrust foundations course, as well as numerous more-in-depth 
courses, available to all Verizon employees on-demand. 

Our Code of Conduct mandates compliance with applicable antitrust 
laws. The antitrust and compliance teams investigate any conduct 
suspected to violate antitrust laws and the Code of Conduct. Employees 
in violation face repercussions ranging from retraining to termination.

Political contributions and engagement 

Third-party organizations 

Global tax policy 

We participate in the policymaking process at the federal, state and 
local levels in order to inform public officials of Verizon’s views on 
policy issues. Government policies can have a significant impact on our 
business, whether they involve decisions on taxes, technology regulation 
or consumer issues like protecting user privacy and stopping illegal 
robocalls. We participate in these conversations so that government 
decision-makers understand how these policies could affect Verizon and 
our customers, employees and shareholders. 

Lobbying 

As part of our advocacy, we engage in lobbying at all levels of 
government through our own employees and through outside 
consultants. Our Public Policy and Government Affairs organization 
approves any engagement of lobbyists on behalf of Verizon, and we 
strictly comply with all lobbying laws requiring disclosure of our activities 
and expenses. 

Political contributions 

Political contributions are one way we support the democratic electoral 
process and participate in the policy dialogue. Verizon makes political 
contributions where law permits and also operates several political 
action committees (PACs) that support candidates at the federal, state 
and local levels. All contributions by Verizon and our PACs are made 
to promote the interests of the company, our shareholders and our 
customers and without regard to the personal political interests of 
Verizon executives. We support candidates of any political party who 
share our key strategic business and policy priorities, even if we do not 
agree with them on every issue. We do not make corporate political 
contributions or PAC contributions to presidential candidates or federal 
SuperPACs. 

Verizon supports trade associations and issue advocacy organizations 
for a number of reasons, including to reflect our interest in the 
community, acquire valuable industry and market expertise and 
support our strategic policy positions, business goals and interests. 
We recognize that we may not always agree with every position of 
each organization or its members and that these groups often have 
a diversity of members, interests and viewpoints that may not always 
reflect Verizon’s views or priorities. In order to mitigate reputational 
risks associated with our engagement with these organizations, we 
regularly review our participation to confirm ongoing alignment with our 
corporate priorities and goals. When we disagree with a position of an 
organization we support, we communicate our concerns through the 
senior executives who interact with these organizations. 

Governance, transparency and disclosure 

Verizon participates in policy dialogues with appropriate governance, 
oversight and transparency mechanisms to mitigate reputational risk. 
Verizon’s political activity is directly overseen by the Legal and Public 
Policy and Government Affairs organizations. All of our political activity is 
subject to robust internal controls set forth in our Code of Conduct and 
other corporate policies. The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee 
of our Board of Directors oversees our participation in the political 
process, including political giving, memberships in trade associations and 
reputational risk, and receives a comprehensive briefing on these activities 
at least annually. 

Verizon understands that transparency regarding our political 
engagement is critical to maintaining the trust of our employees, 
shareholders and the public, so we publish our Political Engagement 
Report twice a year. This report describes our current policy priorities, 
provides information about lobbying activities and our Public Policy and 
Government Affairs organization’s significant memberships in trade 
associations and issue advocacy organizations, and lists all of our 
PAC contributions, corporate political contributions, support for ballot 
initiatives and independent expenditures for the period covered. 

30 

Verizon is a responsible taxpayer that timely and accurately files all 
applicable tax returns, pays all applicable taxes and accurately reports 
taxes in our financial statements. We are committed to maintaining a 
transparent and positive working relationship with tax authorities in the 
jurisdictions in which we operate. We also partner with tax authorities 
and governments to advocate for tax guidance and legislation that 
provides clarity, is administrable, reduces tax disputes and is socially and 
fiscally responsible. 

Verizon has implemented formal tax governance policies, procedures 
and controls that strive to meet or exceed best practices on tax 
governance. Our tax control framework is SOX-compliant and subject to 
periodic review by the Senior Vice President & Deputy General Counsel – 
Corporate Taxes, Verizon Internal Audit and our external auditors. 
Verizon’s tax principles, and compliance with them, are overseen by the 
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, as well as the Chief Financial 
Officer and Chief Legal Officer. 

Verizon’s Global Tax Policy provides that Verizon only engages in 
transactions that are supported by a non-tax business purpose. As such, 
we only operate in jurisdictions based on the needs of the business and 
the requirements of our multinational customers. We do not utilize zero 
or low tax jurisdictions outside the U.S. to minimize our taxes, and we do 
not engage in tax shelter transactions or transactions that have been 
identified as “listed transactions” or “transactions of interest” by the 
U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. In addition, 
Verizon’s transfer pricing policies are based on the arm’s length principle 
and compliance with guidelines and documentation requirements set by 
the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Our approach to human rights
 

Verizon’s Human Rights Statement, grounded in our Credo, sets forth our commitment to respecting internationally recognized human rights. Our approach to human rights governance is guided by the human rights due diligence 
framework set forth in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 

Business & Human Rights Program 

Strategic human rights assessments 

Child rights impact assessment 

Verizon’s dedicated Business & Human Rights Program leads our human 
rights governance efforts. We take a structured approach to integrating 
and embedding human rights considerations into decision-making 
processes across the company. Our efforts include attention to the 
human rights impacts of our products, services, strategy and operations 
and to our engagements with employees, customers, communities, 
governments, business partners and suppliers. The Business & Human 
Rights Program undertakes these efforts with support from a global 
cross-functional team of internal partners and with oversight from the 
Corporate Governance and Policy Committee of our Board of Directors. 

Our Business & Human Rights Program provides Verizon employees 
with tools, guidance and targeted training to support the company’s 
efforts to operate in a manner that is consistent with our commitment 
to respect human rights. A learning module is available to all Verizon 
employees with information on international human rights, our company’s 
efforts to respect human rights and the work of the Business & Human 
Rights Program. 

Our Business & Human Rights Program conducts ongoing human rights 
due diligence to identify, understand and address human rights risks 
that may intersect with our business. Our due diligence efforts include 
strategic human rights impact assessments, when appropriate. These 
strategic human rights assessments are informed by consultation with 
internal teams and external stakeholders from industry, civil society, 
academia and the communities where we do business. 

In 2022, we published findings from Verizon’s first child rights impact 
assessment. The assessment examined Verizon’s potential impacts 
on children across all aspects of our operations, including impacts in 
connection with digital access, inclusion and skills; digital safety; product 
design and our supply chain. 

For more information on our human rights due diligence and 
assessments, see our Human Rights website. 

Corporate-wide saliency assessment 

Our human rights work focuses on our salient issues: the right to 
privacy, the right to be free from discrimination, the right to freedom of 
expression and opinion, rights in the workplace and rights in the supply 
chain. In 2023, we undertook a refresh of our saliency assessment and 
considered both changes to our business and the impacts of external 
trends. The 2023 refresh confirmed and provided new insights on our 
salient issues and the focus areas of our human rights work. 

Human rights impact assessment of 5G and emerging 
technologies 

We conducted a human rights impact assessment focused on our 
impacts and opportunities in a 5G-enabled technology era. This 
assessment examined 5G technology from the perspective of a network 
operator and looked at the roles and responsibilities of different actors 
in respecting human rights in an increasingly interconnected 5G 
technology ecosystem. 

Focus on digital rights 

Our Business & Human Rights Program works closely 
with internal teams to build governance mechanisms and 
provide transparency about Verizon’s approaches to privacy, 
free expression and non-discrimination. For example, our 
newly published approach to AI governance that guides our 
development, acquisition, deployment and use of AI includes a 
principle relating to respect for human rights and responsibility 
to society. For more information, see our Responsible AI 
Program. 

We continue to support our digital rights work through our 
membership in the Global Network Initiative, the leading multi-
stakeholder initiative in the information and communications 
technology sector. 

31 

Verizon 2023 ESG ReportApproachV TeamersOperational integrityEnvironmentCommunityAppendixSupply chain 

Verizon’s supply chain is the foundation of our secure network. Our suppliers range from the world’s largest original equipment manufacturers to smaller providers of equipment, hardware, software and various services. We have 
implemented risk mitigation processes and an active supplier engagement program to build a diverse, resilient and responsible supply chain. 

Supplier diversity 

Supply chain 

Our enterprise-wide supplier diversity initiative aims to build a supply 
chain that is as diverse as the communities we serve. We believe 
that accelerating diverse business development strengthens the 
supplier ecosystem. 

Verizon’s Center of Excellence for Supplier Diversity leads our 
enterprise-wide supplier diversity program, working with a network 
of business unit “supplier champions” from across the company 
to set internal supplier diversity targets, track our diversity spend 
goals and reporting obligations, implement training for employees 
and suppliers and monitor progress through regular analytics and 
reporting. Our Supplier Diversity team also works closely with our 
Sourcing organization to confirm that suppliers from traditionally 
underrepresented, disadvantaged or minority groups are positioned to 
compete for new contracts and opportunities. We are a charter member 
of the Billion Dollar Roundtable, a coalition formed in 2001 of companies 
that each spend more than $1 billion every year with diverse businesses. 

Capital markets 

Legal profession 

Verizon continues to demonstrate leadership in promoting the growth 
of diverse firms in the debt capital markets. Over the past year, we 
partnered with 10 diverse firms across all of our eligible unsecured 
debt capital markets transactions and asset-backed securities (ABS) 
offerings. We also allocated 40.6% of gross unsecured debt capital 
markets fees to diverse firms and awarded 9.6% of ABS underwriting 
fees to diverse firms. Outside of the debt capital markets, we continue 
to support diverse managers in our defined benefit pension plan. Assets 
under management with diverse firms constituted 5.3% of the defined 
benefit pension plan assets as of December 31, 2023. 

Marketing ecosystem 

Verizon’s Responsible Marketing Action Plan seeks to increase 
diversity and equity across the creative supply chain; build an inclusive 
environment for talent that reflects the communities we serve; 
strengthen practices aimed at fighting bias and stereotypes in all 
advertising, content and media and maintain the gold standard of brand 
safety. Our Responsible Marketing Policy prohibits Verizon creative from 
being placed or run in broadcast or digital environments where hateful, 
denigrating, discriminatory or other types of harmful content appear. 
Annually, we aim to spend over 40% of our production budget with 
diverse-owned production companies and engage diverse directors on 
at least 40% of our productions. 

Verizon has a longstanding program to promote DEI in the legal 
profession. We collect and regularly review our outside counsel firms’ 
diversity representation metrics, staffing across Verizon matters and 
other relevant information to evaluate the firms’ DEI efforts and work 
together on opportunities for enhancement, as appropriate. We also 
collaborate with a number of our outside counsel firms on paid internship 
programs that foster DEI in the legal pipeline. 

Diverse supplier spend 

In 2023, Verizon spent $6.1 billion in goods and services directly 
and indirectly with diverse suppliers, including businesses 51% 
owned, operated and controlled by people of color, women, 
veterans, service-disabled veterans, LGBTQ+ and people with 
disabilities.2 Over the past 10 years, we have spent $54.3 billion 
in goods and services with diverse suppliers. 

To further strengthen our efforts, our short-term incentive 
plan for management employees has included a performance 
measure related to supplier diversity for over 15 years. 

32 

Verizon 2023 ESG ReportApproachV TeamersOperational integrityEnvironmentCommunityAppendixSupply chain management 

Business partner standards of conduct 

Supplier assessments 

Suppliers. Verizon expects all of our suppliers to comply with our 
Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier Code) and maintain policies and 
procedures to guard against illegal activity such as corruption, extortion, 
embezzlement and bribery. Our Supplier Code also forbids the use of 
child labor and forced labor, protects employees’ rights to freedom of 
association and collective bargaining, as permitted by local laws, and 
prohibits discrimination on any basis prohibited by applicable law. We 
reserve the right to review or audit our suppliers’ compliance with the 
Supplier Code. 

Sales agents. We recognize that our reputation is affected by the 
actions of the agents authorized to participate in the sale of our services 
and equipment to customers. Our Sales Agent Standards of Conduct 
(Sales Agent Standards) detail the behavior and values that we expect 
our sales agents to uphold. The Sales Agent Standards also require 
our sales agents to implement an appropriate management process 
to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable laws, regulations and 
customer requirements, as well as with the standards. We reserve the 
right to review or audit our sales agents’ compliance with the Sales 
Agent Standards. 

Promoting compliance. Verizon provides mandatory training on 
our Supplier Code and Sales Agent Standards for our key suppliers 
and sales agents. We have established processes for parties to 
promptly report questions or concerns relating to our Supplier Code 
and Sales Agent Standards. Any party can raise questions or concerns 
or report potential or actual violations by contacting Verizon Ethics 
via email or through our confidential portal and hotline, available at 
verizonethics.com. 

We leverage third-party platforms and industry partnerships to embed 
responsible business practices throughout our supply chain. 

EcoVadis 

In addition to submitting our own annual EcoVadis response, we use 
the EcoVadis assessment tool to evaluate our suppliers’ responsible 
performance. We monitor and assess supplier performance in four 
areas: environment, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable 
procurement. Since 2013, we have assessed 728 key suppliers through 
our partnership with EcoVadis. When weaknesses are identified, we 
work with the supplier to create a corrective action plan to improve their 
current activities, benefitting both Verizon and the supplier. 

Joint Alliance for CSR 

Verizon is a member of the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC), an association 
of telecommunications operators that collaboratively audits common 
suppliers and looks for opportunities to improve supplier responsibility 
across our industry. JAC audits are based on a common verification, 
assessment and development methodology, including the generation 
of corrective action plans. Topics covered by these audits include child 
labor, forced labor, worker health and safety, freedom of association, 
non-discrimination, disciplinary practices, working hours, wages and 
compensation, environmental protection and business ethics. Through 
2023, 1,060 supplier audits had been completed since JAC’s inception 
in 2010, with 150 audits completed in 2023. 

Third Party Risk Management Program 

Verizon’s Third Party Risk Management Program supports the company’s 
responsible sourcing efforts. Managed by a dedicated team, the program 
enables Verizon to identify, assess, monitor and manage a range of 
supply chain risks, including those that may be associated with the social 
and environmental impacts of supplier activity. The Third Party Risk 
Management team works closely with teams across the company to 
implement a risk management framework and make recommendations 
regarding future supplier engagement. This work happens throughout 
the supplier life cycle, including during planning, due diligence, 
contracting, ongoing monitoring and termination. The Third Party Risk 
Management team is responsible for providing program oversight, 
coordination and support to stakeholders across Verizon. Supply chain 
risk management is reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of 
Directors as part of business risk reviews held throughout the year. 

Supply Chain Resilience Management Program 

A resilient supply chain is an effective supply chain. Verizon’s Supply 
Chain Resilience Management Program identifies, assesses, monitors 
and manages supply chain risks, including disruptions caused by 
natural and human-induced events, to better coordinate our supply 
chain activities and aid the effectiveness of our controls. The program 
monitors how Verizon employees and business partners manage the life 
cycle phases of our physical products, software, firmware and services. 
The program also assesses whether stakeholders need to improve their 
procedures to more effectively mitigate supply chain risks as they relate 
to four key categories: security, integrity, resilience and quality. This work 
is guided by our corporate policy statement on supply chain resilience 
management and overseen by our cross-functional Global Supply Chain 
Resilience Governance Council.

Responsible procurement 

Conflict minerals 

Verizon is dedicated to responsible sourcing practices that support 
human rights, ethical conduct and environmental protection. We 
collaborate with suppliers and industry partners to strengthen 
responsible sourcing practices around the world. 

Modern slavery and human trafficking 

Verizon is committed to assessing and addressing the risk of modern 
slavery and human trafficking within our business operations and supply 
chain. Our Business & Human Rights Program, Business Risk, Sourcing 
and Third Party Risk Management teams review the nature and extent of 
our exposure to the risk of modern slavery on an ongoing basis, focusing 
on areas of Verizon’s supply chain that may be at higher risk. Our 
efforts are also informed by engagement with industry peers through 
organizations such as JAC. 

Our Business Risk team is trained on modern slavery and human 
trafficking risk and carries out reputational risk due diligence on new and 
existing suppliers. The team escalates any potential risk factors to the 
Third Party Risk Management and appropriate legal teams for review. We 
describe our efforts in more detail in our country-specific human rights 
due diligence statements. 

Verizon’s conflict minerals due diligence framework was designed 
to align with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development’s Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains 
of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. Our approach 
takes into account our position in the conflict minerals supply chain and 
the fact that Verizon does not typically contract to manufacture the 
products associated with our business. We require our suppliers, when 
appropriate, to take steps to verify that their products do not include 
materials that either directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed 
groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or in any adjoining 
country. We also participate in industry initiatives and partnerships to 
support responsible raw material sourcing in high-risk countries and 
regions, including the Responsible Business Alliance and the Public-
Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade. Our Chief Financial 
Officer is the signatory on our Conflict Minerals Report, whenever such 
filing is required.3

Digital responsibility
 

We recognize that we have a responsibility to our customers, employees, business partners and shareholders to guard against the risks that come with operating in an increasingly digital world. 

Cybersecurity 

Verizon’s comprehensive cybersecurity program is designed to identify 
and protect against cybersecurity risks and to position Verizon to rapidly 
detect, respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents that impact 
our company. The program is built on the following pillars: 

•  NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Our program is aligned to the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Cybersecurity 
Framework, which outlines the core components and responsibilities 
necessary to sustain a healthy and well-balanced cybersecurity 
program. 

•  Risk identification. We continually assess the cybersecurity threat 

and vulnerability landscape using various commercial, government and 
publicly available information sources. 

•  Risk detection. We use both manual and automated detection 

methods on a scheduled and ad-hoc basis to identify vulnerabilities 
within, and threats to, our operations and network infrastructure. 

•  Risk evaluation. Once a cybersecurity vulnerability is detected, 

we assign a threat severity classification based on the risk profile 
associated with the vulnerability. 

•  Remediation. Verizon’s information security team reports all 

cybersecurity vulnerabilities and their associated threat classification 
to the appropriate business team for remediation. Deadlines for 
remediation are set based on the severity of the threat and closely 
tracked in a central system of record. In the instances when a 
remediation deadline cannot be met, the information security and 
business teams work together to deploy appropriate mitigating or 
compensating controls until the remediation work is complete. 

35 

•  Metrics and analysis. We track the performance of our cybersecurity 
program by collecting, retaining and analyzing a broad range of data 
related to our threat identification, detection and response activity. We 
use this data to assess threat trends, for strategic planning purposes 
and to enhance management accountability for cybersecurity. 

Verizon has a comprehensive enterprise cybersecurity incident response 
plan, which is activated in the event of a cybersecurity incident. The plan 
is a detailed playbook that specifies how Verizon classifies, responds 
to and recovers from cybersecurity incidents and includes notification 
procedures that vary depending on the significance of the incident. 
When warranted by the severity of the incident, our Chief Executive 
Officer and other senior executives are part of the notification chain. 

Verizon validates enterprise cybersecurity maturity every two years 
through a third-party maturity assessment. This assessment measures 
Verizon’s ability to identify, prevent, detect, respond to and recover from 
threats to systems, assets and data. The results of the assessment 
serve as the baseline for enterprise cybersecurity across the company. 
In addition to this baseline, certain subsets of our technology environment 
are subject to incremental cybersecurity certification and periodic third-
party validation under applicable regulatory or contractual requirements. 

Integrated cybersecurity risk management 

Verizon’s Senior Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer 
(CISO) has responsibility for the management of cybersecurity risks 
at the company. The CISO and her team are responsible for Verizon’s 
information security strategy, policy, standards, architecture and 
processes. 

Verizon effectuates cybersecurity management by providing for close 
cooperation among the CISO’s team and other teams within the 
company, as well as by integrating cybersecurity risk into our overall 
enterprise risk management structures and processes. Each of our 
business units and certain functional groups have a Business Information 
Security Officer, who is an integral member of that unit or group but 
reports to the CISO. This structure provides the CISO with line of sight 
across the enterprise. 

The Verizon Executive Security Council (VESC) oversees and evaluates 
the work of the CISO and her team. The VESC provides oversight of 
all aspects of Verizon’s cybersecurity program and, at regular intervals 
throughout the year, evaluates key cybersecurity metrics as well as 
planned and ongoing initiatives to reduce cybersecurity risks. Verizon’s 
Management Audit Committee (VMAC), which includes our Chief 
Financial Officer, Senior Vice President of Internal Audit and other senior 
executives, is responsible for overseeing components of our overall risk 
management strategy. The VMAC receives quarterly updates from the 
CISO on Verizon’s cybersecurity program. 

Verizon also operates a robust internal audit program. Each year, Verizon’s 
internal audit team conducts an overall business risk assessment, 
which includes an evaluation of cybersecurity risks. The results of the 
assessment are presented to the leaders of the relevant business teams, 
who are responsible for prioritizing and addressing the risks identified.

Board oversight of cybersecurity risk 

Data privacy 

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has primary responsibility 
for overseeing our risk management and compliance programs relating 
to cybersecurity and data privacy. The CISO leads an annual review 
and discussion with the full Board dedicated to Verizon’s cybersecurity 
risks, threats and protections. The CISO provides a mid-year update to 
this annual review to the Audit Committee and, as warranted, additional 
updates throughout the year. The Audit Committee also receives a 
report from senior management on Verizon’s cybersecurity posture and 
related matters at each of its other meetings during the year at which 
the CISO is not present. 

Third-party risk management 

We have implemented processes to identify and manage risks from 
cybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party suppliers. 
Our Third Party Risk Management team establishes governance, 
processes and tools for managing various supplier-related risks, 
including information security. As a condition to working with Verizon, 
suppliers who access sensitive business or customer information are 
expected to meet certain information security requirements. 

Data Breach Investigations Report 

Verizon’s perspective on data security is based, in part, on our annual 
Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), a comprehensive study of 
data security incidents from around the world. In 2023, the DBIR analyzed 
over 16,300 cybersecurity incidents. This actionable intelligence helps 
companies large and small better understand the threat environment and 
plays an important role in shaping Verizon’s own cybersecurity efforts. 

Verizon recognizes that protecting the privacy of customer, employee 
and business partner data is an essential part of operating and growing 
our business. We have established measures to protect the privacy and 
security of the data entrusted to us and to support compliance with 
current and emerging international, federal and state data privacy 
legislation. Our Chief Privacy Officer oversees this work and reviews 
data privacy risks and mitigating actions with the Audit Committee of our 
Board of Directors at least annually. 

Verizon has adopted corporate policies and operating procedures 
governing the use, retention and protection of the data we collect. 
Detailed information about Verizon’s privacy policies and practices 
can be found at our Privacy Center, which contains links to our Privacy 
Policy, supplemental policies for some of our apps and services and 
privacy policies maintained by our affiliated companies. We update 
our privacy policies to reflect developments in products, services and 
technologies. We do not use personal information in a manner that is 
materially different from the terms of the privacy policy that was in place 
at the time that information was collected without providing notice and 
obtaining consent. 

Our policies and procedures are subject to numerous controls. We utilize 
internal audits and employee, contractor and supplier training to promote 
ongoing compliance. Verizon has implemented a privacy governance 
framework to map privacy requirements to specific operational controls, 
which are assigned to appropriate owners. As part of the framework, 
Verizon tests and monitors the controls and develops remediation 
plans where necessary. Key employees include terms related to their 
ownership of controls in their annual performance agreements. 

Verizon continuously monitors for legislative and regulatory 
developments and updates our policies and processes as needed. We 
continue to advocate for a uniform federal privacy framework that would 
apply to all participants in the technology ecosystem. 

Our stewardship of personal information 

We are committed to handling the personal information we collect 
from and about our customers, employees and business partners 
appropriately throughout every phase of the data life cycle, including 
collection, use, disclosure, retention and destruction. We disclose our 
practices and have in place policies related to each phase. We conduct 
privacy reviews when we develop and modify products, systems or other 
initiatives and purchase or sell assets. Our privacy impact assessment 
process discussed on the next page provides a platform for formalized 
review of initiatives that involve the personal information entrusted to us. 
We have also implemented a third-party risk management process that 
identifies, assesses and mitigates risks throughout the life cycle of our 
engagement with suppliers. 

Collection and use. We collect and use personal information as we 
describe in our publicly available privacy policies and in some cases, 
for business customers, in accordance with contractual requirements. 
We seek to minimize the amount of personal information that we collect 
and retain, and we provide customers several ways to review and keep 
their account information up to date. We provide customers with easy­
to-understand privacy choices based on the sensitivity of the personal 
information and how it will be used or disclosed. We have implemented 
specific controls around consumers’ most sensitive data. 

Disclosure. We share personal information within Verizon and with 
suppliers, contractors and partners for a variety of purposes as 
described in our privacy policies. We require suppliers and contractors 
that process personal information to use it only for the purpose for 
which it was provided or otherwise as permitted by law and to put in 
place data security measures that provide the same material protections 
as those we use at Verizon. We enforce these requirements through 
binding contractual provisions that are put in place before personal 
information is shared.

Data retention and destruction. We maintain corporate policies 
governing data retention and destruction and review relevant practices 
as part of our privacy impact assessment process. We retain personally 
identifiable records only as long as reasonably necessary for business, 
accounting, tax or legal purposes. We meet the requirements of our 
enterprise customers by contractually agreeing to custom data retention 
timelines and data destruction practices when needed. 

Our employees are responsible for cooperating with and assisting 
business owners in fulfilling the obligations and requirements of our 
information security policy, as well as in complying with applicable laws. 
We impose our information security requirements on suppliers who 
handle customer data, as well as additional privacy requirements on 
suppliers who handle international personal data. 

Training. Verizon’s annual Code of Conduct training, which is mandatory 
for all full- and part-time employees, has substantial privacy and 
information security content. For targeted groups of employees, we 
supplement this general course with training on the handling of customer 
proprietary network information and other privacy and information 
security topics. We provide periodic reminders and communications to 
employees highlighting information security and privacy issues. Verizon 
also provides privacy and information security training to employees of 
third parties who have access to Verizon customer information. We are 
focused on continued improvement of the quality, quantity and cadence 
of third-party training. 

customer or for legal purposes. Our wireless and wireline customers can 
use the Verizon Privacy Dashboard to request data access, correction 
or deletion. Where provided by law, consumers have the right to appeal 
decisions. Outside of the U.S., data subjects may ask to access or delete 
personal data consistent with local laws. 

Consumer inquiries. Customers and others can contact Verizon’s 
Privacy Office electronically and by postal mail. Dedicated privacy team 
members review these inquiries and respond to questions related to our 
privacy practices around specific products, services or programs and 
help customers exercise their privacy and marketing choices. 

Privacy impact assessment processes 

We utilize a privacy impact assessment process to understand how 
a new product or system collects, uses, retains and shares data and 
to identify applicable legal, regulatory and policy requirements. This 
process aligns in many respects with the policies outlined in the U.S. 
Office of Management and Budget’s Guidance for Implementing the 
Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002 (OMB M-03-22). 
We also evaluate certain activities through a data protection assessment 
process designed to identify risks for certain types of activities that 
present heightened privacy impacts. 

Children’s privacy 

Customer and data subject rights. Customers and other individuals in 
the U.S. can obtain from Verizon the personal information that we have 
collected from or about them and may request that we correct or delete 
personal information. We honor requests to delete personal information 
except to the extent such information is needed to provide service to the 

We comply with applicable laws related to the privacy rights of minors, 
including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). When 
Verizon operates online services covered by COPPA, we do not 
knowingly collect personal information from children under age 13 
without parental consent, except where such collection is expressly 

permitted under COPPA for purposes of internal operations. We 
provide parents with information about their rights under COPPA, 
including instructions about how they can review information collected 
from children. 

Privacy and security by design 

To consider and mitigate privacy, security and human rights issues from 
the earliest stages of new product development, we apply a “privacy 
and security by design” approach. We take other appropriate steps 
to provide our customers with meaningful post-launch privacy and 
security protections. 

Requests from law enforcement 

Verizon publishes semi-annual reports that present the number of 
demands for customer information we receive from law enforcement 
in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business. To learn more 
about how we handle these requests, see our most recent Transparency 
Report.

Responsible AI Program 

Verizon’s Responsible AI Principles 

Verizon, like many companies, uses AI to improve our products, services 
and business operations. We understand that poorly governed AI 
applications can result in unintended consequences, including potential 
bias or discrimination, whether in design, implementation or the data 
sets used to train AI models. Verizon’s Artificial Intelligence and Data 
organization, together with our Data and Analytics Office, manages 
and implements Verizon’s centralized, enterprise-wide Responsible 
AI Program. 

Our Responsible AI Program is overseen by a dedicated team with 
support from other internal subject matter experts, including our Privacy 
team and Business & Human Rights Program. This program is governed 
by a risk-based approach and informed by emerging global definitions, 
concerns, frameworks, regulations and legislation in AI and related fields. 

We are guided by a set of foundational principles that provide direction 
to the many V Teamers using AI and align Verizon’s use of AI with the 
values of our Credo, as summarized in the table to the right. While 
these principles do not represent the full breadth of AI issues, they are 
intended to inform common terminology for AI-related efforts, guide our 
efforts to leverage new AI technologies in ways that positively impact 
our stakeholders and establish Verizon as a trusted brand and partner 
with respect to AI. 

Governance 

Respect for privacy 

Verizon employs a risk-based framework for developing, using and overseeing AI. We 
have processes to oversee Verizon’s development and use of AI, and our highly skilled 
employees have an important role to play in considering the risks, impacts and benefits of 
using AI. 

Verizon recognizes that AI systems must incorporate a privacy-by-design approach, 
including consideration of the data used to train models and the data used to make 
business decisions. Verizon’s use of AI must comply with our privacy policies and 
applicable laws. 

Respect for human rights & responsibility 
 to society 

We design and train Verizon systems using strategies to identify and reduce unfair bias 
and societal harm. We address the risk of unlawful or unintended bias in AI systems with 
appropriate governance and mitigation measures. 

Technical robustness 

Transparency 

Verizon uses industry-accepted metrics to evaluate AI solutions’ ability to generate 
accurate, reliable and reasonably consistent outputs. We employ a security-by­
design approach, which proactively and holistically monitors for and mitigates against 
security threats. 

Verizon understands that in order to provide reliable and positive user experiences, our 
use of AI systems requires transparency. Verizon is committed to clearly explaining its 
governance, use and monitoring of AI systems.

Verizon 2023 ESG ReportApproachV TeamersOperational integrityEnvironmentCommunityAppendixDigital accessibility 

Digital safety 

Verizon provides products and services that are accessible to the 
broadest range of customers. We have a diverse team of accessibility 
professionals who are continuously working to make each customer’s 
experience the best it can be. Our commitment to “accessibility by 
design” means that we are constantly working to incorporate the needs 
of people with disabilities into our initial design process of new products, 
services, digital information systems, web content, physical spaces 
and other facilities. We collaborate with our Advocates for Disability, 
Accessibility, Neurodiversity and Caregiver Empowerment (ADVANCE) 
employee resource group, as well as industry partners, to remain 
informed about accessibility issues and to improve user experiences. 

Verizon’s dedication to providing a digitally accessible experience 
begins with compliance. To optimize the digital experience for all of 
our customers, we strive to meet or exceed the online accessibility 
standards recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium in its Web 
Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA). For more information, 
see our Accessibility Resource Center. 

Our services and tools are made for the way our customers 
communicate and include support like visual assistance, accessible 
content, auditory support and mobility tools. We continually test the 
accessibility of our products using the same assistive technology as 
our users: screen readers, keyboard-only navigation and alternate-
input devices. We also check color contrast, closed captioning and 
transcriptions. We have standardized processes and procedures for 
proactive and reactive testing to resolve accessibility bugs across our 
products. These initiatives are critical to our ongoing efforts to level the 
digital playing field. 

Helping parents keep children safe online 

Verizon provides parents with products and services that empower 
them to make the best decisions about how to guide and moderate their 
children’s online experiences. 

We work to keep parents up to date on the latest online safety advice 
through our Parenting in a Digital World portal, which features guidance 
for parents of children of all ages. Parents can easily find practical 
advice on topics that range from screen time for toddlers to teen driver 
safety. Information on the portal is carefully vetted and comes from a 
variety of expert sources. 

Verizon also offers parents a portfolio of products and services that give 
them the ability to customize their children’s digital experience through 
robust parental controls and differentiated product offerings. Verizon’s 
Smart Family application gives parents the tools to monitor their child’s 
online activity, block harmful content, track location and view driving 
behavior. Verizon also offers a suite of products designed specifically for 
children, which is featured on Verizon’s Family Tech hub. 

Combating online child exploitation 

We recognize that we have an important role to play in combating the 
use of the internet to exploit children. As a leading provider of internet 
access services and cloud storage, we understand that the same tools 
that empower our customers to communicate with family and friends 
and safeguard their digital memories can also be misused to disseminate 
child sexual abuse material. 

Verizon’s work to combat online child sexual abuse and exploitation 
begins with close partnerships with two organizations on the frontline 
of the fight: the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children 
(NCMEC) and the Technology Coalition. Verizon is a Protector-level 
sponsor of NCMEC. We also chair the Board of Directors of the 
Technology Coalition, the leading industry working group fighting online 

39 

child exploitation. Through our work with the coalition, Verizon has 
helped enable Project Protect, an ambitious and multifaceted plan to 
eradicate online child sexual exploitation and abuse through investments 
in technology, collective action, transparency and accountability, 
information and knowledge sharing and independent research. 

In addition to our strong partnerships, we have implemented measures 
to protect our platforms from child predators that include: 

•		 Scanning images and videos uploaded to Verizon Cloud with 

PhotoDNA and CSAI Match, technology products that enable us 
to match uploaded media against databases of known child sexual 
abuse material 

•		 Conducting human reviews to evaluate the material flagged by our 

scanning technology and take action on user reports of child sexual 
abuse material. All confirmed child sexual abuse material is reported to 
NCMEC, which acts as a clearinghouse for law enforcement 

Robocalls 

We provide our customers with ways to directly protect themselves from 
robocalls. A robocall is an automatically generated and/or prerecorded 
phone call that can be a nuisance, and in many cases, a threat. Learn 
more about Verizon’s tools to identify and filter robocalls here. 

Radio frequency emissions 

Verizon equipment complies with Federal Communications Commission 
requirements that all wireless communication devices sold in the U.S. 
meet guidelines for safe human exposure to radio frequency energy. We 
provide more information on radio frequency emissions on our website.

TCFD summary
 


To provide a comprehensive view of how we understand and manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change at Verizon, we have published three standalone reports aligned with the guidelines of the Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This summary highlights information provided in our TCFD reporting. 

Board oversight 

Risk identification and management 

Strategy 

Our Board of Directors oversees Verizon’s strategy for managing 
climate-related risks and opportunities directly and through its 
committees. The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee, which 
oversees corporate responsibility, sustainability and public policy, 
monitors our progress on meeting climate-related goals. The Audit 
Committee, which oversees Verizon’s enterprise risk management 
program, reviews risks related to network reliability and resilience, 
energy and emissions management and climate-related regulation during 
annual business risk reviews. The Finance Committee oversees our 
renewable energy purchase and green finance programs. 

Management responsibility 

Verizon’s Executive Climate Oversight Committee, composed of the 
leaders of our Finance, Legal, ESG, Sustainability and Centralized 
Operations teams, has direct responsibility for assessing our climate-
related risks and opportunities and recommending changes to our 
strategy. The Responsible Business Council, Strategic Leadership 
Council and Board of Directors are regularly updated on our strategy for 
managing climate-related risks and opportunities and our progress in 
meeting our climate-related targets.  

We have processes that allow us to proactively identify, assess and 
prepare for climate-related risks. We also continue to integrate climate 
risk variables into our overall risk management process and establish 
formal, cross-functional processes that engage both our Board of 
Directors and management team. 

Our annual enterprise-wide climate-related risk assessment asks senior 
leaders and subject matter experts to identify and evaluate the impact 
of climate-related risk on our business, strategy and financial planning 
over short, medium and long time horizons. We share the results of the 
assessment with senior leaders who have primary responsibility for 
addressing risks related to the operations within their purview. Decisions 
on whether and how to prioritize, mitigate, accept or adapt to a particular 
identified climate risk are made at the business unit level and reviewed 
with the Executive Climate Oversight Committee. 

We leverage information from third-party sources, as well as lessons 
learned from severe weather and other natural events, to integrate 
climate-related risks into planning for Verizon’s network operations. 
We use geospatial analysis to evaluate the impact of climate-related 
events, including storm surge from hurricanes, flooding, wildfire, high 
straight-line wind and tornadoes on our current and future operational 
and network models. This analysis highlights necessary investments to 
increase infrastructure resilience. 

Verizon’s business strategy is centered around our world-class networks. 
To mitigate the potential effects of transition and physical climate-
related risks on our business, we: 

• Maximize the energy efficiency of our networks, facilities and fleet and

transition to renewable energy where practicable

• Reduce waste and responsibly manage natural resources

• Develop solutions to help our customers transition to a

low-carbon economy

• Upgrade and harden our infrastructure to be prepared for a

changing climate

Verizon’s emissions profile
 

Even as our network grows, our emissions continue to decrease. While Verizon has voluntarily disclosed the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with our operational energy consumption (scope 1 and 2) since 2004, 2019 
was the first year for which we reported our value chain (scope 3) emissions. As such, 2019 serves as the baseline year for our climate goals. 

Scope 1 

Scope 2 

Scope 3 

All direct sources of emissions owned or controlled 
by Verizon, with the main categories being fuel to 
power our fleet, heat our buildings and power our 
backup generators. 

Indirect emissions from energy purchased by 
Verizon. The largest category is electricity to power 
our networks and data centers, with a small amount 
of steam and heat purchased to heat our buildings. 

Indirect emissions associated with Verizon’s 
upstream and downstream value chain. The largest 
categories are purchased goods and services, 
capital goods, fuel- and energy-related activities (not 
included in scope 1 or 2) and use of sold products. 

External assurance 

We obtain independent limited assurance of our 
scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions annually. See the 
Independent Accountants’ Review Reports for more 
information. Our 2023 data are being assured and 
will be reported later in 2024 on our Emissions

Carbon reduction strategy
 

As we plan for a low-carbon future, we are minimizing our environmental footprint through emissions and energy management across Verizon and our value chain. To embed climate awareness across the enterprise, Verizon’s short-
term incentive plan for management employees includes a performance measure related to carbon intensity reduction. 

We are reducing operational (scope 1 and 2) emissions by phasing out 
use of fossil fuels in our buildings and fleet, improving energy efficiency 
across our networks and facilities and transitioning to renewable energy. 
We are tackling our value chain (scope 3) emissions through strategic 
supplier engagement and product life cycle management. To address 
residual emissions that we are ultimately unable to abate, we plan to 
pursue carbon removal solutions. 

Scope 1 strategy 

Strategic building decarbonization 

Verizon’s Strategic Decarbonization Audit program is designed to identify 
and implement cost-effective energy conservation initiatives across our 
real estate portfolio. Each year, we select sites for the program based 
on criteria including on-site fuel use, building age and size, overall energy 
performance and the impact of state and local building performance 
standards. These sites undergo an extensive, year-long audit, focusing 
on the electrification of HVAC systems, as well as solutions customized 
to the particular challenges present in many of our technical facilities. 
The most impactful electrification, energy conservation and retro-
commissioning measures are then implemented over a one- to two-year 
project cycle. 

Fleet decarbonization 

We are taking a multifaceted approach to reducing our fleet emissions. 
We have replaced aging bucket trucks, other than those outfitted for 
special uses, with trucks with hybrid drive systems. These vehicles 
utilize a battery system to power the aerial lift, eliminating the need for 

the truck’s engine to be on to perform work on Verizon infrastructure. 
We are pioneering technology to replace gas-powered generators in 
fiber splicing vans with an electric battery system capable of powering 
equipment for days at a time. In 2021, we conducted an engine 
calibration on nearly all of legacy Fios vans not yet at end-of-life to 
decrease the vehicles’ emissions without compromising their functional 
abilities. We are also reducing fleet emissions by utilizing optimized 
vehicle dispatching technology to minimize the miles driven to service 
our networks. 

The lack of electric vehicle (EV) models suitable for our commercial 
operations poses a challenge to our fleet electrification efforts. While 
production of light-duty EVs has been increasing to meet a variety 
of consumer uses, there are few—if any—EV options for the larger, 
specialized commercial vehicles on which our operations depend. 
Despite these challenges, we are in the process of transforming our 
fleet from relying on internal combustion engines to using clean energy 
technologies. We are planning to electrify a substantial portion of our 
customer-facing fleet by replacing our oldest light-duty vehicles with 
EVs. We are purchasing these EVs at a rate aligned with available 
products and charging infrastructure suitable for our operations. As EVs 
are introduced into our fleet, we are training impacted members of the V 
Team on the fundamentals of EVs, high voltage system safety and safe 
EV operation. 

In addition, we are closely collaborating with manufacturers and actively 
participating in industry organizations to spur the manufacture of 
special-use-case commercial EVs in order to electrify our non-customer­
facing light-duty vehicles, as well as our medium- and heavy-duty 
operational vehicles, to the greatest extent practicable. We are also 
collaborating with manufacturers, utilities and fellow fleet operators 
to discuss opportunities to advance commercial fleet decarbonization

Scope 2 strategy 

Energy efficiency management 

Effective energy management is not only necessary for the transition to 
a low-carbon economy but also lowers operating costs now and into the 
future. We are reducing energy use across our networks, data centers 
and building portfolio. 

Network. Verizon’s strategic focus on network modernization and 
decommissioning (i.e., powering down) of legacy equipment that no 
longer serves business or customer needs continues to result in 
significant energy savings. As part of a wireline network transformation 
initiative, we have been discontinuing copper-based services 
or migrating these services to fiber technologies, allowing us to 
decommission energy intensive switches and utilize our newer intelligent 
edge network platforms. Our fiber-delivered broadband services are 
at least 100 times more efficient on a kilowatt hour (kWh) per gigabyte 
basis than copper-delivered broadband services.4 

We shut down our 3G wireless network as of January 2023 and 
powered off all 3G wireless cell sites. We are also implementing a variety 
of initiatives to effectively manage energy consumption throughout our 
active 4G and 5G networks, including: 

•	  Powering down radios when they are not in active use

•	  Relocating heat-generating network equipment from indoor locations

to outdoor locations

•	  Upgrading cell site HVAC systems

•	  Auditing sites to understand where improvements are needed to meet

our high standards of energy efficiency

•	  Partnering with suppliers to enable more energy-efficient

network equipment

We are pursuing opportunities to transition our networks to clean energy 
sources. For example, we are partnering with the National Renewable 
Energy Laboratory to study the feasibility of solar power installation at 
remote off-grid sites that rely on fuel-powered generators. 

45 

To further maximize energy efficiency, we implement network cooling 
processes that reduce overall site energy usage and maintenance costs 
while extending the life expectancy of our equipment. We optimize 
settings at our network facilities to reduce cooling system demand. 
These adjustments are based on well-established industry guidelines 
and have no detrimental effect on network performance or reliability. 
We are deploying artificial intelligence (AI) solutions across a number 
of technical network facilities to enhance cooling system capacity 
and telecommunications equipment capabilities. We are replacing 
and upgrading older cooling systems with newer, high-efficiency 
systems that meet or exceed the latest industry energy-efficiency 
standards. These upgrades include systems equipped with “free 
cooling” economizers, which bring outside air into the HVAC system 
when it is cooler outside than inside, significantly reducing cooling 
energy consumption. 

Data centers. We design and operate our data centers for optimal 
energy efficiency. Our data centers leverage the full range of 
environmental tolerances allowed by most server, storage and network 
hardware suppliers, enabling us to implement energy-saving practices 
such as free cooling, waterside economizers, evaporative cooling, aisle 
containment and passive exhaust. We also leverage the full limits of our 
power and cooling infrastructure by monitoring and managing the power 
demand profile at each layer of distribution. In some locations, we use AI 
and machine learning algorithms to support energy conservation. 

Administrative and technical buildings. We continue to install energy-
efficient systems and employ energy management best practices at our 
buildings. Facility improvements include mechanical and whole-building 
control systems installation, LED lighting upgrades, high-efficiency 
motor replacement, steam and water leakage reduction, on-site solar 
deployment and HVAC system overhauls that replace aging equipment 
with heat pumps and adiabatic coolers. We continue to deploy IoT 
sensor networks to more intelligently manage building controls, 
optimizing for set temperatures and equipment energy consumption. 

Both domestically and globally, we are consolidating our real estate 
portfolio to more efficiently co-locate people and equipment, thus 
eliminating unnecessary building emissions. For example, we are 
currently moving a large technical facility in New York City into an 

existing office space. The project is utilizing cutting-edge energy 
technologies, including heat recovery chillers and submetering, which 
enables us to use meter-level data to understand operational efficiency 
on a micro level (e.g., lighting, HVAC, telecom equipment, etc.). 

Verizon is proud to partner with the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) ENERGY STAR program by pursuing ENERGY STAR 
certification for 100% of our eligible facilities. We have achieved 
677 ENERGY STAR certifications for our properties since 2001. 
For the 11th consecutive year, the EPA named Verizon an ENERGY 
STAR Partner of the Year and again recognized us with a Sustained 
Excellence designation. 

AI innovation. We are utilizing AI and machine learning capabilities 
to drive energy efficiency initiatives across Verizon. Projects under 
development include: 

•	  Developing an algorithm to enable solar panel battery storage

systems to discharge energy during peak periods when energy prices
are highest

•	  Creating a model to identify cell sites with anomalous energy

consumption

•	  Utilizing automation to reduce the number of truck rolls needed for

Fios dispatches

Transition to renewable energy 

Because most of our operational carbon footprint comes from the 
electricity that powers our networks, we have set targets to source 
renewable energy equivalent to 50% of our annual electricity usage by 
2025 and 100% by 2030. To demonstrate our commitment to the global 
transition to renewable energy, Verizon joined RE100 in 2023. 

Renewable energy purchase program. Our renewable energy purchase 
program is focused on supporting the transition to a greener U.S. 
electrical grid. As our U.S network operations are located across the 
country and require a constant supply of electricity, we are dependent 
on sourcing power from the grid. Today, much of that is “brown” power, 
produced from conventional fossil fuels, such as coal and oil. We are 
working to bring additional renewable energy to the grid by entering into

long-term renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) for solar and 
wind power under development. The agreements provide the developers 
of renewable energy facilities with long-term revenue certainty, enabling 
them to obtain the capital they need to construct new solar and wind 
energy facilities. 

underwriters that have established clear and impactful commitments 
in support of the UN SDGs, are a diverse-owned firm or have a core 
mission of promoting DEI. Our annual Green Bond Impact Report details 
the allocation of green bond proceeds and related impacts. 

REPAs can help reduce Verizon’s long-term exposure to energy price 
volatility. REPAs do not require physical delivery of energy. Rather, the 
facility operator sells the energy into the wholesale market, and we 
typically receive the renewable energy credits (RECs) associated with 
the energy sold. We retire these RECs against our actual electricity 
consumption to track our progress toward meeting our renewable 
energy targets. 

Outside the U.S., we aim to procure most of our electricity from 
renewable sources and obtain guarantee of origin certificates from our 
utility providers. 

On-site green energy. We are developing on-site green energy 
generation at our administrative offices and technical facilities. Since 
2013, we have installed 37.6 megawatts of on-site green energy 
generation currently in operation at our facilities. In addition to 
contributing to the achievement of our climate-related goals, our on-
site solar installations are a powerful signal to our employees and 
communities of Verizon’s dedication to sustainability. 

Green financing. We continue to seek ways to integrate sustainability 
considerations into our corporate finance processes, including through 
capital raising, investor communications and impact reporting. Verizon 
is one of the largest corporate green bond issuers in the U.S. Our 
green bond program is instrumental to our efforts to meet our interim 
renewable energy targets and long-term operational net zero goal. As of 
February 2024, we have issued a total of $6 billion of green bonds and 
have allocated approximately $5 billion of the net proceeds primarily to 
REPAs for new renewable energy projects. 

Our Green Financing Framework articulates our sustainable finance 
strategy and explains how our intended use of proceeds and selection 
of projects supports our environmental goals and advances the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Our Green 
Financing Framework also includes a pledge to only engage green bond

Scope 3 strategy 

Value chain engagement 

Most of Verizon’s emissions are generated by upstream activities outside 
of our direct operations. While accelerating decarbonization throughout 
our value chain is one of our biggest challenges, it also creates an 
opportunity for us to collaborate with our business partners to build a 
more resilient and sustainable supply chain for our sector. 

Supplier engagement. We are leveraging our participation in CDP’s global 
disclosure platform to drive emissions reduction in our value chain: 

•	  As part of the CDP Supply Chain program, we invited 318 of our
key suppliers to join us in responding to the 2023 CDP Climate
Change survey.

•	  Through the CDP Science-Based Targets Campaign, we are pressing

high-impact companies to commit to and set a science-based emissions
reduction target aligned with a 1.5°C scenario through the SBTi.

We have conducted a carbon maturity analysis of our key suppliers to 
identify where to focus our engagement efforts. We encourage all of our 
key suppliers to set emissions reduction targets, which we track through 
disclosure and assessment platforms such as CDP and EcoVadis. 

Standardized reporting and improved scope 3 data quality enable us 
to better understand the emissions from our value chain and ultimately 
manage them more effectively. As part of our supplier engagement, we 
convey our expectation for accurate and complete emissions data and 
we encourage independent external review and assurance. 

Industry collaboration. Industry collaboration is critical to reducing 
scope 3 emissions. Within the telecommunications sector, we are 
partnering with the Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative and the Joint 
Alliance for CSR to develop scope 3 emissions reduction strategies. 

We also participate in the MIT Climate & Sustainability Consortium, 
an academia-industry collaboration working to accelerate the 
implementation of climate solutions across sectors. 

Product life cycle management. We are working to reduce supply chain 
emissions throughout the life cycle of our products and accessories 
from design to end-of-life. Verizon maintains a teardown lab in which 
a team of engineers and cost modeling experts systematically 
deconstructs network equipment and devices to assess the efficacy and 
efficiency of their design. The lab’s core objective is to offer insights on 
design optimization to enhance product sustainability from production 
to disposal. To further reduce the emissions associated with our 
physical products, we are building out our internal life cycle assessment 
calculator. Our Circular Supply Chain team partners with teams across 
the company to extend the useful life of devices and other network 
equipment through repurposing. 

Renewable energy portfolio 

Verizon is one of the leading corporate buyers of renewable 
energy in the U.S. and a member of the Clean Energy Buyers 
Association. As of February 2024, we had in place 27 long­
term REPAs for a total of approximately 3.6 gigawatts (GW) of 
anticipated renewable energy generating capacity. As of such 
date, 15 projects related to our REPAs were in commercial 
operation. We have contracted for approximately 1.8 GW of the 
generating capacity of these projects, which represents over 
50% of the anticipated aggregate generating capacity of our 
REPA portfolio. The remaining projects are under development. 
The renewable energy capacity that we have contracted for is 
expected to enable the avoidance of over 4.7 million metric tons 
of CO₂e annually.5

Reducing our environmental impacts
 

We are committed to minimizing our environmental impact and have implemented policies and programs designed to responsibly manage the natural resources we use and the waste we produce. 

Environment, health and safety 
management 

Verizon’s Environmental, Health and Safety Policy, endorsed by Verizon 
leadership, describes our commitment to protecting the environment 
and the health and safety of the V Team, the public and the communities 
where we operate. 

Verizon’s Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) department is 
responsible for our EHS management system, which provides a 
framework for identifying, controlling and reducing the risks associated 
with our operations and reinforcing environmental stewardship. Besides 
performing regular management system assessments, we also conduct 
internal and third-party annual compliance audits and inspections at 
facilities worldwide. These assessments aim to identify site-specific 
issues and to educate and empower employees to take corrective 
actions. Our EHS efforts are directed and sustained by experienced 
professionals who support our global operations and facilities. 

Verizon’s EHS department maintains International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) 14001 (environmental) and ISO 45001 
(occupational health and safety) certifications for our EHS management 
system. Certification shows that our EHS department’s processes meet 
international best practices, drive continual improvement and create 
business value. 

Responsibly managing natural resources 

Water conservation 

As water is a critical natural resource, we implement water conservation 
measures throughout our operations. Verizon consumes the most water 
at our technical facilities, which require a controlled, cool environment 
for network equipment. We manage water consumption in these facilities 
through cooling tower and cable dehydrator upgrades and maintenance. 
Our continued implementation of energy efficiency measures in our 
technical buildings also helps to reduce water consumption. We are 
further conserving water as we consolidate leased and owned buildings 
and adjust our HVAC systems in our administrative offices to reflect our 
adoption of a hybrid work environment. We reduced our water usage by 
16% from 2019 to 2022. 

External assurance. We obtain independent limited assurance of 
our annual water usage results at our administrative offices, retail 
stores, data centers, central offices, equipment, garage work centers, 
warehouses and motor vehicle maintenance centers. Sites that do 
not routinely use water (e.g., network cabinets and huts, microwave 
equipment, towers and antennas) are excluded from the results. For 
details, including our full calculation methodology, read the Independent 
Accountants’ Review Report. Our 2023 water usage is currently 
undergoing independent limited assurance and will be reported in the 
Independent Accountants’ Review Report for 2023, which will be posted 
on our website later in 2024.

Responsibly managing waste 

Our EHS and Circular Supply Chain teams work internally across the 
company and externally with partners and suppliers to reduce, reuse and 
responsibly recycle materials. We recycled or reused nearly 79 million 
pounds of materials, including e-waste, in 2023. 

E-waste: reducing, reusing and recycling 

Verizon defines electronic waste, or e-waste, as electronic products and 
component parts that are at the end of their useful life and/or have been 
returned by customers. E-waste generated by our business operations 
includes cell phones, chargers, set-top boxes, network equipment, 
batteries and associated plastic components. In 2023, Verizon reused or 
recycled nearly 47 million pounds of e-waste, including 1.3 million pounds 
of plastic and 1.9 million pounds of lead-acid batteries. 

We strive to divert 100% of e-waste from landfills by reusing or 
responsibly recycling materials. To the extent practicable, we reuse 
electronic products and parts internally. When internal reuse is not 
possible, we market these materials for reuse through approved partners 
or work with suppliers to responsibly recycle them. Verizon’s Circular 
Supply Chain team partners with Corporate Sourcing to incorporate 
terms into our supplier contracts for the responsible end-of-life 
management of our products. 

Many of Verizon’s recycling practices exceed regulatory mandates. We 
engage e-waste suppliers that manage our waste in accordance with 
high industry standards for environmental stewardship such as R2 and 
e-Stewards. Our practice is to require lead-acid batteries from our U.S. 

operations to be sent to Verizon-approved recycling facilities in the 
U.S. or Canada and to require our suppliers to provide certificates of 
recycling for the batteries. We regularly audit facilities, including battery 
smelters, that manage Verizon’s hazardous or regulated waste. 

Device trade-in 

Verizon’s device trade-in program supports our circular economy 
approach to extending the lifespan of mobile devices and accessories. 
The program enables both Verizon and non-Verizon consumers to return 
qualifying, pre-owned devices in exchange for a Verizon credit or gift 
card. We repair, repurpose and resell these devices before pursuing 
responsible recycling at the end of their useful life. We refurbish and 
redistribute our home internet devices for 4G and 5G fixed wireless 
access and Fios service to customers. Consumers can also return 
obsolete devices for responsible recycling. 

Reducing plastic and other waste 

We are working to reduce the environmental impact of plastics in our 
products and product packaging, as well as in our day-to-day business 
operations. Our reduction efforts include: 

•	  Incorporating PCW, recycled plastic resin and ocean-bound plastics
in customer-premise equipment, such as routers, set-top boxes and
remote controls

•	  Eliminating single-use plastic packaging from our reverse logistics

operations (i.e., product take-back). Products impacted by this change
include home routers, optical network terminals and set-top boxes

•	  Modifying our supply chain product requirements for all customer-

premise products to state that product packaging should be designed
to eliminate or minimize the use of single-use plastics and non-
recyclable materials and that products should be designed to use
post-consumer recycled content to the greatest extent possible

•	  Using responsibly sourced packaging materials for Verizon-branded

screen protectors

•	  Collaborating with teams across the company to develop new uses for
the plastic harvested from old Verizon products. For example, plastic
from routers and set-top boxes has been given new life as road signs,
park benches and office chairs

Other waste reduction initiatives 

•	  Eliminating single-use plastics from our cafeteria and kitchen

facilities at our corporate headquarters

•	  Reselling and/or responsibly recycling surplus office furniture

related to building renovations and sales

•	  Designing assets for large marketing events, such as trade
shows, using repurposable materials that are more easily
reused at future events or responsibly recycled at their end
of life

Verizon’s technology solutions are already achieving efficiencies not 
only in our own operations but also for our customers. Our products, 
such as our smart building and smart transport solutions, enable our 
business customers to significantly reduce their energy consumption. 
We partner with cities to design infrastructure and systems that elevate 
the way they provide services in new and cost-effective ways. Our smart 
city solutions include intelligent lighting, intelligent traffic management 
and parking optimization. Verizon’s fleet management solutions help 
our customers improve fleet operations and reduce fuel consumption. 
Verizon’s networks also enable emissions reductions for our business 
and consumer customers through virtual connection solutions, including 
telecommuting and telehealth. Our 5G Home Internet offering is more 
efficient than 4G on an energy-per-bit basis and allows for customer 
self-installation of the service, reducing the need for a Verizon technician 
to drive to the customer. 

We partner with The Carbon Trust to measure the yearly CO₂ equivalent 
(CO₂e) emissions avoided by our customers through Verizon’s products 
and services. In 2023, we undertook a comprehensive review of our 
model, including the data that we provide to The Carbon Trust, and 
refined our model to enhance its relevance. Based on our refined model, 
Verizon solutions enabled the avoidance of over 20.1 million metric tons 
of CO₂e in 2023, which exceeded our previous expectations.6 Since 
2018, Verizon solutions have enabled the avoidance of over 93 million 
metric tons of CO₂e.

Verizon 2023 ESG ReportNetwork resilience 

Verizon is an industry leader in operating reliable and resilient networks that support our customers’ needs and keep them connected. Our networks in the U.S. include design elements, technologies and business processes that 
work together to enhance the reliability of our services. For more information about Verizon’s business continuity planning and disaster response efforts, see our latest TCFD report. 

The resilience of our networks reflects many years of significant 
investment that allows us to continue to serve our customers even 
in times of crisis, from extreme weather to other emergency events. 
We make enhancements to our facilities and networks based on 
assessments of the relevant geographic area and corresponding types 
of risks, for example: 

•  Fire. In fire-prone areas, we proactively eliminate brush and waste 

around our buildings and cell sites that could fuel fires. 

•  Hurricanes. In Florida, our “super switch” facilities can withstand 
Category 5 hurricane winds to enable us to continue to serve 
our customers. 

•  Tornadoes. In Missouri, our underground storage unit protects 

emergency vehicles and network equipment. 

•  Blizzards. Our sub-zero switch in North Dakota is housed in a building 

designed to withstand extreme snow, ice and flooding. 

•  Rising sea levels and flooding. Along the coast, we have elevated our 
cell towers and base stations to shield our power supply, generators, 
cooling systems and transport interface from rapidly rising waters. 

To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we have 
battery backup at every switch and every macro cell. We also utilize 
backup generators at a majority of our macro cells and at every switch 
location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that 
can be deployed as needed. In the case of fiber damage resulting from 
severe weather events, we may deploy satellite and microwave links to 
serve as alternative paths while the original infrastructure is repaired 
or replaced. For more information, see Managing systemic risks from 
technology disruptions in our SASB Standards index. 

Business continuity and event 
management 

Our Business Continuity and Event Management (BCEM) organization 
identifies risks, develops action plans and coordinates response and 
recovery efforts for all major disasters. An executive steering committee, 
composed of senior executives from across the enterprise, oversees our 
BCEM framework and programs. The BCEM framework, which follows 
Verizon’s corporate policy statement on national security emergency 
preparedness, is designed to protect and support Verizon personnel, 
critical operations and infrastructure during emergencies and disasters, 
including human-induced and weather-driven events. The framework 
supports operational preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery 
by weaving BCEM into Verizon decision making; focusing on internal 
and external partnerships; optimizing BCEM tools and technology and 
developing a comprehensive training program for the BCEM team, 
strategic partners and employees. 

The BCEM organization operates our Global Event Management 
Center (GEMC), which actively monitors and assesses potential 
threats to Verizon’s operations around the world. When a potential 
threat or significant event has been identified, the GEMC performs a 
risk assessment, consulting with internal and external subject matter 
experts, and disseminates situation information and intelligence to key 
response groups within Verizon. The GEMC leverages Verizon’s in-house 
weather monitoring platform that uses multiple sources of weather data 
to identify potential impact areas and conduct pre-storm risk preparation 
activities. Restoration teams and equipment are then stationed in those 
areas to protect our facilities and personnel. The GEMC also leads our 
event response efforts, including our crisis management teams. 

As a global company, Verizon aligns our internal business continuity 
program with several domestic and international industry standards, 
including, but not limited to, ISO 22301:2019 and ISO 22320:2018(E), 
FEMA NIMS and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38. 

Disaster response 

During times of crisis, Verizon stands ready to support first responders, 
communities, our customers and our employees with disaster response 
and recovery efforts. Verizon Frontline, our advanced network and 
technology product offering for first responders, provides on-demand 
emergency assistance to government agencies, first responders and 
public safety officials nationwide during crisis situations. Verizon has a 
collection of deployable assets standing ready to assist public safety 
teams, including two 53-foot mobile emergency calling centers, mobile 
cell sites, generators and repeaters, tethered drones and satellite 
communication capabilities. Our Tactical Humanitarian Operations 
Response vehicle, the first and only of its kind, serves as a mobile 
command center capable of deploying Verizon Frontline technology, 
including Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband and other high-quality communications 
and applications, under nearly any condition. 

After major natural disasters, the Verizon Response Team is on-site and 
available 24/7 to provide our affected customers and communities with 
critical resources, including Wi-Fi access and charging stations. The 
public can access real-time updates on Verizon’s relief and recovery 
efforts through our Emergency Resource Center, where we also share 
tips and resources on how to prepare for potential natural disasters.

Digital equity and inclusion
 

As Verizon builds the networks that move the world forward, we aspire to equip our communities with the tools needed to navigate an increasingly digital world. Our digital equity and inclusion efforts are focused in four key areas: 
advocacy, access, affordability and adoption. 

At Verizon, digital equity and inclusion means: 

Access 

Affordability 

•  Advocacy. Urging policymakers to create long-lasting solutions to 

address the digital divide 

•  Access. Providing access to connectivity with sufficient speeds to 

communities in remote and underserved areas 

•  Affordability. Making available devices and connectivity that offer 
quality service without significant cost or resource restrictions 

•  Adoption. Leveraging connectivity to provide meaningful services and 

fostering the skills necessary to use those services 

Advocacy 

We continue to advocate for long-term solutions to address the 
challenges of digital equity and inclusion. Our CEO chairs the World 
Economic Forum’s EDISON Alliance, which aims to mobilize industry 
sectors to quicken the pace of digital development and accelerate the 
opportunity for every person to participate in the digital economy. Our 
CEO also serves as a member of the UN Broadband Commission for 
Sustainable Development, driving progress toward achieving universal 
connectivity. 

We are focused on expanding broadband access to a greater number 
of rural U.S. households. The Investment in Infrastructure and Jobs 
Act (IIJA), passed by the U.S. Congress in late 2021, includes a historic 
investment of $65 billion to address these challenges and help states 
close the digital divide. States and localities may also use American 
Rescue Plan (ARP) funds to help build out high speed internet 
infrastructure. Verizon is reviewing available state and local subsidy 
programs and actively applying for funds to help bring our services to 
more locations where it makes sense for our network. We have already 
been awarded substantial ARP funding to deploy new broadband 
infrastructure within our wireline footprint, with more proposals still 
pending, and we are looking carefully at where funding from the IIJA, 
once available, could help support additional deployment. 

In addition to landline broadband service, we also offer fixed wireless 
access (FWA) through our 5G and 4G LTE wireless networks. FWA 
broadband can provide more robust and affordable internet access 
than may otherwise be available to consumers in certain markets. We 
continue to invest in our wireless network in rural and underserved 
U.S. markets, building new cell sites to provide additional coverage and 
expanding capacity on our existing cell sites to improve the performance 
of the network and our customers’ experience. 

As part of our ongoing mission to help make dependable and high-speed 
internet access affordable for all, we participate in the Lifeline program 
and will continue to participate in the Affordable Connectivity Program 
(ACP) if it is extended by Congress. The Lifeline and ACP programs are 
federal programs overseen by the Federal Communications Commission 
that provide subsidized internet services for eligible low-income 
customers. In addition, we voluntarily provide discounts on Fios and fixed 
wireless services to low-income families through our Verizon Forward

Climate protection 

At Verizon, we are mobilizing our resources, partnerships and people to help protect the planet for future generations. 

Opportunities to be a force for good for the planet are everywhere: 

Employee EV charging 

• We have set enterprise-wide targets to reduce the environmental 
impacts of our operations. For more information about our efforts 
to achieve net-zero emissions in our operations by 2035 through 
our renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives, see Carbon 
reduction strategy. 

• The V Team is actively engaged in our efforts to realize our goals and 

reduce our collective impact on the environment. 

• We are supporting technological innovation to help the communities 

where we work and live adapt to climate impacts and the transition to 
a low-carbon economy. 

Green Team 

The Verizon Green Team is a collective of employees dedicated to 
environmental stewardship and raising awareness around resource 
use and conservation. Green Team members around the world work to 
reduce Verizon’s environmental impact, as well as their own personal 
impact, by participating in a variety of curated volunteer and educational 
activities. These activities include green space cleanups, beautification 
projects and tutorials on topics such as eating green, composting and 
clean energy. In 2023, we celebrated our tenth year of partnership with 
NFL Green to host sustainability events in and around the host city of the 
Super Bowl, including tree plantings, river cleanups and school supplies 
donation drives for traditionally under-resourced communities. 

At year-end 2023, over 51% of V Teamers across 50 countries and 
territories were part of the Green Team, surpassing our goal of having 
50% of Verizon employees participating by 2026. 

55 

To encourage our V Teamers to use EVs with ease and confidence, we 
provide access to EV charging at 76 Verizon locations. 

Community solar 

Community recycling rallies 

To support our communities in safely recycling e-waste, Verizon 
sponsors free recycling events open to our employees and the public. 
Community members can bring in e-waste items, from personal 
computers to televisions to toasters, for safe disposal. We aim to collect 
and recycle 10 million pounds of e-waste from our communities by 
2026. Since 2009, we have collected approximately 8 million pounds of 
community e-waste for recycling. 

Tree planting 

Verizon is a member of the U.S. chapter of 1t.org, the trillion trees 
platform led by the World Economic Forum and American Forests 
to support the global movement to conserve, restore and grow one 
trillion trees worldwide. From replanting forests for hurricane recovery 
to supporting urban forestry, we are focused on restoring lost tree 
canopies and enabling cleaner air and healthier communities. Since 
2009, we have sponsored the planting of over 20 million trees, 
surpassing our goal to plant 20 million trees worldwide by 2030. 

We believe that the benefits of renewable power, such as 
reduced energy costs and increased resilience, should be 
available to members of our communities. That’s why we have 
invested in community solar programs in Massachusetts, New 
York, Arizona, Florida and California to deliver renewable power 
to local residents who otherwise could not access clean energy. 

Climate Resilience Prize 

We established the Climate Resilience Prize in 2022 to 
help scale proven, in-market solutions that mitigate the 
disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable 
communities. In 2023, we awarded a total of $500,000 to 
four winners leveraging advanced technology, including 5G, to 
develop climate resilience solutions. In addition to prize money, 
our 2023 winners will receive consulting services and may have 
the opportunity to pilot their product in partnership with Verizon.

Human prosperity
 

Our human prosperity efforts aim to connect people, especially those in marginalized communities, with the resources and opportunities necessary to achieve economic stability and realize their ambitions. 

Our company-wide commitment to human prosperity includes: 

•   Supporting the development of technologies that tackle major societal 

challenges 

•   Providing free upskilling and reskilling training programs 

•   Creating opportunities for employees to make a positive impact 

through volunteerism 

Verizon Forward for Good Accelerator 

The Verizon Forward for Good Accelerator supports startups using 
leading-edge technologies to tackle major societal challenges, such as 
climate justice, disability innovation and health equity. Over the course of 
a 16 week-program, the startups receive $50,000 in non-dilutive funding, 
technology coaching, expert mentorship, access to workshops with 
industry leaders and networking opportunities with potential partners 
and funders. 

Technology-focused career training 

In 2023, we invested over $27 million in programs to prepare members 
of our communities for jobs in the digital economy. We reimagined 
our Verizon Skill Forward program and widened its reach by offering 
tuition-free technical and professional learning pathways through a 
new strategic partnership with leading global online learning platform 
edX. Designed for participants without college degrees, Verizon Skill 
Forward offers self-paced, expert-led online courses, including Spanish 
language courses, created by leading universities. Verizon Skill Forward 
learners can access courses to build key job skills, including coding, 
communication, business intelligence, data analysis and finance. 

Our Verizon Community Forward initiative repurposes existing 
community infrastructure, such as libraries, recreation centers and 
community colleges, to provide community members—from youth 
to seniors—with dedicated learning centers. The initiative partners 
with local facilitators to offer STEM, workforce development, 
entrepreneurship and digital literacy programming. In 2023, we opened 
new centers in Houston, Texas, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 

Since 2019, our programs have prepared over 45,000 individuals for 
jobs in the digital economy now and in the future. 

Moving forward by giving back 

Employee volunteerism 

We leverage the V Team’s talents, passions and entrepreneurial spirit to 
make a positive contribution to our communities across our three Citizen 
Verizon pillars. We aim to dedicate 2.5 million volunteer hours by 2025. 
Since November 2019, the V Team has collectively volunteered over 
2.1 million hours to support our communities in areas including youth 
mentorship, older adult digital literacy, environmental conservation and 
veteran career coaching. 

Matching employee donations 

The Verizon Foundation matches V Teamers’ donations up to $1,000 
for personal charitable donations and up to an additional $5,000 for 
donations to eligible higher education institutions per year. Employees 
who volunteer at least 50 hours at an eligible nonprofit during a calendar 
year can generate a $750 donation from the Verizon Foundation to the 

organization. Within each calendar year, employees may generate up 
to two donations totaling $1,500 either to a single nonprofit or to two 
separate nonprofits. 

To support V Teamers displaced from their homes due to a natural or 
personal emergency, such as fire, flood, severe weather or domestic 
violence, the Verizon Foundation matches employee donations to the 
VtoV Employee Relief Fund. 

Supporting second chances 

We provide financial and volunteer support to social justice organizations 
working toward economic empowerment, civic engagement and criminal 
justice reform. 

We partner with the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth (CFSY) 
to support the human dignity and prosperity of people who were initially 
sentenced as children to life in prison and who are now returning to 
their communities. To further our work to connect these individuals to 
job training, employment and skill development, Verizon employees offer 
mentorship and training through our ADVANCE (Advocates for Disability, 
Accessibility, Neurodiversity and Caregiver Empowerment) and BOLD 
(Black Originators, Leaders and Doers) ERGs. 

Together with American University and Verizon’s VALOR (Veterans and 
Advocates Leading the Organization Responsibly) ERG, we created a 
digital guide that explains the importance of Veterans Treatment Courts 
as an alternative to incarceration of veterans suffering from mental 
health or substance abuse disorders. The guide features the stories of 
veterans who have successfully completed a treatment program.

Pro Bono Program 

Our Pro Bono Program supports vulnerable members of our community, 
including survivors of domestic violence, veterans claiming their rightful 
benefits and immigrants seeking to uphold their rights under the law. Our 
volunteers provide legal guidance to nonprofits and small businesses, 
enabling them to meet their obligations and focus on their core missions. 
We also mentor students from disadvantaged communities to show 
them the possibilities of careers at workplaces like Verizon. 

Our criminal justice reform initiatives include assistance with criminal 
records expungement, juvenile criminal sentence reduction in 
partnership with the CFSY and exoneration of wrongful incarceration in 
partnership with the Innocence Project. In 2023, volunteers from Verizon 
and our partner law firms staffed a day-long legal clinic hosted by the 
National Urban League in Houston, Texas. 

57 

Verizon 2023 ESG ReportApproachV TeamersOperational integrityEnvironmentCommunityAppendixCommunity engagement and support 

Our local community engagement program focuses on building impactful, long-term partnerships on a grassroots level with community leaders, nonprofit organizations and educators. Our ongoing community dialogues give us a 
deeper understanding of the challenges facing the communities we serve, target our support and investment in the areas with the greatest need and create effective corporate partnerships.

For the year ended December 31, 2023 
Published March 2024 

SASB Standards, now managed by the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) Foundation, enable companies to disclose consistent 
and decision-useful ESG information to investors. This index provides 
information with respect to the disclosure topics and accounting metrics 
in the SASB Standard for Telecommunications. In the following tables, 
quantitative data is followed by narrative information that contextualizes 
the data where appropriate and is also responsive to any qualitative 
metrics. The inclusion of information in this index should not be 
construed as a characterization regarding the materiality or financial 
impact of that information. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 2023, and other publicly filed documents, 
which are available on our Investor Relations website. 

Unless otherwise indicated, quantitative data is provided as of or for 
the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, where available. 
Where relevant, data measurement techniques, the bases of calculations 
and changes in the basis for reporting or reclassifications of previously 
reported data are noted. On November 23, 2021, we completed the 
acquisition of TracFone Wireless, Inc. (TracFone). Other than the metrics 
reported pursuant to TC-TL-000.A, TC-TL-000.C and TC-TL-220a.2, 
the metrics reported herein exclude TracFone results. 

Data assurance. Annually, Verizon obtains independent assurance of our 
emissions data and other select ESG indicators, including the metrics 
reported pursuant to TC-TL-000.D and TC-TL-130a.1 in this index. Read 
the Independent Accountants’ Review Reports for more information. 
For information that is not specifically identified as being independently 
assured, Verizon relies on the application of internal policies (including 
those requiring the creation and maintenance of accurate records 

and the establishment of internal controls over externally reported 
financial and non-financial information) and compliance with data quality 
standards and verification procedures set forth in our ESG information 
governance and control frameworks to validate such information. We 
will update this index to include the 2023 metrics that are currently 
undergoing independent assurance when the Independent Accountants’ 
Review Report with respect to those metrics has been issued. 

Note on non-financial reporting. Non-financial information is subject 
to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the 
nature of, and the methods used for determining, such data. Some of 
our disclosures in this index are based on assumptions due to these 
inherent measurement uncertainties. The selection of different but 
acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different 
measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may 
also vary.

The metrics include subpoenas, warrants and orders that we receive from federal, state and local law enforcement in the U.S., but do not include wiretap orders, pen register and trap and trace orders, national 
security demands and emergency requests, which we separately report in our Transparency Report. A customer selector is an information point, such as a telephone number, used to identify a customer. 
Verizon does not maintain a record of unique customers whose information was requested because multiple selectors may refer to the same customer (e.g., the same person may have multiple phone 
numbers) and selectors may be duplicated across requests (e.g., the same phone number requested in two subpoenas is counted as two selectors). We define a disclosure as a full or partial disclosure of 
information in response to a request.

Discussion of systems to provide unimpeded service during service interruptions 

Verizon is an industry leader in operating resilient and reliable networks that support the needs of our customers. Our networks in the U.S. include various design elements, technologies and business 
processes that work together to enhance the reliability of our services. 

Designed with dual path and equipment redundancy. Verizon’s network design includes redundancy on critical paths and for critical network components to mitigate the impact of network events on 
customers. We use forward-looking risk assessments to plan and maintain our fiber backhaul configuration for critical network sites. Such sites may contain traffic aggregation points, data centers or other 
technical facilities and typically have fiber backhaul deployed in a resilient ring or hub configuration, as well as dual diverse entrance facilities supporting our core infrastructure. Verizon has also implemented 
a “meshed” core network architecture, which enables network equipment to switch traffic almost instantly across multiple available transmission paths between two endpoints. When available, this enables the 
network to self-recover promptly from outages to physical facilities (e.g., a fiber cut). 

Use of battery and generator technology. To minimize the impact of power disruptions at critical sites, we deploy reserve power in the form of batteries and/or generators. Our switching facilities are 
equipped with battery backup power and generators. Macro sites have battery backup power as well, and the majority are equipped with generators. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators 
that can be deployed as needed. 

Reliability-focused business processes. To minimize the likelihood of congestion on our networks, Verizon proactively manages and augments network capacity based on defined thresholds associated with 
the expected voice, video, application and data traffic patterns across our network. To help ensure appropriate network diversity and redundancy, we perform several internal audits per year. Our engineering 
standards for strategic directional platforms require high availability equipment with auto-failover capabilities to protect critical services. Requirements for diversity and redundancy for critical paths and 
network sites are reviewed and addressed as part of network planning, engineering and operations activity. 

Overlapping spectrum and coverage areas. Verizon designs its wireless network to provide for overlapping spectrum and coverage areas in many cases. If a particular cell site goes offline, devices may 
switch to a different site and maintain connectivity. Different spectrum bands deployed on our 4G and 5G networks can provide customers with additional options for connectivity and capacity if certain bands 
or nodes experience an increase in usage. Most customer devices have the option to move seamlessly between our 4G and 5G networks and available Wi-Fi networks to provide our customers with a high 
degree of reliability. 

For more information on how we manage business continuity risk and the measures we have undertaken to make our networks more resilient, see Network resilience and our latest TCFD Report.

At Verizon, running our business responsibly is the foundation of our strategy, driving long term financial success by building a more sustainable future for our shareholders, customers, employees and society.

Operating as a responsible business is essential to earning our customers’ trust and building a world class brand.

By championing digital responsibility and inclusion, promoting diversity, mitigating climate risk and creating meaningful work for our employees, we are forging a purpose driven and resilient business, with long term growth and strong financial stability.

Citizen Verizon, our company wide responsible business plan, is an investment in the communities we serve that helps our customers today and builds our customer base for tomorrow.

We believe that Verizon and society benefit when everyone can meaningfully participate in the digital economy and have set ambitious goals to spur economic advancement in the communities where we live and work, including a commitment to provide 10 million youths with digital skills training by 2030.

I am proud to share that, through our transformative Verizon Innovative Learning initiative, we have provided over 7 million students nationwide with digital tools and resources so far.

We know that responsible business is good business, and our approach to climate considerations is tied to, and embedded in, our business strategy and operations.

Our green bond program allows us to finance our renewable energy program on terms that are often less expensive than our typical bonds.

Since we are a major consumer of renewables, our moves here also encourage the greening of the electric grid and the development of a renewable energy economy that will serve our needs, along with society’s.

In support of this effort, we have a target to source 100% of the energy we use in our networks from renewables by 2030.

Of course, none of these accomplishments would be possible without the tireless efforts of our V Team.

Delivering on Verizon’s strategy takes more than the best technology it takes the best people.

Providing our V Teamers with the skills to execute on our business priorities, offering opportunities for career advancement and ensuring a collaborative and inclusive work environment gives us a competitive edge now and into the future.

We believe integrity is at the core of who we are.

Verizon has dedicated cross functional teams to execute responsible business principles in our core operations, from our supply chain to product development to our stewardship of customer information.

These teams identify and manage the evolving risks and opportunities presented by our dynamic operating environment, including in technology such as artificial intelligence (AI).

In 2023, we released a set of Responsible AI Principles to guide our enterprise wide efforts to leverage new AI technologies in ways that positively impact our stakeholders and establish Verizon as a trusted brand and partner with respect to AI.

The ways in which we care for our customers, communities, environment and employees define our company.

I hope you share my excitement about the progress we made last year and the many opportunities ahead to deliver meaningful value to all our stakeholders for years to come.

The ways in which we care for our customers, communities, environment and employees define our company.

At Verizon, our world class networks are at the center of our business strategy to drive innovation and growth.

We are building the interconnected future and creating networks to move the world forward for everyone.

As we execute on our strategy, we consider how our business can create long term, measurable value for a broad set of stakeholders our shareholders, customers, employees and society.

Our ESG strategy is built upon four pillars: governance, integration, engagement and reporting.

Each of these pillars dynamically supports the others, providing us with a foundation for informed decision making, transparent communication and effective governance over and accountability for Verizon’s most impactful ESG risks and opportunities.

We deliver on our corporate purpose and our firm commitment to accountability through robust Board oversight and management governance structures.

We leverage dedicated expertise as well as generally accepted ESG frameworks to build governance structures that inform business decision making, embedding ESG considerations into the DNA of our company.

We publish decision useful information for investors and other stakeholders, leveraging insights from our integration and engagement efforts.

We engage with a broad range of external stakeholders to obtain a holistic view of our ESG impacts and strategy.

We implement effective governance over and accountability for our key ESG issues through Board and management oversight, stakeholder engagement and transparent reporting.

Our Board of Directors oversees Verizon’s ESG risks and opportunities with the assistance of four standing committees composed solely of independent Directors.

An independent Lead Director shares governance responsibilities with the Chairman and CEO and facilitates forthright communication and independent oversight of management’s performance.

We are committed to the highest standards of corporate governance.

See how our policies and practices align with the Investor Stewardship Group’s corporate governance principles for U.S. listed companies here.

Good governance starts with independent and engaged directors who respect differing viewpoints.

In its ongoing refreshment process, our Board seeks a diverse group of candidates who possess the requisite judgment, background, skill, expertise and time, as well as diversity with respect to race, ethnicity and gender, to strengthen and increase the overall diversity, breadth of skills and qualifications of the Board.

As of December 31, 2023, our 12 member Board included four women and five Directors who self identify as racially or ethnically diverse.

Each Verizon Director brings to the boardroom skills or experience in one or more of our priority ESG issues.

While the Corporate Governance and Policy Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing our ESG strategy, commitments, stakeholder engagement and reporting, the full Board regularly addresses ESG issues during business operations reviews and strategy discussions.

Each Board committee oversees the ESG risks and opportunities that fall under that committee’s purview, with each committee chair regularly updating our full Board on its ESG related activities.

ESG topics frequently included on committee agendas or addressed during management updates are listed in the table to the right.

For more information on how our Board and committees oversee ESG risks and opportunities, see the Oversight of ESG strategy and risks section in our 2024 Proxy Statement.

ESG strategy, commitments, engagement and reporting.

Public policy and technology issues impacting corporate reputation.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and employee engagement.

To gain a holistic perspective and appropriately assess risks and opportunities when making important decisions for the business, we have established a number of cross functional management councils composed of members of our executive leadership team.

These councils meet regularly to address a wide range of matters that are critical to our company’s success, including business and technology strategies, network and product development, customer experience and brand management, capital and expense allocation, emergency preparedness and responsible business initiatives.

The Strategic Leadership and Responsible Business councils are instrumental to the integration of sustainability considerations into our overall strategy and business operations, overseeing the establishment and execution of our climate related and social impact goals.

Our management councils operate using a year round planning and execution process.

This process unites strategy development, financial planning and budgeting, talent management and execution to make sure that each organization is coordinated as it implements Verizon’s strategy.

Each organization tracks key performance measures in the execution of individual initiatives.

These are compiled into one corporate wide scorecard that includes key performance measures for our operational net zero goal, employee engagement and DEI initiatives.

We also have cross functional management committees, supported by dedicated teams of experts, which oversee our implementation of policies and programs governing accessibility, artificial intelligence (AI), business continuity, climate, cybersecurity, DEI, global supply chain management and privacy.

We proactively engage with our investors, customers and other key stakeholders on Verizon’s ESG activities and priorities.

These engagements may include participation, when requested and appropriate, from our independent Lead Director, the chair of the Audit Committee or other Directors.

We believe that these transparent and collaborative exchanges strengthen corporate accountability, improve decision making and ultimately create long term value.

We regularly share what we learn with our Board and senior management.

In 2023, the topics most frequently addressed during these engagements included scope 3 emissions, human capital management, data privacy and cybersecurity.

We also seek to develop meaningful partnerships with external stakeholders to help ensure that Verizon’s policy positions are informed by the communities we serve.

Our Consumer Advisory Board (CAB), a diverse group of stakeholders that advises Verizon on a variety of consumer and policy issues, continued to meet throughout 2023.

CAB members serve as an informal focus group to test out new policies, practices and products and offer fresh thinking and key consumer insights on discrete business projects, pilots and case studies.

Our ESG reporting is aligned with leading sustainability disclosure frameworks and informed by emerging ESG related laws and regulations, our stakeholder engagement and the results of our ESG prioritization assessment.

Our ESG reporting and policies, as well as a downloadable ESG data table, can be found on our ESG Resources Hub.

Our ESG Center of Excellence, composed of teams from Enterprise Risk Management, Legal and Accounting Policy, is implementing an expanded internal control framework for ESG information to facilitate our compliance with ESG related laws and regulations.

We have been conducting periodic third party assessments over the past 10 years to identify the ESG issues that are the most relevant and impactful to our business and our four key stakeholders our shareholders, customers, employees and society.

We use the results of these assessments to guide our ESG strategy, focus our reporting and stakeholder engagement and prioritize our ESG integration efforts.

The environment, health and safety performance of each supplier is monitored to ensure that corrective actions are implemented.

The process was overseen by our Board of Directors and informed by input from employees responsible for leading Verizon’s DEI efforts, representatives from our ERGs and leaders from the civil and human rights communities.

This prohibition is reiterated in training, communications and during investigatory interviews.

The antitrust and compliance teams investigate any conduct suspected to violate antitrust laws and the Code of Conduct.

Employees in violation face repercussions ranging from retraining to termination.

We participate in the policymaking process at the federal, state and local levels in order to inform public officials of Verizon’s views on policy issues.

Government policies can have a significant impact on our business, whether they involve decisions on taxes, technology regulation or consumer issues like protecting user privacy and stopping illegal robocalls.

We participate in these conversations so that government decision makers understand how these policies could affect Verizon and our customers, employees and shareholders.

As part of our advocacy, we engage in lobbying at all levels of government through our own employees and through outside consultants.

Our Public Policy and Government Affairs organization approves any engagement of lobbyists on behalf of Verizon, and we strictly comply with all lobbying laws requiring disclosure of our activities and expenses.

Political contributions are one way we support the democratic electoral process and participate in the policy dialogue.

We do not make corporate political contributions or PAC contributions to presidential candidates or federal SuperPACs.

Verizon supports trade associations and issue advocacy organizations for a number of reasons, including to reflect our interest in the community, acquire valuable industry and market expertise and support our strategic policy positions, business goals and interests.

We recognize that we may not always agree with every position of each organization or its members and that these groups often have a diversity of members, interests and viewpoints that may not always reflect Verizon’s views or priorities.

In order to mitigate reputational risks associated with our engagement with these organizations, we regularly review our participation to confirm ongoing alignment with our corporate priorities and goals.

When we disagree with a position of an organization we support, we communicate our concerns through the senior executives who interact with these organizations.

Verizon participates in policy dialogues with appropriate governance, oversight and transparency mechanisms to mitigate reputational risk.

Verizon’s political activity is directly overseen by the Legal and Public Policy and Government Affairs organizations.

All of our political activity is subject to robust internal controls set forth in our Code of Conduct and other corporate policies.

The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our participation in the political process, including political giving, memberships in trade associations and reputational risk, and receives a comprehensive briefing on these activities at least annually.

Verizon understands that transparency regarding our political engagement is critical to maintaining the trust of our employees, shareholders and the public, so we publish our Political Engagement Report twice a year.

This report describes our current policy priorities, provides information about lobbying activities and our Public Policy and Government Affairs organization’s significant memberships in trade associations and issue advocacy organizations, and lists all of our PAC contributions, corporate political contributions, support for ballot initiatives and independent expenditures for the period covered.

Verizon is a responsible taxpayer that timely and accurately files all applicable tax returns, pays all applicable taxes and accurately reports taxes in our financial statements.

We are committed to maintaining a transparent and positive working relationship with tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

We also partner with tax authorities and governments to advocate for tax guidance and legislation that provides clarity, is administrable, reduces tax disputes and is socially and fiscally responsible.

Verizon has implemented formal tax governance policies, procedures and controls that strive to meet or exceed best practices on tax governance.

Our tax control framework is SOX compliant and subject to periodic review by the Senior Vice President Deputy General Counsel Corporate Taxes, Verizon Internal Audit and our external auditors.

Verizon’s tax principles, and compliance with them, are overseen by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, as well as the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal Officer.

Verizon’s Global Tax Policy provides that Verizon only engages in transactions that are supported by a non tax business purpose.

As such, we only operate in jurisdictions based on the needs of the business and the requirements of our multinational customers.

We do not utilize zero or low tax jurisdictions outside the U.S. to minimize our taxes, and we do not engage in tax shelter transactions or transactions that have been identified as listed transactions or transactions of interest by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.

In addition, Verizon’s transfer pricing policies are based on the arm’s length principle and compliance with guidelines and documentation requirements set by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Verizon’s Human Rights Statement, grounded in our Credo, sets forth our commitment to respecting internationally recognized human rights.

Our approach to human rights governance is guided by the human rights due diligence framework set forth in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

Verizon’s dedicated Business Human Rights Program leads our human rights governance efforts.

We take a structured approach to integrating and embedding human rights considerations into decision making processes across the company.

Our efforts include attention to the human rights impacts of our products, services, strategy and operations and to our engagements with employees, customers, communities, governments, business partners and suppliers.

The Business Human Rights Program undertakes these efforts with support from a global cross functional team of internal partners and with oversight from the Corporate Governance and Policy Committee of our Board of Directors.

Our Business Human Rights Program provides Verizon employees with tools, guidance and targeted training to support the company’s efforts to operate in a manner that is consistent with our commitment to respect human rights.

A learning module is available to all Verizon employees with information on international human rights, our company’s efforts to respect human rights and the work of the Business Human Rights Program.

Our Business Human Rights Program conducts ongoing human rights due diligence to identify, understand and address human rights risks that may intersect with our business.

Our due diligence efforts include strategic human rights impact assessments, when appropriate.

These strategic human rights assessments are informed by consultation with internal teams and external stakeholders from industry, civil society, academia and the communities where we do business.

In 2022, we published findings from Verizon’s first child rights impact assessment.

The assessment examined Verizon’s potential impacts on children across all aspects of our operations, including impacts in connection with digital access, inclusion and skills digital safety product design and our supply chain.

For more information on our human rights due diligence and assessments, see our Human Rights website.

Our human rights work focuses on our salient issues: the right to privacy, the right to be free from discrimination, the right to freedom of expression and opinion, rights in the workplace and rights in the supply chain.

In 2023, we undertook a refresh of our saliency assessment and considered both changes to our business and the impacts of external trends.

The 2023 refresh confirmed and provided new insights on our salient issues and the focus areas of our human rights work.

We conducted a human rights impact assessment focused on our impacts and opportunities in a 5G enabled technology era.

This assessment examined 5G technology from the perspective of a network operator and looked at the roles and responsibilities of different actors in respecting human rights in an increasingly interconnected 5G technology ecosystem.

Our Business Human Rights Program works closely with internal teams to build governance mechanisms and provide transparency about Verizon’s approaches to privacy, free expression and non discrimination.

For example, our newly published approach to AI governance that guides our development, acquisition, deployment and use of AI includes a principle relating to respect for human rights and responsibility to society.

For more information, see our Responsible AI Program.

We continue to support our digital rights work through our membership in the Global Network Initiative, the leading multi stakeholder initiative in the information and communications technology sector.

Verizon’s supply chain is the foundation of our secure network.

Our suppliers range from the world’s largest original equipment manufacturers to smaller providers of equipment, hardware, software and various services.

We have implemented risk mitigation processes and an active supplier engagement program to build a diverse, resilient and responsible supply chain.

Our enterprise wide supplier diversity initiative aims to build a supply chain that is as diverse as the communities we serve.

We believe that accelerating diverse business development strengthens the supplier ecosystem.

Verizon’s Center of Excellence for Supplier Diversity leads our enterprise wide supplier diversity program, working with a network of business unit supplier champions from across the company to set internal supplier diversity targets, track our diversity spend goals and reporting obligations, implement training for employees and suppliers and monitor progress through regular analytics and reporting.

Our Supplier Diversity team also works closely with our Sourcing organization to confirm that suppliers from traditionally underrepresented, disadvantaged or minority groups are positioned to compete for new contracts and opportunities.

We are a charter member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable, a coalition formed in 2001 of companies that each spend more than 1 billion every year with diverse businesses.

Verizon continues to demonstrate leadership in promoting the growth of diverse firms in the debt capital markets.

Over the past year, we partnered with 10 diverse firms across all of our eligible unsecured debt capital markets transactions and asset backed securities (ABS) offerings.

We also allocated 40.6% of gross unsecured debt capital markets fees to diverse firms and awarded 9.6% of ABS underwriting fees to diverse firms.

Outside of the debt capital markets, we continue to support diverse managers in our defined benefit pension plan.

Assets under management with diverse firms constituted 5.3% of the defined benefit pension plan assets as of December 31, 2023.

To further strengthen our efforts, our short term incentive plan for management employees has included a performance measure related to supplier diversity for over 15 years.

Verizon expects all of our suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier Code) and maintain policies and procedures to guard against illegal activity such as corruption, extortion, embezzlement and bribery.

Our Supplier Code also forbids the use of child labor and forced labor, protects employees’ rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, as permitted by local laws, and prohibits discrimination on any basis prohibited by applicable law.

We reserve the right to review or audit our suppliers’ compliance with the Supplier Code.

We recognize that our reputation is affected by the actions of the agents authorized to participate in the sale of our services and equipment to customers.

Our Sales Agent Standards of Conduct (Sales Agent Standards) detail the behavior and values that we expect our sales agents to uphold.

Any party can raise questions or concerns or report potential or actual violations by contacting Verizon Ethics via email or through our confidential portal and hotline, available at verizonethics.com.

We leverage third party platforms and industry partnerships to embed responsible business practices throughout our supply chain.

In addition to submitting our own annual EcoVadis response, we use the EcoVadis assessment tool to evaluate our suppliers’ responsible performance.

We monitor and assess supplier performance in four areas: environment, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement.

Since 2013, we have assessed 728 key suppliers through our partnership with EcoVadis.

When weaknesses are identified, we work with the supplier to create a corrective action plan to improve their current activities, benefitting both Verizon and the supplier.

Verizon is a member of the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC), an association of telecommunications operators that collaboratively audits common suppliers and looks for opportunities to improve supplier responsibility across our industry.

JAC audits are based on a common verification, assessment and development methodology, including the generation of corrective action plans.

Topics covered by these audits include child labor, forced labor, worker health and safety, freedom of association, non discrimination, disciplinary practices, working hours, wages and compensation, environmental protection and business ethics.

Through 2023, 1,060 supplier audits had been completed since JAC’s inception in 2010, with 150 audits completed in 2023.

Verizon’s Third Party Risk Management Program supports the company’s responsible sourcing efforts.

Managed by a dedicated team, the program enables Verizon to identify, assess, monitor and manage a range of supply chain risks, including those that may be associated with the social and environmental impacts of supplier activity.

The Third Party Risk Management team works closely with teams across the company to implement a risk management framework and make recommendations regarding future supplier engagement.

This work happens throughout the supplier life cycle, including during planning, due diligence, contracting, ongoing monitoring and termination.

The Third Party Risk Management team is responsible for providing program oversight, coordination and support to stakeholders across Verizon.

Supply chain risk management is reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors as part of business risk reviews held throughout the year.

A resilient supply chain is an effective supply chain.

Verizon’s Supply Chain Resilience Management Program identifies, assesses, monitors and manages supply chain risks, including disruptions caused by natural and human induced events, to better coordinate our supply chain activities and aid the effectiveness of our controls.

The program monitors how Verizon employees and business partners manage the life cycle phases of our physical products, software, firmware and services.

The program also assesses whether stakeholders need to improve their procedures to more effectively mitigate supply chain risks as they relate to four key categories: security, integrity, resilience and quality.

This work is guided by our corporate policy statement on supply chain resilience management and overseen by our cross functional Global Supply Chain Resilience Governance Council.

Verizon is dedicated to responsible sourcing practices that support human rights, ethical conduct and environmental protection.

We collaborate with suppliers and industry partners to strengthen responsible sourcing practices around the world.

Verizon is committed to assessing and addressing the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking within our business operations and supply chain.

Our Business Human Rights Program, Business Risk, Sourcing and Third Party Risk Management teams review the nature and extent of our exposure to the risk of modern slavery on an ongoing basis, focusing on areas of Verizon’s supply chain that may be at higher risk.

Our efforts are also informed by engagement with industry peers through organizations such as JAC.

Our Business Risk team is trained on modern slavery and human trafficking risk and carries out reputational risk due diligence on new and existing suppliers.

The team escalates any potential risk factors to the Third Party Risk Management and appropriate legal teams for review.

We describe our efforts in more detail in our country specific human rights due diligence statements.

Verizon’s conflict minerals due diligence framework was designed to align with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict Affected and High Risk Areas.

Our approach takes into account our position in the conflict minerals supply chain and the fact that Verizon does not typically contract to manufacture the products associated with our business.

We require our suppliers, when appropriate, to take steps to verify that their products do not include materials that either directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or in any adjoining country.

We also participate in industry initiatives and partnerships to support responsible raw material sourcing in high risk countries and regions, including the Responsible Business Alliance and the Public Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade.

We recognize that we have a responsibility to our customers, employees, business partners and shareholders to guard against the risks that come with operating in an increasingly digital world.

Verizon’s comprehensive cybersecurity program is designed to identify and protect against cybersecurity risks and to position Verizon to rapidly detect, respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents that impact our company.

Our program is aligned to the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Cybersecurity Framework, which outlines the core components and responsibilities necessary to sustain a healthy and well balanced cybersecurity program.

We continually assess the cybersecurity threat and vulnerability landscape using various commercial, government and publicly available information sources.

We use both manual and automated detection methods on a scheduled and ad hoc basis to identify vulnerabilities within, and threats to, our operations and network infrastructure.

Once a cybersecurity vulnerability is detected, we assign a threat severity classification based on the risk profile associated with the vulnerability.

Verizon’s information security team reports all cybersecurity vulnerabilities and their associated threat classification to the appropriate business team for remediation.

Deadlines for remediation are set based on the severity of the threat and closely tracked in a central system of record.

In the instances when a remediation deadline cannot be met, the information security and business teams work together to deploy appropriate mitigating or compensating controls until the remediation work is complete.

We track the performance of our cybersecurity program by collecting, retaining and analyzing a broad range of data related to our threat identification, detection and response activity.

We use this data to assess threat trends, for strategic planning purposes and to enhance management accountability for cybersecurity.

Verizon has a comprehensive enterprise cybersecurity incident response plan, which is activated in the event of a cybersecurity incident.

The plan is a detailed playbook that specifies how Verizon classifies, responds to and recovers from cybersecurity incidents and includes notification procedures that vary depending on the significance of the incident.

When warranted by the severity of the incident, our Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives are part of the notification chain.

Verizon validates enterprise cybersecurity maturity every two years through a third party maturity assessment.

This assessment measures Verizon’s ability to identify, prevent, detect, respond to and recover from threats to systems, assets and data.

The results of the assessment serve as the baseline for enterprise cybersecurity across the company.

In addition to this baseline, certain subsets of our technology environment are subject to incremental cybersecurity certification and periodic third party validation under applicable regulatory or contractual requirements.

Verizon’s Senior Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has responsibility for the management of cybersecurity risks at the company.

The CISO and her team are responsible for Verizon’s information security strategy, policy, standards, architecture and processes.

Verizon effectuates cybersecurity management by providing for close cooperation among the CISO’s team and other teams within the company, as well as by integrating cybersecurity risk into our overall enterprise risk management structures and processes.

Each of our business units and certain functional groups have a Business Information Security Officer, who is an integral member of that unit or group but reports to the CISO.

This structure provides the CISO with line of sight across the enterprise.

The Verizon Executive Security Council (VESC) oversees and evaluates the work of the CISO and her team.

The VESC provides oversight of all aspects of Verizon’s cybersecurity program and, at regular intervals throughout the year, evaluates key cybersecurity metrics as well as planned and ongoing initiatives to reduce cybersecurity risks.

Verizon’s Management Audit Committee (VMAC), which includes our Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President of Internal Audit and other senior executives, is responsible for overseeing components of our overall risk management strategy.

The VMAC receives quarterly updates from the CISO on Verizon’s cybersecurity program.

Verizon also operates a robust internal audit program.

Each year, Verizon’s internal audit team conducts an overall business risk assessment, which includes an evaluation of cybersecurity risks.

The results of the assessment are presented to the leaders of the relevant business teams, who are responsible for prioritizing and addressing the risks identified.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has primary responsibility for overseeing our risk management and compliance programs relating to cybersecurity and data privacy.

The CISO leads an annual review and discussion with the full Board dedicated to Verizon’s cybersecurity risks, threats and protections.

The CISO provides a mid year update to this annual review to the Audit Committee and, as warranted, additional updates throughout the year.

The Audit Committee also receives a report from senior management on Verizon’s cybersecurity posture and related matters at each of its other meetings during the year at which the CISO is not present.

We have implemented processes to identify and manage risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of third party suppliers.

Our Third Party Risk Management team establishes governance, processes and tools for managing various supplier related risks, including information security.

As a condition to working with Verizon, suppliers who access sensitive business or customer information are expected to meet certain information security requirements.

Verizon’s perspective on data security is based, in part, on our annual Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), a comprehensive study of data security incidents from around the world.

In 2023, the DBIR analyzed over 16,300 cybersecurity incidents.

This actionable intelligence helps companies large and small better understand the threat environment and plays an important role in shaping Verizon’s own cybersecurity efforts.

Verizon recognizes that protecting the privacy of customer, employee and business partner data is an essential part of operating and growing our business.

We have established measures to protect the privacy and security of the data entrusted to us and to support compliance with current and emerging international, federal and state data privacy legislation.

Our Chief Privacy Officer oversees this work and reviews data privacy risks and mitigating actions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors at least annually.

Verizon has adopted corporate policies and operating procedures governing the use, retention and protection of the data we collect.

Detailed information about Verizon’s privacy policies and practices can be found at our Privacy Center, which contains links to our Privacy Policy, supplemental policies for some of our apps and services and privacy policies maintained by our affiliated companies.

Our policies and procedures are subject to numerous controls.

We utilize internal audits and employee, contractor and supplier training to promote ongoing compliance.

Verizon has implemented a privacy governance framework to map privacy requirements to specific operational controls, which are assigned to appropriate owners.

As part of the framework, Verizon tests and monitors the controls and develops remediation plans where necessary.

Key employees include terms related to their ownership of controls in their annual performance agreements.

Verizon continuously monitors for legislative and regulatory developments and updates our policies and processes as needed.

We continue to advocate for a uniform federal privacy framework that would apply to all participants in the technology ecosystem.

We are committed to handling the personal information we collect from and about our customers, employees and business partners appropriately throughout every phase of the data life cycle, including collection, use, disclosure, retention and destruction.

We disclose our practices and have in place policies related to each phase.

We conduct privacy reviews when we develop and modify products, systems or other initiatives and purchase or sell assets.

Our privacy impact assessment process discussed on the next page provides a platform for formalized review of initiatives that involve the personal information entrusted to us.

We have also implemented a third party risk management process that identifies, assesses and mitigates risks throughout the life cycle of our engagement with suppliers.

We collect and use personal information as we describe in our publicly available privacy policies and in some cases, for business customers, in accordance with contractual requirements.

We seek to minimize the amount of personal information that we collect and retain, and we provide customers several ways to review and keep their account information up to date.

We provide customers with easy to understand privacy choices based on the sensitivity of the personal information and how it will be used or disclosed.

We have implemented specific controls around consumers’ most sensitive data.

We share personal information within Verizon and with suppliers, contractors and partners for a variety of purposes as described in our privacy policies.

We require suppliers and contractors that process personal information to use it only for the purpose for which it was provided or otherwise as permitted by law and to put in place data security measures that provide the same material protections as those we use at Verizon.

We enforce these requirements through binding contractual provisions that are put in place before personal information is shared.

Verizon 2023 ESG ReportApproachV TeamersOperational integrityEnvironmentCommunityAppendix     Data retention and destruction.

We maintain corporate policies governing data retention and destruction and review relevant practices as part of our privacy impact assessment process.

We retain personally identifiable records only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes.

We meet the requirements of our enterprise customers by contractually agreeing to custom data retention timelines and data destruction practices when needed.

Our employees are responsible for cooperating with and assisting business owners in fulfilling the obligations and requirements of our information security policy, as well as in complying with applicable laws.

We impose our information security requirements on suppliers who handle customer data, as well as additional privacy requirements on suppliers who handle international personal data.

Verizon’s annual Code of Conduct training, which is mandatory for all full and part time employees, has substantial privacy and information security content.

For targeted groups of employees, we supplement this general course with training on the handling of customer proprietary network information and other privacy and information security topics.

We provide periodic reminders and communications to employees highlighting information security and privacy issues.

Verizon also provides privacy and information security training to employees of third parties who have access to Verizon customer information.

We are focused on continued improvement of the quality, quantity and cadence of third party training.

Our wireless and wireline customers can use the Verizon Privacy Dashboard to request data access, correction or deletion.

Where provided by law, consumers have the right to appeal decisions.

Outside of the U.S., data subjects may ask to access or delete personal data consistent with local laws.

Customers and others can contact Verizon’s Privacy Office electronically and by postal mail.

Dedicated privacy team members review these inquiries and respond to questions related to our privacy practices around specific products, services or programs and help customers exercise their privacy and marketing choices.

We utilize a privacy impact assessment process to understand how a new product or system collects, uses, retains and shares data and to identify applicable legal, regulatory and policy requirements.

This process aligns in many respects with the policies outlined in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget’s Guidance for Implementing the Privacy Provisions of the E Government Act of 2002 (OMB M 03 22).

We also evaluate certain activities through a data protection assessment process designed to identify risks for certain types of activities that present heightened privacy impacts.

Customers and other individuals in the U.S. can obtain from Verizon the personal information that we have collected from or about them and may request that we correct or delete personal information.

We comply with applicable laws related to the privacy rights of minors, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

When Verizon operates online services covered by COPPA, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under age 13 without parental consent, except where such collection is expressly permitted under COPPA for purposes of internal operations.

We provide parents with information about their rights under COPPA, including instructions about how they can review information collected from children.

To consider and mitigate privacy, security and human rights issues from the earliest stages of new product development, we apply a privacy and security by design approach.

We take other appropriate steps to provide our customers with meaningful post launch privacy and security protections.

Verizon publishes semi annual reports that present the number of demands for customer information we receive from law enforcement in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business.

To learn more about how we handle these requests, see our most recent Transparency Report.

Verizon, like many companies, uses AI to improve our products, services and business operations.

We understand that poorly governed AI applications can result in unintended consequences, including potential bias or discrimination, whether in design, implementation or the data sets used to train AI models.

Verizon’s Artificial Intelligence and Data organization, together with our Data and Analytics Office, manages and implements Verizon’s centralized, enterprise wide Responsible AI Program.

Our Responsible AI Program is overseen by a dedicated team with support from other internal subject matter experts, including our Privacy team and Business Human Rights Program.

This program is governed by a risk based approach and informed by emerging global definitions, concerns, frameworks, regulations and legislation in AI and related fields.

We are guided by a set of foundational principles that provide direction to the many V Teamers using AI and align Verizon’s use of AI with the values of our Credo, as summarized in the table to the right.

While these principles do not represent the full breadth of AI issues, they are intended to inform common terminology for AI related efforts, guide our efforts to leverage new AI technologies in ways that positively impact our stakeholders and establish Verizon as a trusted brand and partner with respect to AI.

Verizon employs a risk based framework for developing, using and overseeing AI. We have processes to oversee Verizon’s development and use of AI, and our highly skilled employees have an important role to play in considering the risks, impacts and benefits of using AI.

Verizon recognizes that AI systems must incorporate a privacy by design approach, including consideration of the data used to train models and the data used to make business decisions.

Verizon’s use of AI must comply with our privacy policies and applicable laws.

We design and train Verizon systems using strategies to identify and reduce unfair bias and societal harm.

We address the risk of unlawful or unintended bias in AI systems with appropriate governance and mitigation measures.

Verizon uses industry accepted metrics to evaluate AI solutions’ ability to generate accurate, reliable and reasonably consistent outputs.

We employ a security by design approach, which proactively and holistically monitors for and mitigates against security threats.

Verizon understands that in order to provide reliable and positive user experiences, our use of AI systems requires transparency.

Verizon provides products and services that are accessible to the broadest range of customers.

We have a diverse team of accessibility professionals who are continuously working to make each customer’s experience the best it can be.

Our commitment to accessibility by design means that we are constantly working to incorporate the needs of people with disabilities into our initial design process of new products, services, digital information systems, web content, physical spaces and other facilities.

We collaborate with our Advocates for Disability, Accessibility, Neurodiversity and Caregiver Empowerment (ADVANCE) employee resource group, as well as industry partners, to remain informed about accessibility issues and to improve user experiences.

Verizon’s dedication to providing a digitally accessible experience begins with compliance.

To optimize the digital experience for all of our customers, we strive to meet or exceed the online accessibility standards recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium in its Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA).

For more information, see our Accessibility Resource Center.

Our services and tools are made for the way our customers communicate and include support like visual assistance, accessible content, auditory support and mobility tools.

Verizon also offers a suite of products designed specifically for children, which is featured on Verizon’s Family Tech hub.

We recognize that we have an important role to play in combating the use of the internet to exploit children.

As a leading provider of internet access services and cloud storage, we understand that the same tools that empower our customers to communicate with family and friends and safeguard their digital memories can also be misused to disseminate child sexual abuse material.

Verizon’s work to combat online child sexual abuse and exploitation begins with close partnerships with two organizations on the frontline of the fight: the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and the Technology Coalition.

Through our work with the coalition, Verizon has helped enable Project Protect, an ambitious and multifaceted plan to eradicate online child sexual exploitation and abuse through investments in technology, collective action, transparency and accountability, information and knowledge sharing and independent research.

The Responsible Business Council, Strategic Leadership Council and Board of Directors are regularly updated on our strategy for managing climate related risks and opportunities and our progress in meeting our climate related targets.

We have processes that allow us to proactively identify, assess and prepare for climate related risks.

We also continue to integrate climate risk variables into our overall risk management process and establish formal, cross functional processes that engage both our Board of Directors and management team.

Our annual enterprise wide climate related risk assessment asks senior leaders and subject matter experts to identify and evaluate the impact of climate related risk on our business, strategy and financial planning over short, medium and long time horizons.

We share the results of the assessment with senior leaders who have primary responsibility for addressing risks related to the operations within their purview.

Decisions on whether and how to prioritize, mitigate, accept or adapt to a particular identified climate risk are made at the business unit level and reviewed with the Executive Climate Oversight Committee.

We leverage information from third party sources, as well as lessons learned from severe weather and other natural events, to integrate climate related risks into planning for Verizon’s network operations.

We use geospatial analysis to evaluate the impact of climate related events, including storm surge from hurricanes, flooding, wildfire, high straight line wind and tornadoes on our current and future operational and network models.

This analysis highlights necessary investments to increase infrastructure resilience.

Verizon’s business strategy is centered around our world class networks.

Maximize the energy efficiency of our networks, facilities and fleet and transition to renewable energy where practicable.

Reduce waste and responsibly manage natural resources.

Develop solutions to help our customers transition to a low carbon economy.

Upgrade and harden our infrastructure to be prepared for a changing climate.

Verizon has published three TCFD reports since 2019.

Our most recent TCFD report was published in November 2023.

All of our TCFD reports are available on our ESG Resources Hub.

Even as our network grows, our emissions continue to decrease.

While Verizon has voluntarily disclosed the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with our operational energy consumption (scope 1 and 2) since 2004, 2019 was the first year for which we reported our value chain (scope 3) emissions.

As such, 2019 serves as the baseline year for our climate goals.

All direct sources of emissions owned or controlled by Verizon, with the main categories being fuel to power our fleet, heat our buildings and power our backup generators.

Indirect emissions from energy purchased by Verizon.

The largest category is electricity to power our networks and data centers, with a small amount of steam and heat purchased to heat our buildings.

Indirect emissions associated with Verizon’s upstream and downstream value chain.

The largest categories are purchased goods and services, capital goods, fuel and energy related activities (not included in scope 1 or 2) and use of sold products.

We obtain independent limited assurance of our scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions annually.

See the Independent Accountants’ Review Reports for more information.

Our 2023 data are being assured and will be reported later in 2024 on our Emissions reporting webpage.

Note: Numbers may not add up to totals due to rounding.

As we plan for a low carbon future, we are minimizing our environmental footprint through emissions and energy management across Verizon and our value chain.

To embed climate awareness across the enterprise, Verizon’s short term incentive plan for management employees includes a performance measure related to carbon intensity reduction.

We are reducing operational (scope 1 and 2) emissions by phasing out use of fossil fuels in our buildings and fleet, improving energy efficiency across our networks and facilities and transitioning to renewable energy.

We are tackling our value chain (scope 3) emissions through strategic supplier engagement and product life cycle management.

To address residual emissions that we are ultimately unable to abate, we plan to pursue carbon removal solutions.

Verizon’s Strategic Decarbonization Audit program is designed to identify and implement cost effective energy conservation initiatives across our real estate portfolio.

Each year, we select sites for the program based on criteria including on site fuel use, building age and size, overall energy performance and the impact of state and local building performance standards.

These sites undergo an extensive, year long audit, focusing on the electrification of HVAC systems, as well as solutions customized to the particular challenges present in many of our technical facilities.

The most impactful electrification, energy conservation and retro commissioning measures are then implemented over a one to two year project cycle.

We are taking a multifaceted approach to reducing our fleet emissions.

We have replaced aging bucket trucks, other than those outfitted for special uses, with trucks with hybrid drive systems.

These vehicles utilize a battery system to power the aerial lift, eliminating the need for the truck’s engine to be on to perform work on Verizon infrastructure.

We are pioneering technology to replace gas powered generators in fiber splicing vans with an electric battery system capable of powering equipment for days at a time.

In 2021, we conducted an engine calibration on nearly all of legacy Fios vans not yet at end of life to decrease the vehicles’ emissions without compromising their functional abilities.

We are also reducing fleet emissions by utilizing optimized vehicle dispatching technology to minimize the miles driven to service our networks.

The lack of electric vehicle (EV) models suitable for our commercial operations poses a challenge to our fleet electrification efforts.

While production of light duty EVs has been increasing to meet a variety of consumer uses, there are few if any EV options for the larger, specialized commercial vehicles on which our operations depend.

Despite these challenges, we are in the process of transforming our fleet from relying on internal combustion engines to using clean energy technologies.

We are planning to electrify a substantial portion of our customer facing fleet by replacing our oldest light duty vehicles with EVs.

We are purchasing these EVs at a rate aligned with available products and charging infrastructure suitable for our operations.

As EVs are introduced into our fleet, we are training impacted members of the V Team on the fundamentals of EVs, high voltage system safety and safe EV operation.

In addition, we are closely collaborating with manufacturers and actively participating in industry organizations to spur the manufacture of special use case commercial EVs in order to electrify our non customer facing light duty vehicles, as well as our medium and heavy duty operational vehicles, to the greatest extent practicable.

Effective energy management is not only necessary for the transition to a low carbon economy but also lowers operating costs now and into the future.

We are reducing energy use across our networks, data centers and building portfolio.

Verizon’s strategic focus on network modernization and decommissioning (i.e., powering down) of legacy equipment that no longer serves business or customer needs continues to result in significant energy savings.

As part of a wireline network transformation initiative, we have been discontinuing copper based services or migrating these services to fiber technologies, allowing us to decommission energy intensive switches and utilize our newer intelligent edge network platforms.

We shut down our 3G wireless network as of January 2023 and powered off all 3G wireless cell sites.

Powering down radios when they are not in active use.

Relocating heat generating network equipment from indoor locations to outdoor locations.

Auditing sites to understand where improvements are needed to meet our high standards of energy efficiency.

Partnering with suppliers to enable more energy efficient network equipment.

We are pursuing opportunities to transition our networks to clean energy sources.

For example, we are partnering with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to study the feasibility of solar power installation at remote off grid sites that rely on fuel powered generators.

To further maximize energy efficiency, we implement network cooling processes that reduce overall site energy usage and maintenance costs while extending the life expectancy of our equipment.

We optimize settings at our network facilities to reduce cooling system demand.

These adjustments are based on well established industry guidelines and have no detrimental effect on network performance or reliability.

We are deploying artificial intelligence (AI) solutions across a number of technical network facilities to enhance cooling system capacity and telecommunications equipment capabilities.

We are replacing and upgrading older cooling systems with newer, high efficiency systems that meet or exceed the latest industry energy efficiency standards.

These upgrades include systems equipped with free cooling economizers, which bring outside air into the HVAC system when it is cooler outside than inside, significantly reducing cooling energy consumption.

We design and operate our data centers for optimal energy efficiency.

Our data centers leverage the full range of environmental tolerances allowed by most server, storage and network hardware suppliers, enabling us to implement energy saving practices such as free cooling, waterside economizers, evaporative cooling, aisle containment and passive exhaust.

We also leverage the full limits of our power and cooling infrastructure by monitoring and managing the power demand profile at each layer of distribution.

In some locations, we use AI and machine learning algorithms to support energy conservation.

We continue to install energy efficient systems and employ energy management best practices at our buildings.

Facility improvements include mechanical and whole building control systems installation, LED lighting upgrades, high efficiency motor replacement, steam and water leakage reduction, on site solar deployment and HVAC system overhauls that replace aging equipment with heat pumps and adiabatic coolers.

We continue to deploy IoT sensor networks to more intelligently manage building controls, optimizing for set temperatures and equipment energy consumption.

Both domestically and globally, we are consolidating our real estate portfolio to more efficiently co locate people and equipment, thus eliminating unnecessary building emissions.

For example, we are currently moving a large technical facility in New York City into an existing office space.

The project is utilizing cutting edge energy technologies, including heat recovery chillers and submetering, which enables us to use meter level data to understand operational efficiency on a micro level (e.g., lighting, HVAC, telecom equipment, etc.

Verizon is proud to partner with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ENERGY STAR program by pursuing ENERGY STAR certification for 100% of our eligible facilities.

We have achieved 677 ENERGY STAR certifications for our properties since 2001.

For the 11th consecutive year, the EPA named Verizon an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year and again recognized us with a Sustained Excellence designation.

We are utilizing AI and machine learning capabilities to drive energy efficiency initiatives across Verizon.

Developing an algorithm to enable solar panel battery storage systems to discharge energy during peak periods when energy prices are highest.

Creating a model to identify cell sites with anomalous energy consumption.

Utilizing automation to reduce the number of truck rolls needed for.

Because most of our operational carbon footprint comes from the electricity that powers our networks, we have set targets to source renewable energy equivalent to 50% of our annual electricity usage by 2025 and 100% by 2030.

To demonstrate our commitment to the global transition to renewable energy, Verizon joined RE100 in 2023.

Our renewable energy purchase program is focused on supporting the transition to a greener U.S. electrical grid.

As our U.S network operations are located across the country and require a constant supply of electricity, we are dependent on sourcing power from the grid.

Today, much of that is brown power, produced from conventional fossil fuels, such as coal and oil.

Appendix long term renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) for solar and wind power under development.

The agreements provide the developers of renewable energy facilities with long term revenue certainty, enabling them to obtain the capital they need to construct new solar and wind energy facilities.

Our annual Green Bond Impact Report details the allocation of green bond proceeds and related impacts.

REPAs can help reduce Verizon’s long term exposure to energy price volatility.

Rather, the facility operator sells the energy into the wholesale market, and we typically receive the renewable energy credits (RECs) associated with the energy sold.

We retire these RECs against our actual electricity consumption to track our progress toward meeting our renewable energy targets.

Outside the U.S., we aim to procure most of our electricity from renewable sources and obtain guarantee of origin certificates from our utility providers.

We are developing on site green energy generation at our administrative offices and technical facilities.

Since 2013, we have installed 37.6 megawatts of on site green energy generation currently in operation at our facilities.

In addition to contributing to the achievement of our climate related goals, our on site solar installations are a powerful signal to our employees and communities of Verizon’s dedication to sustainability.

We continue to seek ways to integrate sustainability considerations into our corporate finance processes, including through capital raising, investor communications and impact reporting.

Verizon is one of the largest corporate green bond issuers in the U.S. Our green bond program is instrumental to our efforts to meet our interim renewable energy targets and long term operational net zero goal.

As of February 2024, we have issued a total of 6 billion of green bonds and have allocated approximately 5 billion of the net proceeds primarily to REPAs for new renewable energy projects.

Our Green Financing Framework articulates our sustainable finance strategy and explains how our intended use of proceeds and selection of projects supports our environmental goals and advances the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).

Most of Verizon’s emissions are generated by upstream activities outside of our direct operations.

While accelerating decarbonization throughout our value chain is one of our biggest challenges, it also creates an opportunity for us to collaborate with our business partners to build a more resilient and sustainable supply chain for our sector.

As part of the CDP Supply Chain program, we invited 318 of our key suppliers to join us in responding to the 2023 CDP Climate Change survey.

Through the CDP Science Based Targets Campaign, we are pressing high impact companies to commit to and set a science based emissions reduction target aligned with a 1.5 C scenario through the SBTi.

We have conducted a carbon maturity analysis of our key suppliers to identify where to focus our engagement efforts.

We encourage all of our key suppliers to set emissions reduction targets, which we track through disclosure and assessment platforms such as CDP and EcoVadis.

Standardized reporting and improved scope 3 data quality enable us to better understand the emissions from our value chain and ultimately manage them more effectively.

As part of our supplier engagement, we convey our expectation for accurate and complete emissions data and we encourage independent external review and assurance.

Industry collaboration is critical to reducing scope 3 emissions.

Within the telecommunications sector, we are partnering with the Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative and the Joint Alliance for CSR to develop scope 3 emissions reduction strategies.

We also participate in the MIT Climate Sustainability Consortium, an academia industry collaboration working to accelerate the implementation of climate solutions across sectors.

We are working to reduce supply chain emissions throughout the life cycle of our products and accessories from design to end of life.

Verizon maintains a teardown lab in which a team of engineers and cost modeling experts systematically deconstructs network equipment and devices to assess the efficacy and efficiency of their design.

The lab’s core objective is to offer insights on design optimization to enhance product sustainability from production to disposal.

To further reduce the emissions associated with our physical products, we are building out our internal life cycle assessment calculator.

Our Circular Supply Chain team partners with teams across the company to extend the useful life of devices and other network equipment through repurposing.

Verizon is one of the leading corporate buyers of renewable energy in the U.S. and a member of the Clean Energy Buyers Association.

As of February 2024, we had in place 27 long term REPAs for a total of approximately 3.6 gigawatts (GW) of anticipated renewable energy generating capacity.

As of such date, 15 projects related to our REPAs were in commercial operation.

We have contracted for approximately 1.8 GW of the generating capacity of these projects, which represents over 50% of the anticipated aggregate generating capacity of our REPA portfolio.

We are committed to minimizing our environmental impact and have implemented policies and programs designed to responsibly manage the natural resources we use and the waste we produce.

Verizon’s Environmental, Health and Safety Policy, endorsed by Verizon leadership, describes our commitment to protecting the environment and the health and safety of the V Team, the public and the communities where we operate.

Verizon’s Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) department is responsible for our EHS management system, which provides a framework for identifying, controlling and reducing the risks associated with our operations and reinforcing environmental stewardship.

Besides performing regular management system assessments, we also conduct internal and third party annual compliance audits and inspections at facilities worldwide.

These assessments aim to identify site specific issues and to educate and empower employees to take corrective actions.

Our EHS efforts are directed and sustained by experienced professionals who support our global operations and facilities.

Verizon’s EHS department maintains International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 (environmental) and ISO 45001 (occupational health and safety) certifications for our EHS management system.

Certification shows that our EHS department’s processes meet international best practices, drive continual improvement and create business value.

As water is a critical natural resource, we implement water conservation measures throughout our operations.

Verizon consumes the most water at our technical facilities, which require a controlled, cool environment for network equipment.

We manage water consumption in these facilities through cooling tower and cable dehydrator upgrades and maintenance.

Our continued implementation of energy efficiency measures in our technical buildings also helps to reduce water consumption.

We are further conserving water as we consolidate leased and owned buildings and adjust our HVAC systems in our administrative offices to reflect our adoption of a hybrid work environment.

We reduced our water usage by 16% from 2019 to 2022.

We obtain independent limited assurance of our annual water usage results at our administrative offices, retail stores, data centers, central offices, equipment, garage work centers, warehouses and motor vehicle maintenance centers.

Sites that do not routinely use water (e.g., network cabinets and huts, microwave equipment, towers and antennas) are excluded from the results.

For details, including our full calculation methodology, read the Independent Accountants’ Review Report.

Our 2023 water usage is currently undergoing independent limited assurance and will be reported in the Independent Accountants’ Review Report for 2023, which will be posted on our website later in 2024.

Verizon is committed to the sustainable sourcing and use of paper.

At least 50% of the paper we source annually will include at least 10% recovered fiber content and or at least 10% post consumer waste (PCW) content.

This excludes billing segments that are not able to be printed on recycled content paper because of machinery issues.

See our Paper Sourcing and Use Policy for more information.

Our EHS and Circular Supply Chain teams work internally across the company and externally with partners and suppliers to reduce, reuse and responsibly recycle materials.

We recycled or reused nearly 79 million pounds of materials, including e waste, in 2023.

Verizon defines electronic waste, or e waste, as electronic products and component parts that are at the end of their useful life and or have been returned by customers.

E waste generated by our business operations includes cell phones, chargers, set top boxes, network equipment, batteries and associated plastic components.

In 2023, Verizon reused or recycled nearly 47 million pounds of e waste, including 1.3 million pounds of plastic and 1.9 million pounds of lead acid batteries.

We strive to divert 100% of e waste from landfills by reusing or responsibly recycling materials.

To the extent practicable, we reuse electronic products and parts internally.

When internal reuse is not possible, we market these materials for reuse through approved partners or work with suppliers to responsibly recycle them.

Verizon’s Circular Supply Chain team partners with Corporate Sourcing to incorporate terms into our supplier contracts for the responsible end of life management of our products.

Many of Verizon’s recycling practices exceed regulatory mandates.

We engage e waste suppliers that manage our waste in accordance with high industry standards for environmental stewardship such as R2 and e Stewards.

Our practice is to require lead acid batteries from our U.S. operations to be sent to Verizon approved recycling facilities in the U.S. or Canada and to require our suppliers to provide certificates of recycling for the batteries.

We regularly audit facilities, including battery smelters, that manage Verizon’s hazardous or regulated waste.

Verizon’s device trade in program supports our circular economy approach to extending the lifespan of mobile devices and accessories.

The program enables both Verizon and non Verizon consumers to return qualifying, pre owned devices in exchange for a Verizon credit or gift card.

We repair, repurpose and resell these devices before pursuing responsible recycling at the end of their useful life.

We refurbish and redistribute our home internet devices for 4G and 5G fixed wireless access and Fios service to customers.

Consumers can also return obsolete devices for responsible recycling.

We are working to reduce the environmental impact of plastics in our products and product packaging, as well as in our day to day business operations.

Incorporating PCW, recycled plastic resin and ocean bound plastics in customer premise equipment, such as routers, set top boxes and remote controls.

Eliminating single use plastic packaging from our reverse logistics operations (i.e., product take back).

Products impacted by this change include home routers, optical network terminals and set top boxes.

Modifying our supply chain product requirements for all customer premise products to state that product packaging should be designed to eliminate or minimize the use of single use plastics and non recyclable materials and that products should be designed to use post consumer recycled content to the greatest extent possible.

Using responsibly sourced packaging materials for Verizon branded screen protectors.

Collaborating with teams across the company to develop new uses for the plastic harvested from old Verizon products.

For example, plastic from routers and set top boxes has been given new life as road signs, park benches and office chairs.

Eliminating single use plastics from our cafeteria and kitchen facilities at our corporate headquarters.

Reselling and or responsibly recycling surplus office furniture related to building renovations and sales.

Designing assets for large marketing events, such as trade shows, using repurposable materials that are more easily reused at future events or responsibly recycled at their end of life.

We believe that IoT technologies will be a major enabler of carbon reduction as we transition to a low carbon economy, and we are working in our 5G and innovation labs to develop new low carbon and climate resilient solutions for our customers and communities.

Verizon’s technology solutions are already achieving efficiencies not only in our own operations but also for our customers.

Our CEO chairs the World Economic Forum’s EDISON Alliance, which aims to mobilize industry sectors to quicken the pace of digital development and accelerate the opportunity for every person to participate in the digital economy.

Our CEO also serves as a member of the UN Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, driving progress toward achieving universal connectivity.

We are focused on expanding broadband access to a greater number of rural U.S. households.

The Investment in Infrastructure and Jobs Act (IIJA), passed by the U.S. Congress in late 2021, includes a historic investment of 65 billion to address these challenges and help states close the digital divide.

States and localities may also use American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds to help build out high speed internet infrastructure.

Verizon is reviewing available state and local subsidy programs and actively applying for funds to help bring our services to more locations where it makes sense for our network.

We have already been awarded substantial ARP funding to deploy new broadband infrastructure within our wireline footprint, with more proposals still pending, and we are looking carefully at where funding from the IIJA, once available, could help support additional deployment.

In addition to landline broadband service, we also offer fixed wireless access (FWA) through our 5G and 4G LTE wireless networks.

FWA broadband can provide more robust and affordable internet access than may otherwise be available to consumers in certain markets.

We continue to invest in our wireless network in rural and underserved U.S. markets, building new cell sites to provide additional coverage and expanding capacity on our existing cell sites to improve the performance of the network and our customers’ experience.

As part of our ongoing mission to help make dependable and high speed internet access affordable for all, we participate in the Lifeline program and will continue to participate in the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) if it is extended by Congress.

The Lifeline and ACP programs are federal programs overseen by the Federal Communications Commission that provide subsidized internet services for eligible low income customers.

In addition, we voluntarily provide discounts on Fios and fixed wireless services to low income families through our Verizon Forward Program.

Verizon also offers consumers a wide range of affordable, prepaid wireless services with 5G access and low cost device choices through our portfolio of brands, including TracFone, Straight Talk, Visible and Total by Verizon.

Consumers who qualify and are participating in the Lifeline program or the ACP can leverage their benefits to find zero cost prepaid service plans under our SafeLink brand.

SASB Standards, now managed by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation, enable companies to disclose consistent and decision useful ESG information to investors.

This index provides information with respect to the disclosure topics and accounting metrics in the SASB Standard for Telecommunications.

In the following tables, quantitative data is followed by narrative information that contextualizes the data where appropriate and is also responsive to any qualitative metrics.

The inclusion of information in this index should not be construed as a characterization regarding the materiality or financial impact of that information.

See our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and other publicly filed documents, which are available on our Investor Relations website.

Unless otherwise indicated, quantitative data is provided as of or for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, where available.

Where relevant, data measurement techniques, the bases of calculations and changes in the basis for reporting or reclassifications of previously reported data are noted.

On November 23, 2021, we completed the acquisition of TracFone Wireless, Inc. (TracFone).

Other than the metrics reported pursuant to TC TL 000.A, TC TL 000.C and TC TL 220a.2, the metrics reported herein exclude TracFone results.

Annually, Verizon obtains independent assurance of our emissions data and other select ESG indicators, including the metrics reported pursuant to TC TL 000.D and TC TL 130a.1 in this index.

Read the Independent Accountants’ Review Reports for more information.

For information that is not specifically identified as being independently assured, Verizon relies on the application of internal policies (including those requiring the creation and maintenance of accurate records and the establishment of internal controls over externally reported financial and non financial information) and compliance with data quality standards and verification procedures set forth in our ESG information governance and control frameworks to validate such information.

We will update this index to include the 2023 metrics that are currently undergoing independent assurance when the Independent Accountants’ Review Report with respect to those metrics has been issued.

Non financial information is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature of, and the methods used for determining, such data.

Some of our disclosures in this index are based on assumptions due to these inherent measurement uncertainties.

The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements.

The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary.

Wireless retail connections are retail customer device postpaid and prepaid connections as of the end of the period.

Retail connections under an account may include those from smartphones and basic phones (collectively, phones), postpaid and prepaid fixed wireless access (FWA), as well as tablets and other internet devices, wearables and retail IoT devices.

Total broadband connections are the total number of connections to the internet using Fios internet services, Digital Subscriber Line and postpaid, prepaid and IoT FWA as of the end of the period.

Percentage renewable electricity is calculated as total renewable electricity generated on site or purchased in the form of energy attribute certificates divided by total energy consumed.

See Data privacy for a discussion of Verizon’s corporate policies and operating procedures governing how we collect, use, retain and protect data.

The reported metric is 100% because, as described in the Verizon Privacy Policy, Verizon uses customer data to improve our products and services, which is one of the ways that the SASB Standard defines secondary purposes for purposes of this metric.

For purposes of reporting this metric, we have established a significance threshold that is lower than the materiality threshold for reporting legal proceedings in our SEC reports and will report any loss of 100 million or more, individually or in the aggregate.

The metrics include subpoenas, warrants and orders that we receive from federal, state and local law enforcement in the U.S., but do not include wiretap orders, pen register and trap and trace orders, national security demands and emergency requests, which we separately report in our Transparency Report.

A customer selector is an information point, such as a telephone number, used to identify a customer.

Verizon does not maintain a record of unique customers whose information was requested because multiple selectors may refer to the same customer (e.g., the same person may have multiple phone numbers) and selectors may be duplicated across requests (e.g., the same phone number requested in two subpoenas is counted as two selectors).

We define a disclosure as a full or partial disclosure of information in response to a request.

For more information on our processes and procedures for releasing customer information in response to law enforcement requests, see our Transparency Report.

Except as required by law, Verizon does not report this information.

For information about our approach to managing data security risks, see Cybersecurity.

Verizon defines e waste as electronic products and component parts that are at the end of their useful life and or have been returned by customers.

E waste generated by our business operations includes cell phones, chargers, set top boxes, network equipment, batteries and associated plastic components.

For more information on our e waste recycling and device trade in programs, see E waste: reducing, reusing and recycling.

For purposes of reporting this metric, we have established a significance threshold that is lower than the materiality threshold for reporting legal proceedings in our SEC reports and will report any loss of 100 million or more, individually or in the aggregate.

For information on Verizon’s global antitrust program, see Antitrust compliance.

Verizon does not measure download speeds on the bases specified in the standard (i.e., owned and commercially associated content versus non associated content).

We are committed to an open internet and have been at the forefront of innovation in the broadband ecosystem, advocating consistent policies aimed at creating a robust, level and dynamic playing field for all participants in the internet environment.

Verizon is an industry leader in operating resilient and reliable networks that support the needs of our customers.

Our networks in the U.S. include various design elements, technologies and business processes that work together to enhance the reliability of our services.

Verizon’s network design includes redundancy on critical paths and for critical network components to mitigate the impact of network events on customers.

We use forward looking risk assessments to plan and maintain our fiber backhaul configuration for critical network sites.

Such sites may contain traffic aggregation points, data centers or other technical facilities and typically have fiber backhaul deployed in a resilient ring or hub configuration, as well as dual diverse entrance facilities supporting our core infrastructure.

Verizon has also implemented a meshed core network architecture, which enables network equipment to switch traffic almost instantly across multiple available transmission paths between two endpoints.

When available, this enables the network to self recover promptly from outages to physical facilities (e.g., a fiber cut).

To minimize the impact of power disruptions at critical sites, we deploy reserve power in the form of batteries and or generators.

Our switching facilities are equipped with battery backup power and generators.

Macro sites have battery backup power as well, and the majority are equipped with generators.

In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed as needed.

To minimize the likelihood of congestion on our networks, Verizon proactively manages and augments network capacity based on defined thresholds associated with the expected voice, video, application and data traffic patterns across our network.

To help ensure appropriate network diversity and redundancy, we perform several internal audits per year.

Our engineering standards for strategic directional platforms require high availability equipment with auto failover capabilities to protect critical services.

Requirements for diversity and redundancy for critical paths and network sites are reviewed and addressed as part of network planning, engineering and operations activity.

Verizon designs its wireless network to provide for overlapping spectrum and coverage areas in many cases.

If a particular cell site goes offline, devices may switch to a different site and maintain connectivity.

Different spectrum bands deployed on our 4G and 5G networks can provide customers with additional options for connectivity and capacity if certain bands or nodes experience an increase in usage.

Most customer devices have the option to move seamlessly between our 4G and 5G networks and available Wi Fi networks to provide our customers with a high degree of reliability.

For more information on how we manage business continuity risk and the measures we have undertaken to make our networks more resilient, see Network resilience and our latest TCFD Report.

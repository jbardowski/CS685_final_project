From Our CEO

Morgan Stanley delivered strong financial results 
in 2022 against a complex and challenging 
macroeconomic backdrop.  

In 2022, we saw significant tightening of monetary policy to combat 
record-high inflation, a war in Europe, and continued geopolitical 
and political tensions—all of which led to volatile markets and the 
weakening of corporate confidence. Amid these uncertainties, the 
Firm proved resilient, with strong operating metrics, and we remained 
committed to helping our clients and communities. 

Our businesses have worked in tandem to embed environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) practices and product delivery for clients across 
the Firm. This report continues our approach to provide a transparent 
view of our ESG efforts, and illustrates the connectivity among our 
approaches to diversity and inclusion (D&I), climate and sustainability.

IN 2022: 

•   We strengthened our focus on improving diverse representation 

and belonging across our workforce. We also continued to address 
issues of inequity externally through initiatives such as the Equity in 
Education and Career Consortium, which is helping drive stronger 
career and earnings outcomes for students from low-income 
backgrounds.

•   I am proud that we have reached over $700Bn toward our goal to mobilize $1Tn in capital for sustainability solutions  

by 2030. This progress includes over $550Bn towards low-carbon and green solutions. Teams across the Firm contributed 
to this goal by delivering products that align with at least one of 12 eligible sustainability themes.

•   We also welcomed a second cohort of five visionary startups from around the world to the Sustainable Solutions 

Collaborative. This initiative aims to support concepts with the potential to provide breakthrough innovations by providing 
grants of $250,000 to participants to support their work.

At Morgan Stanley, our D&I, climate and sustainability efforts go hand in hand. We have made progress across our business, 
with our Firm’s culture guiding our activities. As we continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders, we remain 
focused on ESG objectives for our clients, employees and the communities in which we live and work.

Approach to ESG: Diversity and Inclusion, Climate 
and Sustainability at Morgan Stanley

Through the lens of our core values, our goal is to deliver best-in-class solutions across  
the full Morgan Stanley ecosystem. 

OUR INTEGRATED APPROACH TO ESG COMBINES THE CONSIDERATION OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION,  
CLIMATE AND SUSTAINABILITY: 

We aim to mobilize capital  
to support sustainable finance  
solutions with a focus on  
ESG matters.

As a part of our ESG efforts,  
we seek to make our global  
operations more sustainable,  
our workforce more diverse  
and our workplace  
more inclusive. 

Through the Morgan Stanley  
Institute for Sustainable Investing (ISI)  
and the Morgan Stanley Institute for 
Inclusion (IFI), we leverage our expertise, 
networks and resources to help drive 
adoption of more sustainable and 
inclusive practices across capital  
markets and communities in  
which we conduct  
business.

strategy here, our climate strategy here, and our

ESG Governance

We believe Morgan Stanley’s robust governance and business practices help foster 
client and stakeholder trust, and provide a foundation for success. ESG governance, 
encompassing our diversity and inclusion, climate, and sustainability efforts, starts  
with leadership from the top and is embedded in committees across the Firm. 

BOARD LEADERSHIP, ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENGAGEMENT 

Morgan Stanley board of directors (Board) committees 
have explicit oversight responsibilities for D&I, climate and 
sustainability. The Governance and Sustainability Committee, 
which was previously the Nominating and Governance 
Committee, has overseen ESG initiatives for several years.  
The Board Risk Committee oversees climate risks.  

The Compensation, Management, Development and 
Succession (CMDS) Committee assists the Board in its 
oversight of strategies, policies and practices related 
to human capital, including diversity and inclusion. The 
Audit Committee oversees the Firm’s voluntary public 
sustainability and climate disclosures. The full Board is 
briefed on topics across each theme, as appropriate.

In 2022, Morgan Stanley worked to enhance Firmwide  
ESG governance, by formalizing and standardizing the ESG 
organization structure (see ESG Governance Framework 
graphic on the prior page). We created or modified existing 
regional and business-unit-level committees to help ensure 
consistency in membership, structure and reporting lines. 
These ESG-related committees now report to the Firm ESG  
Committee, which oversees Firmwide ESG strategy, and to  
the Climate Risk Committee with respect to climate risk-related  
matters. In addition, ESG disclosure matters are reviewed 
by the ESG Disclosure Committee, with certain climate 
disclosures also reviewed by the Climate Risk Committee. 

CENTRALIZED TEAMS 

Global Sustainability Office: Led by our Chief Sustainability 
Officer and overseen by our Chief Administrative Officer, 
the Global Sustainability Office (GSO) drives the Firm’s 
sustainability strategy through thought leadership and 
innovation. GSO provides oversight of sustainability  
initiatives and works to ensure consistent integration of 
sustainability considerations across our corporate policies, 
business activities and operations. GSO partners closely  
with colleagues throughout our three business segments,  
as well as support services and risk and control functions.

GSO is organized across three areas of focus:

•   Global Sustainable Finance partners with Institutional 

Securities, Wealth Management and Investment 
Management to provide innovative ESG advice, products 
and solutions for our clients. As part of this effort, the 
Morgan Stanley Sustainable Insights Lab serves as an ESG 
data hub for the Firm, catalyzing data-driven solutions 
and quantitative analyses on sustainability topics. 

•   Firmwide Sustainability works to integrate ESG 

considerations across our business practices, operations 
and culture. This includes driving our Firmwide climate 
strategy, managing key Firm ESG disclosures, engaging 
with stakeholders and reducing the environmental impact 
of our operations. 

•   The Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing 
(ISI) helps accelerate the field of sustainable investing 
through thought leadership and capacity-building 
programs. The ISI is guided by an external advisory board 
that helps shape our ESG efforts both internally and 
externally.

Benefits and Wellbeing

At Morgan Stanley, the physical, mental and financial wellbeing of our global workforce 
and their families is paramount. 

Fostering Health and Wellbeing

Fostering a healthy and inclusive culture and supporting 
the positive physical, mental and financial wellbeing of our 
employees and their families is a priority of the Firm. Our 
global benefits strategy is informed by employee feedback, 
peer benchmarking and industry research. 

Our wellbeing strategy centers around three pillars:

wellbeing matters and engaging them to take charge  
of their health and wellbeing 

•   Prevention—a focus on mitigating health risk and 

promoting healthy lifestyles 

•   Access—providing best-in-class resources for our 

employees

We proactively support the physical, mental and financial 
wellbeing of our employees and their families through a 
robust set of benefits offerings. Our comprehensive programs 
include health care and insurance coverages, mental health 
resources, retirement plans, flexible spending and health 
savings accounts, and tuition assistance. We also support 
employees and their families through flexible work, family 
leave, child and elder care resources, and family-building 
support, including assisting with the cost of fertility, adoption 
and surrogacy services. On-site services at locations around 
the globe include health centers, mental health counseling, 
fitness centers and physical therapy.8 

Expanded Caregiver and Health Care Benefits 

To best help our employees support their families, the Firm 
introduced up to four weeks of paid family caregiver leave for 
employees9 to care for a family member with a serious health 
condition, and expanded parental leave to a minimum of  
16 weeks globally—in addition to up to six to eight weeks for  
any approved medical leave for employees who give birth. 

To increase accessibility to quality health care, we launched 
a U.S. partnership with One Medical, a primary care  
provider that reduces barriers to quality care like long wait 
times, inconvenient locations and poor patient experience. 

8   Resources vary by country.

9   U.S. employees who have been employed with the Firm for at least six months.

The Firm subsidizes memberships for One Medical’s in-person  
services and 24/7 virtual care for employees and dependents 
enrolled in our medical plan, with most virtual care delivered 
at no cost to employees. 

To help families navigate health care complexities, we also  
introduced Accolade Health Assistants—a team of benefits 
specialists, doctors and pharmacists who can help employees 
and their families navigate health issues and benefits. 

The Firm now covers the full cost of annual in-person medical 
exams for all employees in India. This new benefit also 
subsidizes health care for employees and their dependents  
and parents, and includes a home-delivery pharmacy  
service, as well as dental and vision care.

Focusing on Mental Health and Wellbeing

Delivering fast, easy and affordable access to quality 
mental health services is an important way to encourage 
self care. The Firm has implemented a number of strategies 
to enable that access. Our Global Wellbeing Board sponsors 
strategy and drives programming to help employees access 
mental health and wellbeing care. Our managers are also 
accountable for supporting employee mental health and 
wellbeing; employees are required to rate their managers’ 
ability to support and prioritize employee mental health and 
wellbeing as part of our annual performance evaluation 
process. Our Global Wellbeing Influencers are employee 
ambassadors who support colleagues by listening, 
advocating and sharing resources. 

CASE STUDY

GLOBAL WELLBEING 
INFLUENCER NETWORK 

In September 2022, we launched the Global 
Wellbeing Influencer Network, comprised of over 
250 employees who promote wellbeing in our 
workplace. Influencers help communicate our 
wellbeing strategy, raise employee awareness 
of mental wellbeing issues and offer support to 
their colleagues.

Influencers participate in a 12-month training 
program that includes mental health awareness, 
education on workplace resources, and the 
fundamentals and importance of exercise, 
nutrition, sleep and mindfulness. As grassroots 
ambassadors for our wellbeing program, they 
share their knowledge and experiences to 
support co-workers and connect them to internal 
and external resources.

Our Compensation Practices

The Firm’s business success depends on our ability to recruit and retain top talent.  

Pay Equity

Our compensation governance helps ensure equitable 
rewards for employees through:

•   Robust practices that support fair compensation and 

Compensation managers receive training to make decisions 
informed by employee performance dashboards and tools. 
Performance factors for these decisions include:

support merit-based reward decisions 

•  Employees’ absolute and relative contributions

•   Ongoing review of compensation decisions, including at 

•   Conduct and adherence to Morgan Stanley’s core values 

the points of hire, promotion and mobility

and other policies and procedures

•   Regular assessment of our rewards structure to ensure 

•   Performance feedback through the performance 

equitable treatment for employees

evaluation processes

Select regional policies prohibit the solicitation or use of 
previous compensation history at the point of hire, which 
helps minimize the risk of perpetuating pay inequities.  
We also conduct market analyses to help ensure that pay  
in each location, job level and function is competitive.

•   Market and competitive factors reflecting industry 

compensation trends and structures

Executive Compensation

Our compensation programs are designed to motivate 
appropriate employee behaviors, deliver pay for sustainable 
performance, align with shareholder interests, support the 
recruitment and retention of top talent, and be consistent 
with the Firm’s strategy and values and legal and regulatory 
requirements.

The Board’s Compensation, Management Development 
and Succession Committee (CMDS) follows procedures 
intended to ensure excellence in compensation governance. 
Members of senior management, together with the CMDS 
Committee, oversee policies and procedures for:

•  Compensation plan governance

•  Funding and allocating the incentive compensation pool

•   Use of discretion in determining individual incentive 

compensation awards

•  Identifying “material risk-taker” employees

•   Administering deferred compensation clawback  

and cancellation features

Each year, the Board and executive management team 
evaluate the Firm’s long-term strategic objectives and the 
Board approves financial and nonfinancial performance 
priorities for the Firm and its business segments. At the 
end of each year, the CMDS Committee assesses Firm 
and individual performance in achieving the performance 
priorities and determines incentive compensation for 
executive officers and other senior leaders based on its  
performance assessment. For the CEO, the CMDS 
Committee also discusses its performance assessment  
and incentive compensation determination with the Board. 

For 2022, the CMDS Committee reviewed performance 
priorities in the areas noted above. ESG-related 
performance priorities include culture, leadership, talent 
development and diversity progress.

to cancellation or clawback provisions. Employees who 
violate Firm policies may be subject to disciplinary action, 
including cancellation and clawback of compensation, 
reduction of bonuses, or termination of employment.

For 2022, 75% of our CEO’s incentive compensation was 
deferred over three years, subject to clawback; 60% of

 Supporting Communities Where We Live and Work

Giving back is deeply rooted in our culture. Morgan Stanley has actively supported 
communities around the world for more than 85 years.  

Morgan Stanley’s philanthropic efforts support communities 
financially and through employee engagement. The 
Morgan Stanley Foundation and Morgan Stanley 
International Foundation lead these efforts, bringing to  
life our core values of giving back and committing to D&I. 
In 2022, our Firm, foundations and employees collectively 
donated more than $160 million to nonprofit organizations 
around the world.

Our Focus on Supporting Children

Though we support a range of charitable causes, we focus 
on children's mental and physical health by addressing food 
insecurity, creating safe and accessible places to play, and 
helping kids grow and thrive. 

Amid the youth mental health crisis exacerbated by the 
pandemic and social inequity, the Morgan Stanley Alliance 
for Children’s Mental Health (Alliance) is actively addressing 
the critical challenges of stress, anxiety and depression 
in young people. The Alliance supports organizations 
through growth capital, nonprofit capacity building, seed 
funding and thought leadership. Launched in 2020, Alliance 
programs have reached 25 million students, families and 
educators globally, many of whom are from diverse and 
underserved groups.

In 2022, the Alliance launched its second annual Innovation 
Awards to identify and seed-fund transformative mental 
health care solutions for children across the United States. 
From more than 600 applicants, five grantees were 
selected based on their innovative solution: Closegap,  
The Confess Project, The Society for the Prevention of  
Teen Suicide, Strategies for Youth and Up2Us Sports.

Our thought leadership, research and events raise 
awareness on important matters, such as the benefits  
and drawbacks of children and family internet usage.

Employee Volunteering

We are committed to making a difference in the communities 
where our employees live and work. Our employees 
engage in the Firm’s philanthropic programs year-round by 
volunteering, donating funds and collaborating with their 
colleagues to increase our collective impact.  

2022 highlights include:

Global Volunteer Month: This annual cornerstone program 
brings our employees together to volunteer, and has 
provided nearly 2.6 million hours to local and international 
nonprofits since its inception in 2006. In 2022, over 41,600 
employees in 29 countries devoted over 211,000 hours to 
local organizations addressing hunger relief, environmental 
conservation, education and more. 

Strategy Challenge: This annual pro bono program in New 
York and London harnesses our employees’ professional 
skills and expertise to provide strategic advice to nonprofits 
serving the needs of underserved communities. Over eight 
to 10 weeks, cross-divisional teams help local organizations 
scale their missions. Team recommendations have led 
to more effective business models, expanded services 
and improved productivity. Since 2009, employees 
have delivered 131,000 hours of pro bono service to 
170 nonprofits, valued at $25 million.

 ~$166 million

Volunteer Month since 2006

25 million

reached by the Morgan Stanley Alliance for  
Children’s Mental Health since 2020

Volunteer Incentives: In 2022, we granted over $2.1 million 
in support to hundreds of nonprofit organizations where 
our employees serve as dedicated volunteers or governing 
board members. 

Giving: All Firm regions host charitable giving and matching 
programs for employees, increasing the impact of their 
donations to local and international organizations.

Nonprofit Partners: We form long-term partnerships around 
the world with local, national and international nonprofits, 
providing grants to help grow innovative programs and 
deepening our impact through employee volunteering. In 
the United States, our decade-plus partnership with Feeding 
America includes helping at food banks across the country, 
and we have served over 52,000 children in over 60 cities by 
building playgrounds and creative play sets with KABOOM! 

Disaster Response: In 2022, we hosted employee giving 
and matching campaigns in response to the humanitarian 
crisis stemming from the war in Ukraine and Hurricane Ian’s 
destruction in Florida. The Firm also donated funds to tackle 
the aftermath of heavy monsoon rainfall in Pakistan and 
damage from Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico.

Employee Networks

As a vital part of our culture, our employee networks drive  
engagement, cross-business connectivity and idea sharing. 
They empower colleagues to share their distinct experiences 
and perspectives, learn and develop professionally, support 
one another, and give back to their communities through 
philanthropic and volunteer efforts. Active engagement 
and dialogue with network members are also invaluable in 
helping to better understand the needs of diverse employees 
and broader diverse communities, and in shaping our overall 
diversity efforts.

CASE STUDY

EXPLORING IMPACTFUL RESEARCH WITH OUR ASIAN  
EMPLOYEE NETWORK

Members of our Asian Employee Network, as well as 
leaders from around the Firm, examined the findings 
of global DEI-focused think tank Coqual’s 2023 report: 
Strangers at Home: The Asian and Asian American 
Professional Experience. The report, which was co-
sponsored by Morgan Stanley, explores the unique 
challenges faced by the Asian and Asian American 
communities, and discusses the expansive diversity 
within the community.

Coqual’s Vice President of Research spoke with 
employees directly about the findings, followed by  
a panel discussion with Morgan Stanley leaders from 
the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. 
Roundtable discussions with employees were led by 
diversity professionals to review report findings and 
brainstorm ways the Firm can help ensure an inclusive 
workplace for all.

Leadership Statement

Through our commitment to 
Diversity and Inclusion, we  
continue to expand our inclusive 
culture, focus on our people and 
deliver innovative solutions to 
underserved communities.

At Morgan Stanley, our core values guide the Firm and our work. Through our commitment to Diversity and Inclusion, we 
continue to expand our inclusive culture, focus on our people and deliver innovative solutions to underserved communities.  
This report shows our ongoing commitment to transparency and accountability, and we are pleased to highlight the major 
strides taken across our business while maintaining our dedication to the work ahead.

Throughout 2022, we continued to deliver against our strategy to support, develop and advance our workforce, contribute  
to meaningful change in society, and invest in a more equitable and accessible marketplace:

•   Workforce: In 2021, the Firm set representation objectives to increase women officers by 25% globally, and Black and  

Hispanic officers by 50%. In 2022, we continued to make progress towards those objectives.

•   Society: Last fall, the Morgan Stanley Institute for Inclusion’s Equity in Education and Career Consortium launched  

Powering Potential Workshops in support of young adults from low-income backgrounds. Now in its second year, this  
program equips students with the skills for success with their personal finances, their careers and their wellbeing. 

•   Marketplace: Launched in 2022, the Firm’s Small Business Academy is aiding in the growth of diverse-owned small businesses.   

A partnership between our Supplier Diversity Program and the Institute for Inclusion, this effort empowers participants to 
leverage their competitive advantage, expand their knowledge and build strong business relationships with corporations. 

In 2022, we made a strategic decision to bring our Diversity and Inclusion, Talent Development, and Talent Acquisition teams 
together into a combined Global Talent Division. This integrated talent model positions us to better serve current and future 
employees, drive innovation and embed diversity into all talent practices. 

We are proud of our efforts, and will continue our work toward building a culture that supports workforce diversity  
and belonging.

In 2022, we continued to make significant investments, and the following section

communities, and has advised our internal D&I efforts.

Morgan Stanley Institute for Inclusion 

In June of 2020, we announced the launch of the Institute 
For Inclusion (IFI) to support investments in underserved 
communities and accelerate our own internal diversity 
efforts. The IFI brings our employees, communities and 
clients together in a shared commitment to creating a more 
equitable society.  

Our investment in high-impact opportunities, philanthropic 
investments in underserved communities and accountability 
to internal D&I commitments is exemplified through many of  
the IFI’s efforts. The IFI is led by an independent advisory 
board composed of prominent leaders in business, academia  
and nonprofit organizations, as well as Morgan Stanley 
Board members. The advisory board guides the work and 
strategic priorities of the IFI.

Built on the three pillars below, the IFI is a catalyst for our 
commercial, philanthropic and talent-focused efforts.

underserved communities through our products, services,

CAMPUS RECRUITING AND EARLY CAREER

Our diversity-focused campus offerings include our Early 
Insights programs, which introduce underrepresented high 
school seniors or college freshmen to financial services, and 
our HBCU Scholars Program, Richard B. Fisher Scholarship 
Program and Future Generation Scholarship, which 
provide financial support for students from underserved 
communities to offset the cost of their education. 

Our 2022 full-time campus hires hailed from more than  
400 colleges and universities—up from 350 in 2021— in 
over 50 countries, and include undergraduate and graduate 
majors in finance and accounting, science, technology, math 
and liberal arts. Of our global campus full-time hires, 47% 
were women, and of our full-time campus hires in the U.S., 
60% were ethnically diverse (compared to 48% and 54%, 
respectively, in 2021). 

SUPPORTING YOUNG TALENT THROUGH

through traditional avenues, such as undergraduate or 
graduate school. 

Apprentices at the Firm spend 80% of their time working in 
their dedicated department and 20% of their time studying 
and developing applicable skills at partner educational 
institutions. Upon completion of the program, participants 
receive qualifications equivalent to either a bachelor’s or 
master’s degree, and frequently accept full-time positions  
at Morgan Stanley. 

In 2022, apprentice hires at Morgan Stanley increased by 
31% year over year, with 54 program graduates joining 
teams in the United Kingdom (U.K.).

HIRING EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONALS 

Morgan Stanley’s Return to Work Program targets 
experienced professionals who have taken a career 
break for one year or more, and who want to return to the 
workforce. Currently available in nine locations globally,  
this 12-16 week paid program places participants in areas  
of the business that complement their skills and experience. 
Those who successfully complete the program are eligible 
to receive a full-time offer of employment. 

The Firm’s Experienced Professionals Program attracts high-
achieving professionals from a broad range of industries. 

The Firm leaders in Latin America support and foster the 
development of their employees locally, with support 
from the Morgan Stanley Institute for Inclusion.

EDUCATION

The Morgan Stanley Brazil office launched its first 
podcast series on diversity and inclusion topics to help 
educate employees. This effort has been met with 
enthusiasm and engagement, with the first series of 
episodes focusing on the impact of microaggressions  
in and out of the workplace.

PARTNERSHIPS

In 2023, Morgan Stanley Brazil established partnerships  
with nonprofit organizations GAUSS, which focuses on 
equipping diverse students for college, and Black Finance, 
which works to expose Black students to careers in  
financial services. Morgan Stanley's investment in both 
initiatives will impact 50 diverse young talents through  
these organizations.

EARLY CAREER

The Morgan Stanley Affirmative Summer Internship  
Program supports women and ethnically diverse students 
in Brazil. The five-week program, launched in 2019, 
allows students to gain training in soft and hard skills, and 
offers students the opportunity to meet with leaders and 
expand their network.

Those selected for the program are provided with a two-
year runway to learn about our sector, develop skills to 
thrive and build relationships across the bank. 

Our community partners, such as iRelaunch, the National 
Association for Black Accountants and the Association 
for Latino Professionals of America, help to support our 
experienced hiring efforts. In 2022, 41% of our experienced 
hires were women, compared to 40% in 2021, and 47%  
were ethnically diverse, holding steady from 47% in 2021.

Developing Underrepresented Talent 

INVESTING IN DIVERSE EMPLOYEES

The Institute for Inclusion’s Talent Accelerator’s Multicultural 
Leadership Program supports career advancement for 
underrepresented vice presidents and executive directors.  

Program elements include self-assessments, skill-building 
workshops, career guidance, one-on-one and small group 
coaching, opportunities to meet senior leaders, peer 
networking, and manager-specific programming to help 
support underrepresented employees.   

SPOTLIGHT

EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST  
AND AFRICA

EMEA’s 38-person Diversity Action Council 
is leading efforts to build a more diverse and 
inclusive workforce across the region. Through 
initiatives ranging from officer and campus  
hiring to inclusivity training and partnerships,  
the council works to help ensure an equitable  
and welcoming workplace for all.

SUPPORTING OUR TALENT 

Morgan Stanley was an early signatory to both the U.K. 
Women in Finance Charter and U.K. Race at Work Charter, 
which are efforts to increase representation of women 
in senior management and representation of ethnically 
diverse employees at the officer level. After committing to 
30% senior roles occupied by women, we are proud to have 
47% gender diversity on the Morgan Stanley International 
Board and 44% on the EMEA Operating Committee. 

In the last six years, we have made progress on narrowing 
our gender pay gap to 27.6% Median Hourly Pay Gap 
in 2022, a 7.6 percentage point decrease from our first 
report in 2017. We have leveraged a 5-point action plan to 
maintain focus to ensure long-term success through our 
recruiting efforts as well as a critical focus on the retention 
and development of our senior female talent pipeline with 
robust talent development offerings and a suite of family-
friendly benefits. Gender pay gap is a measure of the 
average pay difference between women and men across 

an organization regardless of role or level. This is different 
from gender pay equity, which measures whether women  
and men are paid equally for the same or similar roles, or 
for work of equal value.  

In 2022, we expanded our efforts to attract, support and 
develop diverse talent, which we view as critical to our  
business success, by:

•   Partnering with leading organizations driving local 
change, including the 30% Club, 10k Black Interns, 
Business in the Community, Black Young Professionals 
and Black Professionals of Scotland. 

•   Investing in our leadership pipeline through talent 

programs that support our people at each stage of their 
career journey. 

Training leaders to create a more inclusive workplace is  
critical to cultivating our people and culture. To mitigate 
bias, we launched new training in 2022 for all managers in 
EMEA. The comprehensive Inclusive Leadership Curriculum 
is designed to ensure more equitable people processes  
in hiring, employee experience and business operations. 
This latest initiative follows our two-year mandatory 
Let’s Talk About Race workshop training, completed by  
all employees in the region.

INCREASING REPRESENTATION

In addition to the Firm’s representation objectives globally 
and in the U.S., we have established objectives for the 
U.K. Currently, we are working toward increasing senior 
management representation for women to 35%, U.K. ethnic 
minority officers to 30%, and U.K. Black officers by 40%.

INVESTING IN WOMEN

The Institute for Inclusion Talent Accelerator Women’s 
Leadership Program for Executive Directors and Vice 
Presidents is designed to help women officers grow their 
careers at the Firm through targeted skill development, 
career guidance, one-on-one coaching and opportunities 
to engage with and learn from senior leaders. Program 
elements mirror those in our Multicultural Leadership 
Program. Originally launched in North America, the  
program expanded to Europe and Asia in 2022.

In Europe and Asia, our Platinum Program offers a highly 
customized, six- to eight-month development program  
for women Executive Directors. Programs are tailored  
in each region, but generally include leadership 
assessment, professional coaching and leadership 
development workshop.

SPOTLIGHT

ASIA PACIFIC AND JAPAN

Our leaders in Asia Pacific and Japan foster a culture 
of respect and accountability that supports a high-
performing, healthy workplace for our colleagues.

A MULTIGENERATIONAL WORKPLACE 

Our workforce spans four generations, providing 
us with the unique opportunity to leverage each 
generation’s strengths to create a more inclusive and 
productive workplace, and to address attrition trends 
among junior staff felt throughout the industry.

Across Asia Pacific and Japan, around 700 employees 
and managers participated in two events with 
generational expert and New York Times best-selling 
author Lindsey Pollak. Her presentations focused 
on methodologies and strategies for leading and 
succeeding in a multigenerational workforce.

OUR WOMEN TALENT PIPELINE

To help enable Morgan Stanley’s representation 
objective to increase women officers at the Firm  
by 25%, and to better understand the personal  
and organizational obstacles impacting our  
female leadership pipeline, we:

•   Conducted wide-ranging and candid discussions 
with regional heads on how best to develop and 
progress our women talent pipeline.

•   Held confidential, one-on-one “Stay Conversations” 

with women executive directors to identify  
personal and organizational barriers to  
progression and provide insights for the future.

To support employees planning for parenthood,  
we released guidebooks for expecting employees  
and their managers to help navigate and support  
their transitions. Coaching is also available to  
help employees transition between parental  
leave and work.

SOCIETY

Driving Gender and Racial Equity  
Through Philanthropy 

We support underserved communities through intentional investments, philanthropy  
and enrichment programs that seek to address inequities in education, careers, economic 
opportunity and health. Our efforts to promote equity and inclusion beyond our own 
workplace are led by the Institute for Inclusion, the Morgan Stanley Foundation and the ISI. 

Equity in Education and Career Consortium

The Morgan Stanley Equity in Education and Career Consortium  
(EECC), housed under the IFI, is a collaborative effort with the 
Morgan Stanley Foundation and community partners. Now in 
its second year, this effort helps address systemic inequities 
for young adults from low-income backgrounds. 

Our consortium partners have proven track records and a  
high standard of excellence in serving high school and college 
students in their journey to establishing successful careers  
and stronger financial futures. These partners include: 

•  A Better Chance (ABC) 

•  CUNY ASAP 

•  America Needs You (ANY) 

•  Hispanic Federation

SPOTLIGHT

•  Braven 

•  College Possible 

•  iMentor 

•  SEO

Our work with these organizations is intended to expose 
students to new career paths and opportunities; broaden their 
skills and networks through training, mentorship and coaching; 
and create a support system for their educational and career 
journeys. In 2022, over 2,000 employees participated in 
sessions about the EECC during Global Volunteer Month, and 
500 employees were recruited as volunteers or mentors.

POWERING POTENTIAL 

In the fall of 2022, the EECC launched Powering Potential 
Workshops for students from consortium partner  
organizations. Participants learned how to build a foundation  
for sustainable financial wellness, explored careers in  
financial services and developed strategies to prioritize 
wellbeing on the pathway to career and economic mobility.  
The second iteration, held in the spring of 2023, included 
sessions on college financing, exposure to careers at 
Morgan Stanley and techniques for managing stress and 
anxiety. This year, we will expand the Powering Potential 
Workshops to include offerings for high school students.

SUPPORTING THE LGBT+ 
COMMUNITY

Morgan Stanley has a long-standing commitment to the 
LGBT+ community around the world. The Firm consistently 
offers steadfast support in many ways, from being a leader 
in the fight for marriage equality in the U.S. to joining 
the EU Diversity Charter to support diverse and inclusive 
workplaces. In 2022, the Firm received a score of 100 on 
the Human Rights Campaign’s (HRC) Corporate Equality 
Index, and joined peer financial institutions in signing  
on to HRC’s Respect for Marriage Act Corporate  
Sign-On Letter. 

Our Pride and Ally employee network focuses on delivering 
groundbreaking programming globally to our employees, 
clients and prospects. In addition, Morgan Stanley proudly 
supports vital community partners working to drive  
LGBT+ equality, including: The New York LGBT Center, 
PFLAG NYC, and the Transgender Legal Defense & 
Education Fund.

THE MORGAN STANLEY HBCU 
SCHOLARS PROGRAM

Launched in 2021 and supported by the IFI, our 
HBCU Scholars Program provides academic and 
needs-based four-year scholarships for students 
at Howard University, Morehouse College and 
Spelman College, historically Black colleges and 
universities (HBCUs) in the United States. The Firm 
began the program by providing five academic 
and needs-based four-year scholarships at each 
institution, adding a new class of scholars each year 
for a class size of 60 by 2024. These scholarships 
cover the entire cost of attending college for each 
academic year and are open to students across 
all disciplines and majors. In addition to financial 
support, the Firm implemented a board of advisors 
for each Scholar, composed of a mentor, a sponsor 
and an HBCU ambassador. Scholars retain their 
advisors throughout their college years. 

Scholars interested in financial services will be 
introduced to careers at Morgan Stanley through 
our campus career offerings, and Scholars 
interested in other careers are connected with 
Morgan Stanley employees similar with career 
backgrounds or networks outside the Firm. 

HBCU Day 2022

Morgan Stanley welcomed 30 Scholars from the first 
and second cohorts of the program to New York City in 
September 2022 to engage with senior leaders and 
learn about our business. 

During a day spent at our Firm headquarters, the Scholars 
heard directly from Chairman and CEO James Gorman, 
Chief Human Resources Officer Mandell Crawley and 
Global Head of Talent Susan Reid. Scholars tuned in to 
panels featuring Morgan Stanley employees who are  
HBCU alumni, who discussed their paths from college to  
a career in financial services.

“ I wouldn’t be at Spelman College 
or any college at all without 
this scholarship. I hope to take 
advantage of this opportunity to 
grow as a student and create a 
life that I’ve never seen anyone 
around me live.”

MARKETPLACE

Investing To Advance Economic Outcomes  
for Underserved Communities 

To help underserved communities thrive, we partner with organizations, small 
businesses and suppliers to help address gaps in funding and access for diverse 
businesses. Our Firm’s investments in diverse startups and entrepreneurs can  
be found in the Solutions and Services section.

Supplier Diversity

Our Supplier Diversity Program seeks out diverse-led 
businesses, including those owned by ethnically diverse 
individuals, women, veterans, people with disabilities and 
members of the LGBT+ community to supply hundreds 
of our offices worldwide. This diverse vendor base helps 
provide opportunities to underrepresented business owners 
and to support the communities where we operate. 

Supplier diversity guiding principles support the continued 
broadening of our supplier pool. With these practices, 
we train our sourcing professionals; maintain a supplier 
database with vendor diversity certifications;  and include 
specific supplier diversity language in both our Global 
Procedures for Supplier Selection and Engagement 
and Supplier Code of Conduct. We review our diverse 
supplier engagements quarterly and annually to identify 
opportunities to expand both the number of diverse 
suppliers and the spend with them. To reinforce sourcing 
excellence in this area, we award Supplier Diversity 
Champions annually, an accolade recognizing those who 
significantly exceed expectations as measured against our 
guiding principles for supplier diversity.  

We are proud to partner with the following organizations in 
our supplier diversity efforts:

•   Minority Supplier 
Development U.K. 

•   National Gay and Lesbian 
Chamber of Commerce 

•   National Minority Supplier 

Development Council 

•   National Veteran-Owned

Small Business Academy 

Barriers and resource constraints often prevent small  
businesses from gaining a foothold in the marketplace,  
causing a gap between available opportunities and diverse 
suppliers. In partnership with the Institute for Inclusion, the  
Small Business Academy helps bridge this gap by equipping 
entrepreneurs with the expertise they need to win business  
with financial services firms and other sectors.

Launched in 2022, the Academy empowers diverse-owned  
small-business leaders through education, sharing of best  
practices and mentorship. The Academy, a partnership  
between our Supplier Diversity Program and the Institute for 
Inclusion, helps diverse-owned U.S. and U.K. small businesses 
stand out in the procurement process, strengthen their 
business knowledge and build their professional network. 
The 12-week virtual, instructor-facilitated program includes 
interactive workshops, coaching sessions and a capstone 
project. Graduate firms receive 12 months of ongoing  
support from a Morgan Stanley mentor and the opportunity  
to access grants to fuel their growth. Ten diverse-owned 
small businesses participated in our first cohort.

Highlights Across Our Business 

Each of the areas of our business drives D&I initiatives within their areas of focus. Several examples are featured below. 

INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES

TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS

JumpStart Scholars in Finance: The Morgan Stanley 
JumpStart Scholars, a partnership with Leadership, 
Education and Development (LEAD) in Finance initiative, 
provides financial access, programming and mentoring 
for diverse high school students throughout the United 
States. The five-month program offers an eight-course 
curriculum to broaden participants’ career opportunities 
and encourage proactive financial planning. Analysts and 
associates across Institutional Securities engage directly  
with student participants. The program culminates in a 
capstone competition where scholar teams re-create a  
deal scenario from our Global Capital Markets division.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

Women’s Mentoring Circles: Focusing on the development 
of women vice presidents, senior associates, associates 
and analysts within our Investment Management business, 
Women’s Mentoring Circles provide the support and space 
needed to discuss topics relevant and important to women 
in the financial services industry. This six-month program 
covers topics including Authentic and Inclusive Leadership, 
Career Advancement, and Personal Branding, with each 
circle consisting of five mentees and two mentors at the 
executive director level.

Project Elevate: In partnership with PeopleShores, a public 
benefit company empowering underserved communities in 
the U.S. with digital skills and corporate job opportunities, 
Project Elevate is working to educate, employ and empower 
experienced diverse talent. The program provides 
participants with six-months of training and a one-year 
consultancy, with Morgan Stanley having the opportunity to 
convert participants into full-time employees upon program 
completion. This program engages a pipeline of talent from  
a range of educational, ethnic and social backgrounds. 

WEALTH MANAGEMENT

The Equity Collective: In February of 2022, Morgan Stanley 
launched the Equity Collective (the EQC), a group of Wealth 
and Asset Management firms that have committed to 
educating, empowering and developing the next generation 
of diverse leaders in the finance industry.

The EQC has led more than 100 events, engaging with 
students through partners at Boys & Girls Clubs of America, 
hellohive and Team IMPACT. The EQC supported the rewrite 
of Boys & Girls Clubs of America’s Career Launch curriculum, 
the organization’s premier job-readiness and career 
preparation program for teens ages 13-18. In collaboration 
with hellohive, a virtual recruiting platform focused on 
diverse talent, the EQC hosted an immersive virtual program 
for over 500 students from more than 150 colleges, offering 
students access to internships and job openings from 
participating firms. The EQC worked with Team IMPACT to 
build relationships with universities and colleges across 
the country, allowing Team IMPACT to continue to match 
children facing serious illnesses and disability with college 
sports teams.

Leadership Statement

As Chief Sustainability Officer and CEO 
of the Institute for Sustainable Investing, 
I am proud of Morgan Stanley’s ambition 
to reach net-zero financed emissions  
by 2050.

We were the first major U.S. bank to make this commitment, and we built on it in  
2021 by announcing interim 2030 financed emissions reductions targets for energy, 
power and auto manufacturing. We are also committed to mobilizing $750 billion to 
support low-carbon and green solutions by 2030.

To achieve these goals, we recognize how important it is to operationalize our 
commitments in a way that balances the need to rapidly decarbonize the global 
economy with the real-world circumstances acutely affecting individuals and 
communities. That is why we consider climate as part of our overall business  
strategy and approach to risk management. 

It is also why I co-chair Morgan Stanley’s Climate Risk Committee, which is focused  
on overseeing climate risk considerations throughout Firm processes. Morgan Stanley 
is in a unique position to support the climate transition and, looking to the future,  
I am excited to continue to work with clients and colleagues to meet our 
commitments in support of a fair and just transition.

Morgan Stanley is committed to considering climate change throughout our business, 
operational and risk management activities. To support this work, we have a four-pillar 
climate strategy, with the overall goal of achieving net-zero financed emissions15 by 2050. 

We seek to support the transition to a low-carbon economy 
with a public commitment set in 2021 to mobilize $750 
billion in capital toward low-carbon and green solutions 
by 2030. We manage climate risk by integrating climate 
change considerations across risk management processes 
and governance structures. In our operations, we strive to 

minimize our emissions footprint and enhance our climate 
resiliency. The strength of our commitment is demonstrated 
by our achievement of carbon neutrality across our global 
operations in 2022. We are committed to transparency and 
communicate our efforts and resulting progress through  
our climate-related disclosures.

Our Approach to the Net-Zero Transition 
Morgan Stanley is committed to achieving net-zero financed emissions by 2050 and contributing to the 
decarbonization of the real economy. 

Effective action on climate change requires a broad 
transformation across sectors and economies, and 
management of impacts to workers and communities.  
We also recognize the need to balance the urgency of the 
calls to action with the realities of the social, economic 
and geopolitical landscape, and see that our clients are 
balancing the same concerns.

We recognize that our path to achieving net-zero financed 
emissions from our lending activities, including our interim 
2030 targets for the Auto Manufacturing, Energy and  
Power sectors, will not be a straight line. 

Our clients are at different stages of setting their own 
targets, developing plans to diversify and, in some cases, 
transform their business models. While we understand the 
need to reduce emissions quickly, we are also aware of  
the unintended consequences of withdrawing capital  
from transitioning sectors. We support an orderly transition 
and therefore accept that, in some cases, lending to 
companies that are transitioning may result in our  
financed emissions increasing in the short term or over 
certain periods. However, we believe that this support  
will ultimately facilitate the transition to a sustainable  
and lower carbon future. 

Our approach to meeting our climate commitments is 
described below. As we continue to develop this approach, 
we will utilize frameworks including the Glasgow Alliance 
for Net-Zero (GFANZ) transition planning guidance to help 
inform our approach. Please see “Climate Strategy: Looking 
Ahead” and “Approach to Transition Index” for more detail.

low-carbon solutions that reduce our clients’ greenhouse 
gas (GHG) footprints, we expect to reduce our own financed 
emissions and make further headway toward our targets. 
Our work with clients to scale low-carbon opportunities is a 
key component of our commitment to mobilize $750 billion 
to support low-carbon and green solutions by 2030.

2  Support Our Clients Through  
Climate Transitions 

Morgan Stanley aims to meet our climate commitments 
and contribute to real-economy decarbonization by 
supporting our clients in achieving their own climate-related 
commitments. Many of our clients will require capital and 
expertise to achieve their targets and ensure their business 
strategies are resilient in a decarbonizing economy. Our 
clients also face complexities as they transition, and 
Morgan Stanley is committed to working with them at all 
stages of their climate journeys.

We seek to work closely with our clients to understand and 
assess their low-carbon transition plans, the resourcing of 
their plans and how these plans align with our own climate-
related commitments. Educating our own bankers is also 
a critical part of this strategy. In 2022, we hosted ESG 
training sessions for relevant banking and capital markets 
employees on environmental and social commitments and 
policies, as well as the related due diligence and governance 
processes. We will continue to provide guidance going 
forward to educate and equip our client-facing teams with 
the knowledge to make climate-informed decisions.

CLIMATE STRATEGY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

In 2022, we began to develop a new Climate Strategy 
Assessment Framework (CSAF) that provides additional 
insight into our clients’ approaches to climate. 

The CSAF will leverage data from public sources and client  
discussions to help us understand our clients’ transition plans  
and climate commitments. It will help us assess company 
targets, climate governance, plans and actions taken toward 
meeting targets, and GHG emissions performance.

The framework will inform client diligence practices and will 
also help us focus on our client engagement discussions. 
There will be an initial focus on companies in the sectors 
covered by our interim 2030 targets, with an aim to cover 
more companies over time as we announce additional 
sector targets. This new tool will deepen our understanding 
of clients’ climate plans and help us assess the robustness 
of our clients’ commitments and the resources they are 
dedicating to the transition. As data improves over time, and 
as publishing transition plans become more widely adopted, 
we expect this information will help enhance our analysis 
framework and process.

3  Manage Our Lending Portfolio

We understand that over time there may be clients who 
cannot transition in a timely manner. We also recognize that 
there may be a period of time, while our clients plan and 
implement their strategies, before we are able to see GHG 
emissions reductions. However, our engagement approach 
with clients as they transition is not indefinite. We intend to 
increase focus on how portfolio lending decisions affect 
the progress toward our targets, and we take that into 
account as we drive our strategy. We will continue to work 
with our clients on their transition strategies and consider 
their approaches to climate as we make portfolio lending 
decisions to meet our 2030 interim net-zero targets.

Monitoring Progress 

We have rolled out the following review processes to monitor 
progress toward 2030 interim net-zero targets. We will 
continue to review and modify our approach as needed:

•   Business Unit Reviews for our interim target sectors, 

which evaluate new lending opportunities through the lens 
of the impact on progress toward our targets, taking into 
account annual client emissions.

•   The Climate Risk Committee (CRC) and Emissions 

Oversight Committee (EOC) will conduct regular reviews 
of the Firm’s progress toward meeting our interim targets.

Measure, Manage, Report: Our Framework 
for Net-Zero Financed Emissions

In September 2020, Morgan Stanley became the first  
major U.S.-headquartered global financial services firm to 
commit to achieving net-zero financed emissions by 2050. 
In November 2021, we announced 2030 interim financed 
emissions targets to guide our lending activities based on 
credible science-aligned emission pathways. These targets 
focus on emissions-intensive sectors in our corporate  
lending portfolio—Auto Manufacturing, Energy and Power.  
In July 2022, we published our 2019 baseline GHG emissions 
from lending activities for each interim target sector.  
Together, both developments mark an important start toward 
our 2050 commitment to net-zero financed emissions.

Morgan Stanley is currently the only major U.S.-headquartered 
global financial services firm on the Partnership for Carbon 
Accounting Financials (PCAF) Steering Committee, and is  
both a founding member and a member of the steering group 
of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). The frameworks  
and methodologies of these two expert organizations help 
inform our thinking around setting climate-related targets  
and measuring our progress.

We value our leadership in these initiatives that help inform 
our approach to net-zero and we continue to make our  
own independent decisions regarding our climate strategy.

OUR APPROACH TO CARBON OFFSETS TO ACHIEVE  
NET-ZERO FINANCED EMISSIONS 

High-quality offsets can help address hard-to-abate 
emissions that cannot first be mitigated by existing 
technologies or operational changes. We believe carbon 
offsets will play a critical role in helping the real economy 
achieve net-zero emissions, particularly in the near term, 
as new decarbonization technologies develop sufficient 
maturity and scale. 

Morgan Stanley acknowledges that the growing yet nascent 
voluntary carbon market continues to offer opportunities 
for real economy participants to offset emissions they 
are responsible for. As we work with clients who seek to 
reduce their emissions footprint, understanding the quality 
of client-procured offsets, as well as their usage compared 
to achieving real, underlying emissions reductions, will be 
points of consideration. Morgan Stanley will not buy offsets 
to directly reduce our financed emissions. For our approach 
on offsets relating to achieving our own operational carbon 
neutrality, please see here.

EDUCATING EMPLOYEES  
ON CLIMATE 

Given our commitment to supporting the low-
carbon transition, it is important to equip our 
employees with resources and education on how 
climate change impacts the Firm and our clients 
from a business perspective.

We created an in-house platform for staff to learn 
the information necessary to make well-informed, 
climate-related business decisions in a rapidly 
shifting global landscape. The online platform 
provides a suite of trainings, tools and resources, 
including a core curriculum that focuses on climate 
change fundamentals, risks and opportunities.

These learning modules are complemented by 
a speaker series in which experts from inside 
and beyond the Firm provide relevant and timely 
insights on topics ranging from climate policy to 
technological solutions. Recent examples include 
a webinar on the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act from 
the president of the Center for Climate and Energy 
Solutions (C2ES) and an overview of the carbon 
markets from the Morgan Stanley commodities 
desk. Our Global Sustainability Office also 
distributes a regular brief on climate news and 
topics to help ensure employees are up to date 
with the latest developments.

Informing Climate Policy
Morgan Stanley supports the Paris Agreement and recognizes the importance of global policy action to 
achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. 

As a financial firm with global reach, we recognize that we  
have a role to play in engaging with national and global 
climate policies that support an orderly transition to a low-
carbon economy. We support science-aligned and, where 
possible, market-based policies, including a price on carbon, 
and engage with policymakers, industry groups and trade 
associations to promote effective global and national  
climate policies.

Further policy will be required to help achieve net-zero by 
2050, and help mobilize the capital required to get there. 

Trade Associations and Industry Groups 

We work with our leading trade associations to promote 
positions that support common sense and cost-effective 
climate policy. These associations include the Securities 
Industry and Financial Markets Association, the Financial 
Services Forum, the American Bankers Association, the Bank 
Policy Institute and the Institute of International Finance, 
among others. A list of the principal U.S. trade associations  
of which Morgan Stanley is a member can be found here. 

Our participation in trade associations helps further 
Morgan Stanley’s work as a global financial services firm; 
however, it does not imply that we always align with their 
positions on all aspects of climate policy. We provide our 
independent view as members and seek alignment where 
feasible and appropriate.

In addition, we seek to actively participate as a member of 
various climate-focused working groups. For example, we are 
part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Climate Action Task 
Force, as well as the Climate Solutions Working Group, an 
external group composed of Chamber members who want to 
see the Chamber more proactively support decarbonization 
policies. As part of these activities, we engage with the 
Chamber in constructive dialogue to share our perspective.

The climate-focused trade organization working groups of 
which we are a member are listed below.

Engaging With Policymakers 

Morgan Stanley is a member of the Center for Climate 
and Energy Solutions’ Business Environmental Leadership 
Council—the largest U.S.-based group of corporations 
focused on addressing climate challenges and supporting  
climate policy. In 2022, we engaged in the Council’s policy 
priority development process and invited C2ES leadership 
to speak about the business potential of the Inflation 
Reduction Act in an educational event for employees. 

In 2022, policymakers globally were engaged in defining 
climate disclosure regulations and took steps toward 
implementation. We engaged in advocacy through our 
industry groups to inform and further refine the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation’s draft 
sustainability reporting standards and U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposed rule to enhance 
and standardize climate-related disclosures for investors. 
We engaged with the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve and U.S. Treasury climate leadership on ESG 
data as it relates to target setting and financial institution 
decarbonization strategies.

In the European Union (EU), we regularly engage with 
the European Commission, Council and Parliament on 
the development of ESG regulations. Topics include the 
development of due diligence reporting requirements, 
corporate sustainability reporting requirements and the 
creation of an EU green bond standard, among others.  
In the U.K., we work with policymakers and provide 
commentary on the development of a range of legislative 
and policy documents, including the U.K.’s green finance 
strategy, disclosure requirements and the development  
of the green taxonomy.

Achieving Carbon-Neutral Operations
In 2022, we achieved our commitment to carbon neutrality across our global operations.

Our carbon neutrality status20 covers direct scope 1 
emissions from our operations, scope 2 location-based 
emissions from purchasing energy and scope 3 emissions 
from business travel and downstream leased assets. 
We achieved our goals of carbon neutrality and 100% 
renewable electricity through the following strategies: 

•   Reducing our energy use through efficiencies in our real 
estate by employing projects across our infrastructure. 
As of year-end 2022, our global GHG emissions (from 
locations-based accounting) have been reduced by 41% 
from a 2012 baseline. We have achieved this reduction 
while increasing the number of employees by 43%, with 
approximately the same overall square footage.

•   Securing a virtual power purchase agreement for a 

wind-based power system accounting for approximately 
50% of Morgan Stanley’s annual global electricity 
consumption. The 93-megawatt Bennington Wind Project 
in Illinois achieved operational completion in November 
2021. The Firm manages offtake of both power and 
renewable energy certificates (RECs) from the wind farm, 
retiring RECs to offset emissions from our North America 
electricity consumption.

•   Purchasing carbon offsets to compensate for our remaining 

emissions, in accordance with the following strategy: 

-   Our carbon offset portfolio follows a governance process 

•   Contracting directly for renewable electricity and buying 

to help ensure quality and credibility.

renewable energy certificates. We neutralized the 
remainder of our electricity-related emissions through a 
mix of on-site renewable power generation, green power 
purchase agreements and unbundled RECs. We seek 
to accelerate the global renewable energy market by 
purchasing RECs in countries where we have real estate 
and where REC markets exist. 

-   Our strategy focuses on removing carbon from the 
atmosphere, with removal credits accounting for 
approximately 70% of our portfolio in 2022.

-   All selected projects are certified by an internationally 

recognized carbon standard.

-   We pursue projects that deliver benefits supporting 

the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN 
SDGs). For example, an afforestation project in Uruguay, 
selected in consultation with our Commodities group, 
plants native tree species and converts degraded land 
into biodiverse forest.

-   We remain committed to pursuing high-quality offsets 

and explore the use of offset purchases to spur 
development in new technology.

20  The Firm’s carbon neutral status reflects the actions above. This is a management-determined metric that may be viewed or calculated differently by others 

who may use the same “carbon neutral” terminology. Morgan Stanley has determined that the boundary around our carbon neutrality status is scope 1, scope 2 
location-based emissions, scope 3 business travel and downstream leased assets, carbon offsets purchased from the voluntary carbon market, green power 
contracts, and market instruments (e.g. Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs)). There are instances where green power 
contracts and instruments that we accept for our purposes to meet carbon neutrality do not align with the criteria required to reflect those purchases in our 
scope 2 market-based figure in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) (“GHG Protocol”). 
For our GHG emissions table aligned with the GHG protocol, please see here.

Climate Strategy: Looking Ahead
Morgan Stanley’s climate strategy will continue to evolve alongside developments in 
science, technology and regulation. 

Similarly, our approach to our net-zero commitment will 
be iterative as methodologies, frameworks and climate 
data improve over time. In this report, we included our first 
“Approach to Transition” Index outlining the actions we 
take to advance our net-zero strategy and accelerate the 
transition to a low carbon economy. We will continue to 
monitor developments in methodologies, frameworks and 
guidance, and our future disclosures will reflect updates  
to our net-zero strategy.

As we continue to enhance our climate-related risk 
management and business activity, we plan to take the 
following steps over time:

•   Develop a transition plan that we will continue to  

evaluate and advance as methodologies, guidance  
and regulations continue to evolve. 

•   Set new sector targets that increase the scope of 

financed emissions covered, including with respect 
to capital markets facilitation activities once PCAF’s 
guidance and related methodology are finalized. 

•   Reassess our interim targets and related metrics and 

consider alternative approaches to help ensure that we 
have the appropriate guideposts to achieve our 2050  
net-zero goal. 

•   Continue to enhance our CSAF framework as a tool to 
engage with clients on their transition plans, tailor  
climate solutions, and assist with understanding and 
addressing transition risk in our lending business.

•   Expand climate-focused education for Morgan Stanley 
employees to ensure they are best equipped to help 
clients on their transition journey. 

•   Update the Firm’s long-term climate scenario narratives 
and expand in-house capabilities including qualitative 
and quantitative assessment techniques (see pages 
24-25 of our 2021 Climate Report for more information). 
We also plan to expand their use to help inform risk and 
opportunity identification.

Climate Risk Management

Climate change poses a significant risk to the global financial system and, in turn,  
the stability of economies globally. 

The impacts of climate change range in nature, severity  
and frequency, and therefore it is critical for financial 
institutions to understand how such impacts may affect  
their business and clients. Firm Risk Management (FRM),  
in partnership with other areas of the Firm, continues to  
focus on identifying and managing risks related to climate  
change to limit their potential impact to Morgan Stanley.

Defining Climate Risks

As informed by the TCFD, as well as various non-
governmental organizations, regulators and financial 
institutions, Morgan Stanley categorizes the risks  
associated with climate change into two groups:  
transition risks and physical risks. 

Transition Risks: Risks associated with the move to  
a low-carbon economy, generally falling into one of  
three categories: 

1    Policy and legal changes, such as local, national  
or international regulation of carbon emissions 

2    Technology advancements, such as replacement of 

existing products with lower-emission options 

3    Market changes, such as changes in consumer and 
business sentiment or impacts resulting from public 
perception of an organization’s action or inaction on 
climate change. 

Depending on the nature, speed and breadth of these 
changes, transition risks may pose varying degrees of 
financial, reputational, regulatory, compliance and other 
risk to Morgan Stanley as well as our clients or third parties 
on which we rely. Over the longer term, negative impacts of 
transition risks on certain of our clients, such as decreased 
profitability and stranded assets, could lead to increased 
credit and counter-party risk to us. The impacts of these 
and other transition risks could increase our expenses and 
adversely impact our strategies, including by limiting our 
ability to pursue certain business activities or offer certain 
products and services.

Physical Risks: The physical impacts of climate change 
include harm to people and property arising from acute  
climate-related events such as hurricanes, heatwaves, 
floods or wildfire, and chronic, longer-term shifts in climate 
patterns, such as higher average temperatures, rising sea 
levels and long-term drought. Such events could disrupt our 
operations or those of our clients or third parties on which 
we rely, including through direct damage to physical assets 
and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and 
market volatility. Over the longer term, these events could 
impact the ability of certain of our clients or customers to 
repay their obligations, reduce the value of collateral, limit 
insurance coverage and result in other effects.

MANAGING CLIMATE RISK

Morgan Stanley continues to expand its capabilities 
for identifying and managing the risks associated with 
climate change for the benefit of our clients, employees 
and shareholders. To that end, Firm Risk Management 
(FRM) is responsible for overseeing the management of 
Morgan Stanley’s climate-related financial risks. In 2022, 
FRM established a Central Climate Risk Team, which is 
responsible for working with stakeholders in FRM and across 
the Firm to identify, monitor, mitigate and report on the 
climate-related financial risks that the Firm may face.  
Given the global nature of climate risk, the Central Climate 
Risk Team includes members in regions around the world 
where Morgan Stanley has a significant presence,  
including the Americas, EMEA and APAC. 

Morgan Stanley views climate risk not as a stand-alone  
risk type, but as an overarching risk that can impact other 
risk types, such as Credit Risk, Market Risk, Operational 
Risk and Liquidity Risk. As climate risk is interconnected 
with other risk types, we have developed and continue to 
enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations 
into our risk management strategies and governance 
structures. 

The table below describes the risk types overseen by  
FRM and the means by which they may be impacted by 
climate risks. 

RISK TYPE

DEFINITION

Risk of loss arising when a 
borrower, counterparty or issuer 
does not meet its financial 
obligations to Morgan Stanley

Credit

Market

Liquidity 

Market risk refers to the risk that a 
change in the level of one or more 
market prices, rates, spreads, 
indices, volatilities, correlations 
or other market factors, such 
as market liquidity, will result in 
losses for a position or portfolio 
owned by us.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the 
Firm will be unable to finance its 
operations due to a loss of access 
to the capital markets or difficulty 
in liquidating its assets. Such risks 
include the Firm’s ability or perceived 
ability to meet its financial obligations 
in a timely manner. Liquidity risk 
encompasses the associated funding 
risk triggered by stress events,  
which may negatively affect the 
Firm’s liquidity and may impact its 
ability to raise new funding.

TRANSITION RISK  
EXAMPLES

PHYSICAL RISK 
EXAMPLES

Increase in defaults or rating 
downgrades within carbon-
intensive industries due to 
increased costs resulting 
from new climate regulation 
(e.g., a carbon tax), or loss 
of income/profits as a result 
of changing consumer 
preferences towards  
green products

New climate regulation 
or change in consumer 
preferences negatively 
impacts the demand for 
a product (e.g., internal 
combustion engines), 
leading to a fall in car 
manufacturers’ equity or 
corporate bond price

New regulation of carbon-
intensive industries leads to 
loss of income/profits for 
certain borrowers, leading 
to liquidity needs from 
the impacted clients (i.e., 
outflows from increased 
draws against loan facilities)

Increase in defaults, 
rating downgrades 
within various real 
estate portfolios driven 
by a severe weather 
event (e.g., flood, 
hurricane, wildfire)

Severe weather 
events may damage 
production facilities 
(e.g., gas processing 
facilities), reducing 
production and 
increasing prices for a 
particular commodity 
in the front of the curve

A large-scale severe 
weather event such as 
a hurricane damages 
properties in real estate 
portfolios and disrupts 
operations for other 
borrowers, leading 
to liquidity needs 
from the impacted 
clients (i.e., outflows 
from increased draws 
against loan facilities)

Operational

Risk resulting from inadequate or 
failed processes or systems, from 
human factors or external events  
(e.g., fraud, theft, compliance, 
cyberattacks or damage to physical 
assets) which could adversely  
affect our business or reputation.

a.  Firm’s physical office 

locations

b.  Business continuity 

and resilience

c. Compliance

Increasing and evolving

Morgan Stanley’s Risk Management Framework

Morgan Stanley manages climate risk through the application of its standard risk management framework. This framework is 
divided into four steps: 

1

Identify

2

Measure

4

Communicate

3

Manage

RISK IDENTIFICATION

SCENARIO ANALYSIS 

The first step in managing climate risk requires correct 
identification of the climate risks that may impact 
Morgan Stanley’s products, business lines and physical 
footprint. As with other types of risk identification, climate 
risk identification is critical to the measurement, monitoring 
and mitigation of financial risks to Morgan Stanley. 

Scenario analysis utilizes a variety of approaches to identify 
potential vulnerabilities in our business and to measure the 
resulting impact. We leverage Morgan Stanley’s internal risk 
inventory and materiality assessments to inform the design 
of our climate scenarios, which emphasize either transition 
risk or physical risk. 

Morgan Stanley monitors external developments and  
tracks the latest science to understand the climate risks 
posed to the Firm. FRM continues to evolve its centralized 
risk identification inventory to identify appropriate  
climate-related risks.

Transition Risk Scenario Analysis

Transition risk scenario analysis helps Morgan Stanley 
understand how a move to a low-carbon economy 
may create financial risks to the Firm. Morgan Stanley 
leverages regulatory scenarios and scenarios from the 
Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the 
Financial System (NGFS) for guidance and best-practices 
when designing transition risk scenarios. Transition risk 
scenarios are chosen based on the Firm’s risk profile, 
emerging changes in policies (such as carbon pricing) and 
the potential economic impact of such policy changes. 
Scenarios may be conducted for different time horizons and 
consider exposure concentrations by sector and industry. 

To conduct the analysis, FRM leverages existing economic 
scenario forecast models as a starting point to develop 
climate scenario forecasts. This approach allows FRM to 
capture key macroeconomic and financial market variables 
across regions and sectors. Climate-specific variables 
are then taken from widely recognized industry sources 
such as NGFS, or through input from Morgan Stanley 
Research. These variables are then incorporated into the 
macroeconomic scenarios.

Physical Risk Scenario Analysis

Physical risk scenario analysis helps Morgan Stanley 
understand the potential impact that acute or chronic 
weather events could have on the business. Physical risk 
scenarios leverage internal inputs and models and adjust 
them for climate-specific factors based on the scenario 
narrative. The scenarios in focus are determined by  
material risks identified through the risk identification  
and materiality assessment processes. 

Morgan Stanley has analyzed the potential financial 
consequences of climate events of varying impact, 
including acute events such as violent weather. The 
portfolios in scope are generally those we have identified 
as having concentrations in geographies impacted by the 
physical risk being analyzed, including our corporates, 
commodities and real estate portfolios.

In addition, Morgan Stanley’s Operational Risk Department 
runs scenarios to assess and quantify potential losses that 
Morgan Stanley may incur as a result of climate-related 
physical risks. Supported by our Fusion Resilience Center, 
which researches the potential threats to operations, the 
Operational Risk Department identifies and ranks the 
key physical risks for each of our main office locations. 

The physical risks are assessed in terms of damages to 
Morgan Stanley’s physical assets as well as incremental 
losses incurred to maintain operations. As part of 
the assessment, the scenarios consider the potential 
occurrence of unprecedented catastrophic events  
caused by climate change. 

Time Horizons for Scenario Analysis

Both transition and physical risks can materialize over 
different time horizons. For example, episodic extreme 
hurricanes present near-term physical risks to vulnerable 
regions and populations, while transition risk measures, 
such as carbon taxes, present longer-term challenges 
as economies adjust to increased costs and market or 
technological changes stemming from new tax policy. 
Institutions, such as Morgan Stanley, therefore face the 
challenge of not only identifying material climate risks to 
their business, but also analyzing the likely duration and 
trajectory of each physical and transition risk they face.

Climate Risk Governance 

We maintain a robust governance process to regularly 
communicate climate risk updates to key internal 
stakeholders and committees. This process ensures 
appropriate oversight and transparency. With respect to 
the process, there are several committees that exclusively 
focus on climate risk. The Climate Risk Committee (CRC) 
reports to the Firm Risk Committee and subsequently the 
Board Risk Committee, and oversees matters relating to the  
Firm’s financial and non-financial exposure to climate risk,  

including monitoring the Firm’s climate-related commitments, 
and reviewing and/or approving certain emissions-related 
matters. As the primary climate risk committee, the CRC 
oversees a number of subcommittees, which between them 
are responsible for reviewing climate risk-related matters 
within FRM and approving certain emissions-related matters. 
The CRC also receives reports from a number of Business 
Unit and regional ESG committees on climate risk-related 
matters, as reflected in ESG Governance here.

 Climate Metrics and Targets

Metrics and targets help track our efforts to achieve our net-zero commitment,  
and are important across all four pillars of our climate strategy. 

Financed Emissions Lending Intensity—
Interim Target Sectors

We measure progress against our interim net-zero targets 
which are based on our financed emissions lending intensity 
(FELI) metric. For an in-depth explanation of this metric, 
please see the Methodology for Morgan Stanley’s 2030 
Interim Financed Emissions Targets on the Path to Net-Zero.

We announced our 2030 interim emission reduction targets 
in late 2021 and set our emissions baseline year as 2019. On 
page 55, we disclose our financed emissions lending intensity 
(FELI) for 2019, 2020 and 2021 (for more detail on our 2019 
baseline emissions data, see our 2021 Climate Report).

It is important to note that these results reflect lending 
activities prior to the establishment of our interim targets, 
set in November 2021. The three years of FELI data reported 
cover a timeframe during which our business activities 
were not managed to our commitment to net-zero financed 
emissions. We provide these figures for reference.

Increased emissions reporting by companies is extremely 
helpful in improving the accuracy of our financed emissions 
metrics. However, this makes year over year trend analysis 
particularly challenging. As companies expand their 
reporting coverage to additional categories of emissions, 
particularly scope 3 emissions categories, they report 
higher emissions year over year, which results in our 
financed emissions metrics trending upwards. It also means 
that our 2019 baseline is likely to be under-representing  
the emissions during that year. 

As such, emissions will appear to increase over time if: 

•  Prior years’ figures are not revised, or restated.

•   Current modeling approaches are not adjusted to account 
for these revised reporting approaches, where possible. 

The result of this dynamic is that emissions data may not be 
representative of, or well correlated to, underlying company 
performance. In particular, we have seen that production 
of oil and gas among portfolio companies covered by our 
Energy emissions target has remained relatively flat, while 
we’ve seen an uptick in scope 3 emissions from 2019 
to 2021. For example, a company may only report one 
category of scope 3 emissions in 2019, but in 2021 report  
2+ categories. This would show an increase in emissions  
for a company that may not have actually happened.

How Carbon Emissions Data Challenges 
Impact Our Target Reporting

Carbon data for our clients’ scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions is 
evolving and improving. During this period of data quality 
improvement, we have seen that the data has significant 
variability year-over-year. Carbon data quality is highly 
impacted by the extent to which companies are reporting 
emissions data. In the past three years, we have seen a 
notable increase in emissions data reported by companies, 
which is helpful in improving the accuracy of our metrics. 
However, it also means that our metrics, which rely on that 
data, have some volatility as well.

As discussed in our previous years’ climate reporting, 
carbon data also has a significant time lag, which means 
that we do not obtain new client carbon data sets until 
12-18+ months after the underlying emissions-generating 
activities have taken place. We expect this lag to reduce 
over time. However, it means that we currently must make 
real-time business decisions with data that is both evolving 
in quality and delayed. 

With that as the backdrop, several different factors 
influence the movement of our FELI metric. We explain 
these dynamics in more detail in the attribution analysis 
section below. These factors include:

•   Portfolio mix of our corporate relationship and event loans

•  Fluctuations in enterprise value including cash (EVIC)

•   Methodologies used to calculate a portfolio company’s 
estimated emissions where they are not reported by  
the company

•  Changes in a portfolio company’s actual emissions

•   Change in scope of emissions reported by portfolio 

companies

INTRODUCTION       PEOPLE AND CULTURE       DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION       CLIMATE       SUSTAINABILITY       SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES       APPENDICES

Looking Forward

These challenges are industry-wide and not specific to  
our method of tracking emissions or our clients’ production 
activities. As data improves, we expect reported emissions 
to be more representative of actual emissions from their 
underlying activities, and thus more accurately reflect how 
our clients are working to address their own emissions 
footprint. 

For this reason, we encourage companies across all sectors, 
especially high-emitting sectors, to report emissions data 
accurately and comprehensively and to also restate prior 
years, where appropriate. 

We remain committed to our net-zero and interim emissions 
targets. As detailed in the section “Our Approach to the Net-
Zero Transition”, we have a clear strategy to engage with 
our clients to meet our commitments and reduce FELI over 
time, including by leveraging a range of data to help drive 
decisions. Our CSAF framework will provide forward-looking 
data on our clients which complements GHG emissions data, 
which are historical. 

As stated in our public methodology document, we view 
this journey as iterative, and we will continue to evolve our 
approach as the data and disclosure evolves. To that end,  
we will evaluate our sources of data, our target methodology 
and our disclosure options over time to help ensure the 
metrics that we publicly report are aligned with our  
business and our clients’ activities. 

Restatements

This year, a key provider of GHG emissions data for our FELI 
analysis changed its methodology to restate certain prior-
year scope 3 data. The goal of this change was to enhance 
the quality, accuracy, and comparability of a company’s 
emissions performance over time. 

Previously, a restated prior year emissions number was  
only done in the case of an error. Now, the restated data 
reflects when companies restate prior year figures. This 
increased the number of restated figures in the 2019  
data and resulted in changes to the sources of underlying 
sector-specific datasets used by the data provider. 

However, restatements are limited to companies retroactively 
restating scope level numbers wholly. Restatements will 
not occur if a company expanded scope 3 sub-category 
reporting in a current year, but not a prior year. The result 
may be an increase in emissions due to reporting at the sub-
category levels, which may make emissions challenging to 
compare on a year-over-year basis.

We have incorporated the data provider’s updated scope 3 
company emissions values into our previously published  
2019 FELI and Absolute Financed Emissions (AFE) results for 
our three interim target sectors, as shown in the table below.  
This restatement supports enhanced consistency across 
reporting years. Our 2030 targets remain unchanged, and  
our baseline is now the restated 2019 FELI results.

As data and methodologies continue to improve, we may 
make additional restatements to our financed emissions 
reporting as appropriate. We also encourage all emissions 
data providers to provide public information on their 
restatement methodologies, and to explore the inclusion  
of restated data across all emission scopes.

SECTOR ATTRIBUTION ANALYSIS

Auto Manufacturing: After a decline in 2020, our Auto 
FELI increased by 42% in 2021. This was primarily due to a 
corporate merger between two borrowers which resulted 
in updated absolute emissions reporting for the newly 
merged company. This made the data less comparable 
to prior-year emissions for each company pre-merger. 
Absent this transaction, our FELI would have continued a 
downward trend in 2021. The majority of our current Auto 
Manufacturing clients have demonstrated plans to grow 
electric vehicle production and are benefiting from changes 
in government policy designed to further decarbonize the 
transportation sector. With that as the backdrop, we expect 
to see continued FELI declines in our Auto Manufacturing 
sector target over time.

Energy: FELI increased by 22% in 2020 and 10% in 2021. 
In 2020, a reduction in the carbon emissions of our loan 
portfolio was offset by lower EVIC valuations and a change 
in the portfolio mix. In 2021, the opposite occurred. There 
was a positive portfolio mix shift and increase in EVIC, 
however the reporting of carbon emissions increased 
significantly. The emissions increase can be primarily 
attributed to improvements in portfolio companies’ 
disclosure quality and methodology, including a number  
of companies that reported for the first time in 2021. It also 
stems from companies’ expanded reporting of additional 
scope 3 sub-categories and additional types of products 
accounted for in Use of Sold Product lifecycle emissions 

measurements. We do however recognize that a small  
amount of the increase was due to upticks in underlying oil  
and gas production from certain clients, which is in line with 
global energy production trends during this period.

Power: FELI for our Power sector target decreased 
significantly by 15% in 2021 compared to our 2019 baseline. 
This was driven by a decline in global electricity generation 
volumes from FY19 to FY20 as Covid-19 restrictions were 
enacted and our clients’ focus on evolving their power 
generation mix to lower emissions sources. It also reflects 
our increased financing to companies with lower emissions 
intensity. Overall, electric power providers continue to seek  
to expand electricity generation from renewables. We also  
see our clients in this sector moving to incorporate battery 
storage technology, and the adoption of new policies that we 
expect will accelerate the adoption of zero-carbon power.  
We saw a slight uptick in FELI from 2020 to 2021 due to 
increased company emissions with the recovery in global 
generation as Covid-19 restrictions were lifted.

Given the data limitations and challenges outlined above 
regarding higher quality data leading to increasing figures over 
time, we also performed a sensitivity analysis to understand 
the impact on FELI if we held borrower carbon values constant 
across all years using 2021 company emissions (and emission 
factors) which represent the most current and accurate results. 
Under these assumptions, we estimate that our 2019 baseline 
FELI for Energy would have been 21% higher than our current 
restated value and 11% higher for Auto Manufacturing.

21  For details on how the FELI metric is calculated, please view the Methodology for Morgan Stanley’s 2030 Interim Financed Emissions Targets on the Path to Net-Zero.

companies’ value chains.

Absolute Financed Emissions (AFE) 

Our 2030 commitments utilize our FELI metric. We recognize 
that absolute emissions provide helpful additional context, 
which is why we also report absolute emissions information, 
in line with our commitment to PCAF. However, our AFE 
results also demonstrate the variability of using drawn 
exposure amounts, compared to committed exposure, to 
measure our financed emissions impact.

For the Auto Manufacturing sector portfolio, our AFE results 
demonstrate a substantial decline across the three years. 
This is primarily due to a decrease in the total amount that 
companies in this portfolio drew against their loans, and a 
shift towards clients with lower carbon intensity footprints.

Within the Energy sector portfolio, the total amount that 
companies drew against their loans decreased across all 
three years. However, upstream exploration and production 
companies represented a higher share of drawn amounts 
in 2020, hence an increase in AFE given their higher 
carbon intensity versus other transportation and services 
companies in the sector. This client mix shifted back in  
2021, leading to the year-over-year decline between 2020 
and 2021. 

For the Power sector portfolio, the large increase in 2021 
is driven by a single client with a higher carbon intensity 
profile, which did not draw down on its loan in prior years.

PCAF Data Quality Scores 

Morgan Stanley calculates data quality scores for our 
financed emissions reporting in accordance with the  
PCAF guidelines. These scores indicate the data quality 
associated with the emissions data underlying our 
calculations based on the source of the data, on a scale 
from 1 to 5 with 1 being the highest quality. For example, 
company-reported emissions are scored as higher data 
quality as they are specific and may be third-party verified, 
whereas economic activity-based emissions factors which 
are used to estimate company emissions are considered 
lower data quality. PCAF guidance recommends calculating 
a data quality score for scopes 1 and 2 separate from a 
score for scope 3. For more information on the PCAF Data 
Quality scale, see the PCAF methodology document.

The Absolute Financed Emissions metric includes only a 
subset of companies within our portfolio which have drawn 
exposure at year-end, whereas the FELI metric includes all 
companies with our portfolio. As such, we consider that 
reporting data quality scores for both metrics is important  
to understand and represent our progress.

Across our portfolio, we observed incremental 
improvements in scope 1 and 2 data quality from 2019 
to 2021. For FELI, our scope 1 and 2 portfolio data quality 
score improved from 2.5 to 2.3, and for FELI, our score 
improved from 3.4 to 3.2. However, we continue to see an 
overall lower level of reported scope 3 emissions data from 
companies. For AFE, our scope 3 portfolio data quality score  
marginally declined from 3.5 in 2019 to 3.6 in 2021. However  
when our full set of clients is considered through the FELI 
metric, our score marginally improved from 2.9 to 2.8.

Climate Data Limitations and Challenges

As noted earlier in this report, emissions data continues  
to have significant limitations and challenges. Below 
we describe these challenges in order to educate our 
stakeholders about the complexity in calculating FELI  
and financed emissions. 

Data Lag: As discussed in our 2021 Climate Report,  
emissions data is often unavailable until 12-18+ months  
after the fiscal year-end, far exceeding common financial 
reporting timeframes. This lag is due to a range of factors 
including company GHG data reporting cycles; the time it  
takes for vendors to source, aggregate and analyze data;  
and vendor data quality checks. 

This requires making internal decisions utilizing data that is 
often not up to date and therefore not reflective of current 
practices from clients. The other implication of this lag is 
that when the emissions are disclosed 1.5-2 years later 
utilizing matching portfolio data and GHG emissions data  
as PCAF suggests, the public figures are not the same as  
the data that was being managed to at that point in time. 
Said another way, financial institutions will not know the 
actual results of business decisions and performance  
until a year and half later. 

Limited Company Reporting: Another limitation financial 
institutions must manage is the lack of company reporting 
across GHG scopes, especially for scope 3 emissions. 
Scope 3 data is generally estimated by third-party 
providers because it is often underreported. Therefore, 
scope 3 emissions data is heavily dependent on estimation 
methodologies which can differ across data providers, 
making year-over-year result comparisons more  
challenging. 

As indicated in the charts below, this is particularly  
significant in the Energy sector, where scope 3 is the most 
material contributor of the sector’s emissions. For reporting 
2021, we found only 35% of energy companies within our 
portfolio report scope 3 emissions compared to over 60% 
for Auto Manufacturing and Power.

Furthermore, the GHG Protocol methodology directs 
companies to decide which underlying scope 3 emissions 
sub-categories are most relevant to their respective 
operations. Companies within the same sub-sector may 
determine different underlying categories as relevant in  
their emissions disclosures. In some cases, companies may  
determine categories relevant, but may opt to not report. 
These GHG reporting nuances introduce significant 
variability across reporting boundaries for scope 3 emissions 
from both figures derived from data providers and those 
reported by companies, making comparisons difficult.

Data Provider-Specific Methodology Decisions: Our 
financed emissions calculations depend on GHG data from 
two primary sources—company-reported emissions data 
and third-party data provider estimations (see our 2030 
Interim Targets Methodology for details). For reported 
emissions data companies report different GHG emission 
figures across different disclosure channels. For example, 
the same company might report different emissions figures 
in its CDP report, its annual report, and/or its sustainability 
report. Third-party data providers do not uniformly select 
one disclosure type over another source, resulting in 
differences across these data providers. 

In addition, data providers can retroactively implement 
changes in their own estimation methodology year on year, 

which could lead to restatement of prior years’ data.  
On the other hand, some data providers may choose not  
to revise or update their prior years’ emissions data sets 
when companies restate their own data. These third-party 
data providers may also choose to estimate emissions 
data even where reported data is available if the company 
underwent a significant corporate action such as an initial 
public offering or a corporate merger. In other cases,  
data providers may implement methodological changes  
to improve accuracy, but may limit such changes to  
certain years or certain reporting boundaries. Any of  
these instances potentially create anomalous results  
when comparing these estimates to prior year reported  
emissions, complicating trend analysis.

Example of Updated Company Disclosure Leading to Year-over-Year Discrepancy

Year-over-year variances in reported emissions are not necessarily correlated with an Energy company’s production and related end-use 
emissions. The data in this example has been anonymized but is representative of a change in emissions values disclosed by a company and 
the values reported by data providers.

For the first time, an oil and gas producer disclosed its emissions for the most recent year (2021) and the previous year (2020). A data  
provider which used a production-based estimate for the company’s 2020 emissions pivots to utilize the company’s reported value for 2021 
emissions. However, the data provider does not retroactively revise or restate its prior year estimate for the company’s 2020 emissions. 

In this example, there is a resulting discrepancy between the company’s reported change in emissions (-20% YoY) and the implied change 
(+300% YoY), while erroneously demonstrating an inverse relationship to annual production which decreased (-5%) over the same period.

Our goal in sharing this case study is to illustrate the complexities in the data dynamics which drive the results of our FELI emissions.  
Over time, we expect increased company reporting and consistency in the relationship between emissions data as reported and underlying 
production and use of sold products.

Minimizing Our Environmental Footprint

From 2012 through 2022, Morgan Stanley reduced its total 
location-based emissions by 41% and its market-based 
emissions by 74%. Key strategies to reduce emissions 
include increasing the efficiency of our infrastructure and 
using renewable electricity on-site. We are also working to 
enhance the efficiency of our heating, air-conditioning and 
ventilation systems (HVAC); reducing the water intensity 
of our HVAC; focusing on plug load management to reduce 
parasitic losses; and leveraging daylighting to improve the 
employee workplace while reducing lighting loads.

In 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to 
reduced emissions due to remote working and reduced 
travel. In 2022, we began to see the impact of returning to 
work and increased business travel across our emissions 
aligning to declining health and safety restrictions. In 
particular, scope 1 increased due to higher utilization of 
office real estate and vehicles and aircraft operated by 
the Firm or employees, scope 2 increased due to higher 
utilization of office and data center real estate reflecting 
increased use and technology business demand, and  
scope 3 increased due to increased business travel.

Delivering Actionable Analysis 
The ISI informs and empowers the growing number of investors looking to drive environmental and social 
impact. Our thought leadership focuses on trends driving sustainable investing and critical thematic issues 
such as climate change and inclusive economic growth. 2022 examples are highlighted below: 

INCLUSIVE GROWTH

Sustainable Reality

Strong Inclusive Growth Performance  
Drives Down Risk for Bondholders

With the global economy on the rebound, corporations have 
a critical role to play in delivering an inclusive recovery that 
addresses the glaring social and economic disparities exposed  
by the pandemic and the renewed focus on issues of social  
justice in the U.S. Grasping this opportunity brings benefits to 
society and can also improve risk and return profiles for bonds,  
as demonstrated by new research from the Morgan Stanley  
Institute for Sustainable Investing. 

KEY INSIGHTS 

Inclusive Growth in Context  

Quantifying Corporate 
Performance on Inclusive  
Growth  

Our Findings  

Corporations have far-reaching impacts on society, their 
stakeholders and economic growth through the decisions 
they make across four key areas of business: their employees, 
products and services, operations and management practices. 
Their choices can either support or hinder inclusive growth  
that delivers broad-based economic gains and opportunity.  
This brief introduces the Institute’s proprietary Inclusive 
Growth Score, which measures company performance across 
these four key areas. When we applied the metric to the U.S. 
corporate bond market, we found that investors, on average, 

viewed bonds issued by high-scoring companies as less risky 
than bonds issued by low-scoring companies during 2020’s 
severe market volatility.  

These findings reinforce previous Institute analyses showing 
that investment funds incorporating social and environmental 
criteria can outperform their traditional counterparts. Our 
Inclusive Growth Score offers a valuable new quantitative 
metric to support investors, corporate decision makers and 
other stakeholders as they pursue a sustainable and resilient 
post-pandemic global economy.

Opportunities for Asset Managers to Meet Asset Owner Demands

SUSTAINABLE INVESTING

There is a major opportunity for asset managers to better align 
their sustainable investment practices, products and reporting 
with the expectations and priorities of asset owners globally, 
according to the latest Sustainable Signals survey from the 
Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing. For the first 
time, the survey combines insights from both asset owners and 
asset managers to give a more complete industry snapshot. Our 
findings suggest that if asset managers were to take advantage 
of the opportunity, and if gaps in ESG data and unmet demand 
for specialized talent were addressed, then this could help 
boost sustainable investing market growth opportunities.

ADDRESSING PLASTIC WASTE, ADVANCING A  
CIRCULAR ECONOMY 

Managing plastic waste is a pressing environmental 
challenge and an opportunity to reinvent how the world 
treats natural resources by implementing a circular 
economy. The ISI leads our efforts, working with  
clients and partners to help shift the global economy  
away from single-use plastic. 

In 2019, we announced our Plastic Waste Resolution to 
help facilitate the prevention, reduction and removal of 50 
million metric tons of discarded plastic from rivers, oceans, 
landscapes and landfills by 2030. As of year-end 2022, 
our estimates suggest that we supported the prevention, 
removal or reduction of nearly 14 million metric tons of 
plastic waste from entering the environment and landfills by 
2030. We incorporate relevant transactions and operational 
activities in calculating our progress. These include:

•   Recykal, a circular economy-focused company digitizing 

the supply chain for waste and connecting waste 
generators directly with waste processors and recyclers, 
received investment from the Morgan Stanley India 
Infrastructure. At the time of investment in January 2022, 
the company had channelized more than 100,000 metric 
tons of dry waste back into the circular economy and 
away from landfills and water bodies.

•   PepsiCo’s $1.25Bn 10-year green bond, for which 

Morgan Stanley served as a bookrunner. PepsiCo's new 
Green Bond Framework outlines four environmental 
categories where funding can be directed, all of which 
align with at least one UN SDG. This includes Regenerative 
Agriculture (UN SDG 2 and 8) and circular economy and 
virgin plastic waste reduction (UN SDG 9 and 12) in line 
with PepsiCo’s goal to use 50% recycled plastic content in 
its packaging by 2030. In addition, PepsiCo's Green Bond 
Framework furthers the company’s ability to direct funding 
to projects that strengthen recycling infrastructure.

Fostering Innovation 
The ISI leverages Morgan Stanley’s global 
experience and market perspective to advance  
the field of sustainable investing. The ISI also  
drives Firmwide initiatives and innovation to  
address sustainability challenges.

SUSTAINABLE INVESTING SUMMIT

The annual Morgan Stanley Sustainable Investing Summit 
brings together global sustainability thought leaders and 
practitioners to share innovative ideas that are redefining 
capital markets and approaches to sustainability challenges. 

The fourth virtual summit in October 2022 focused on 
the importance of investing in resilient and sustainable 
systems. Global leaders discussed the impact of extreme 
heat on cities, the business case for mental health support, 
innovation in materials sciences and investing in social 
justice causes, and more. 

SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS COLLABORATIVE

The world’s most pressing sustainability challenges 
require highly scalable, systems-level solutions. In 2020, 
Morgan Stanley launched the Sustainable Solutions 
Collaborative to support startups with the potential to 
provide such breakthrough innovation. Each year,  
through a rigorous selection process, the ISI invites five 
organizations to join the Sustainable Solutions Collaborative. 
Each organization receives a grant and engages with our 
experts in a year-long supportive partnership intended to 
help scale their solution.

2022’s second cohort consisted of:

•   Notpla, a U.K.-based sustainable packaging startup  

(see case study here).

•   CarbonBuilt, from Los Angeles, California, delivers a 

scalable concrete product that reduces carbon emissions 
by 70% compared with traditional concrete, without 
compromising performance or production cost.

•   ISeeChange, a data company from New Orleans, 

Louisiana, empowers communities to report and track 
climate change impact.

•   OceanMind, a nonprofit based in the U.K., aids 

enforcement and compliance efforts to protect the  
world’s oceans. 

•   Teesas, a Nigeria-based EdTech startup, delivers 
curriculum-aligned online educational content to 
elementary school students across the African continent.

Morgan Stanley is invested in developing the next generation of sustainable investing leaders through 
fellowships and strategic partnerships. 

SUSTAINABLE INVESTING FELLOWSHIP

We enable talented graduate students to learn from our 
sustainability experts and ESG investing specialists across 
the Firm. Each year, our Sustainable Investing Fellowship 
places successful candidates in our New York City 
headquarters and London office. In 2022, 490 students 
applied for seven positions, with selected applicants  
placed in GSO, Equity Research, Global Capital Markets, 
Wealth Management and Investment Management. 

SUSTAINABLE INVESTING CHALLENGE 

The Kellogg-Morgan Stanley Sustainable Investing 
Challenge invites graduate students to invent financial 
solutions to social and environmental challenges that can 
also achieve market-rate financial returns. In 2022, the 
competition’s 12th year, more than 250+ graduate students 
forming 77 teams from 35 countries submitted entries. 

Volunteers from across the sustainable investing community 
offered their services as mentors and judges, helping 
identify 16 teams to advance to the final pitch day. 

Students from the University of Cambridge’s Judge 
Business School in the U.K. won the top prize for their 
prospectus, which leveraged a parametric insurance model 
to help protect and restore coastal mangrove forests. 
The Coast Haven Brokerage team proposed a platform 
connecting mangrove beneficiaries such as tourism 
industries and governments with impact investors, project 
developers and ecosystem restoration experts. The runner-
up prize went to a team from the Fletcher School of Law 
and Diplomacy at Tufts University in the United States. 
Their proposed GOAL Fund would finance the acquisition 
and restoration of land around decommissioned oil and 
gas wells, leveraging private equity and carbon credits for 
remediation work.

Risk Management  

Risk is an inherent part of financial services, and effective risk management is vital to 
the success of our Firm. 

Our policies and procedures identify, measure, monitor, 
escalate, mitigate and control the principal risks facing our 
three businesses and the larger Firm. Our Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) framework integrates the diverse roles 
of risk management into a holistic enterprise structure and 
incorporates risk assessment into Firm decision-making 
processes.

Our business activity principal risks include market 
(including non-trading risks), credit, operational, model, 
compliance, cybersecurity, liquidity, strategic, reputational 
and conduct risk. Strategic risk is integrated into our 
business planning, embedded in the evaluation of all 
principal risks and overseen by our Board. 

The cornerstone of our risk management philosophy is 
the pursuit of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk-
taking that protects our capital base and franchise. This 
philosophy is implemented through the ERM framework, 
and five key principles comprise this philosophy: integrity, 
comprehensiveness, independence, accountability and 
transparency.

Addressing Environmental and Social Risk

Our due diligence and risk management processes are 
designed to identify, assess and address potentially 
significant environmental and social issues relevant to the 
Firm, our clients and our stakeholders. Our Environmental 
and Social Risk Management (ESRM) Group provides 
internal subject matter expertise on environmental and 
social risk, manages development and implementation of 
the Environmental and Social Policy Statement and related 
policies and procedures, conducts due diligence on relevant 
transactions, engages with stakeholders, and monitors 
emerging risks and developments in partnership with the 
business units, GSO, and other relevant control functions. 

Morgan Stanley regularly engages external and internal 
stakeholders on environmental and social topics and we  
review our policies annually and update them as necessary  
to reflect our strategy and key developments. 

As a result of this year’s review of the Environmental and 
Social Policy Statement, we have committed to enhance our 
approach to managing certain deforestation risks.

REVIEWING TRANSACTIONS

Transactions that pose potential environmental and social 
risks are reviewed by the relevant business units and the 
ESRM Group as outlined in the ESPS. When particular issues 
are identified, we conduct enhanced due diligence, which 
may involve reviewing how risks related to human rights, 
adverse impacts on communities or Indigenous Peoples, 
or abatement of GHGs and other emissions are managed. 
Transactions that carry potential franchise risks associated 
with environmental and social issues may also be escalated 
to senior management and/or our Regional and Global 
Franchise Committees. 

2022 Transaction Reviews in Practice: 

•   In 2022, the ESRM Group assessed Morgan Stanley’s 
potential participation in a financing opportunity 
involving a mining company. The ESRM Group worked 
with the relevant business unit to conduct a review of the 
potential environmental and social impacts associated 
with the company’s operations, including an assessment 
of the mining processes, existing and planned energy 
sources, and waste management practices. Upon review, 
Morgan Stanley declined to act on this transaction.

•   Morgan Stanley was asked to provide advisory services 
to a client in the industrial sector that was entering into 
a joint venture with a mining company and a mineral 
processor to establish a strategic supply chain capability. 
As part of its due diligence, the ESRM Group reviewed the 
environmental and social risk management frameworks 
as well as related commitments and performance of 
the various parties involved. Following a number of 
assessments that included the results of an onsite visit, 
review of technical reports and direct engagement 
with the client’s management, we determined that the 
client’s efforts to mitigate potential risks were adequate. 
Morgan Stanley decided to proceed with the transaction.

For more information on ESRM’s process and tailored 
approaches to certain sectors and cross-sectors, please 
refer to our Environmental and Social Policy Statement.

Operational Resilience 

The Firm’s critical processes and businesses could be 
disrupted by events including cyberattacks, failure or loss 
of access to technology and/or associated data, military 
conflicts, acts of terror, natural disasters, severe weather 
events, and infectious diseases. The Firm maintains a Firmwide 
resilience program designed to provide for operational 
resilience and enable it to respond to and recover critical 
processes and supporting assets in the event of a disruption 
impacting our people, technology, facilities and third parties. 
The key elements of the Firm’s resilience program include: 
business service identification, business continuity and 
technical recovery planning, and internal testing and testing 
with critical third parties to validate recovery capability in 
accordance with business requirements. 

As part of our Firm resilience program, we maintain a Fusion 
Response team, which provides 24/7 global coverage to 
monitor and manage disruptive incidents. Furthermore, 
our three core businesses have continuity plans for critical 
business processes and essential personnel. We also plan  
and practice for extraordinary events at a sector level and 
share threat information as appropriate with peers, vendors 
and relevant government agencies.

Specialist teams support our global resilience programs 
and standards, including Technology, Risk Management, 
Information Security and Corporate Services. Dedicated 
governance and risk committees, the Operations and 
Technology Committee of our Board, and senior  
management oversee the program.

NAVIGATING GEOPOLITICAL RISKS

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent impacts  
on Europe’s energy supply put geopolitical risks top of mind 
for our business and sector. Risks associated with these 
geopolitical events include the ability to serve our clients  
and protect Firm data, as well as business interruption due  
to sanctions activity. 

Fusion Response led efforts to protect the Firm’s people 
operations and assets, and prepare for the effects of 
geopolitical risks on our business operations through its 
Significant Event Readiness process.

When reviewing risks associated with Europe’s energy  
supply, our response focused on safeguarding energy  
security where our staff live and operations take place.  
Fusion Response conducted deep-dive, country- and office-
specific analyses to further assess risks to the Firm. The 
team continues to work with regional and local management 
to monitor, assess and prepare for ongoing risks, including 
through enhanced business continuity planning activities  
and frequent intelligence summaries on energy risk trends.

COMBATING NATURAL DISASTERS

Both acute and chronic physical risks from climate change 
have the potential to impact our facilities around the world. 
Together, our Corporate Services and Fusion Response 
teams evaluate and prepare for the potential effects on  
our direct operations.

Fusion Response combines risk intelligence, event  
detection and monitoring, and cyber, crisis management 
and technology expertise to enable effective collaboration 
in managing climate-related events that could significantly 
disrupt our business. In 2022, the Fusion Response team 
monitored 84 weather and other natural hazards and reacted  
to 31 of these events, including hurricanes, wildfires, 
blizzards and earthquakes.

We most recently implemented recovery strategies in 2022 
when Category 4 Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida, 
bringing winds of up to 155 mph and 12-18 inches of rain. 
Our top concern was for our approximately 3,500 staff in the 
area, with other impacts including damage to property and 
infrastructure and widespread power and internet outages. 
Our Crisis Management team kept in touch with stakeholders 
throughout the storm and its aftermath through triage and 
impact communications, using the Firm’s Rapid Notification 
System to assess and confirm employee safety and to 
intervene and provide support through housing assistance, 
supplies and other resources, as required.

For more on how we address climate risks facing our 
business, see the Climate section.

Cybersecurity 

Our business and industry face an increasingly complex 
online threat environment. To withstand this challenge, 
we invest heavily in cybersecurity and fraud prevention 
technology and employ experienced talent to lead our 
Cybersecurity and Information Security organizations. 
The Firm’s efforts focus on helping to protect our people, 
property, products, services and brand by preserving the 
confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, 
enabling the secure delivery of client services, and protecting 
the business and the safe operation of our technology 
systems. Morgan Stanley’s Board and its Operations and 
Technology Committee oversee the Firm’s Cybersecurity  
and Information Security programs. We continually adjust  
our approach to address the evolving threat landscape  
and meet legal and regulatory expectations.

We have multiple teams in place to prepare for, respond  
to and recover from disruptive incidents and events across  
our global operations. These teams include our:

•   Information Security Incident Management and 

Investigations, which helps protect the Firm from misuse 
of sensitive information and systems by employees and 
contractors. 

•   Cyber Incident Response Team, which tracks threats 

and mitigates potential risks posed by computer security 
incidents on the Firm’s systems, providing 24/7 detection 
and response. 

•   Fusion Resilience Center, which, as previously described, 
prepares for, responds to and analyzes operational threats 
and incidents, ranging from cybersecurity, fraud and 
general technology disruptions to weather events,  
terrorist attacks, geopolitical unrest and pandemics. 

•   Fraud, Threat Hunt and Cyber Analytics teams, which  
use data science, analytics and threat hunt techniques 
to reduce the risk of Morgan Stanley assets being 
compromised, stolen or misappropriated. 

Each employee plays a valuable role in helping us manage 
cyberthreats and we maintain a robust global training 
program on cybersecurity risks and requirements. 

INDUSTRY COLLABORATION 

Collaboration across the financial services industry and  
with government agencies is critical to combating 
cyberthreats. To facilitate the exchange of threat information, 
Morgan Stanley actively engages in public-private industry 
organizations including the Financial Services Information 
Sharing and Analysis Center. We are also among eight 
founding members of the Analysis and Resilience Center,  
a nonprofit, cross-sector organization working to mitigate  
risk to critical U.S. infrastructure from existing and  
emerging threats. 

We also maintain relationships across the U.S. government. 
Morgan Stanley is a founding member of the New York 
Finance Threat Exchange, an intelligence-sharing  
partnership between the FBI and major U.S. financial  
services organizations. 

In the U.K., we are a member of the Cyber Information  
Sharing Group of industry, government and law enforcement 
partners, as well as a partner in the National Cyber Security 
Centre’s Financial Services Information Exchange. In Asia,  
we are a member of the Japan Financial Services Information 
Sharing and Analysis Center. To develop tomorrow’s cyber 
leaders and widen access to training and development, 
we partner with iMentor, Girls Who Code, NPower, local 
universities and other nonprofit organizations. Our Fusion 
Resilience Center also partners with the U.S. Marine Corps  
to provide fellowships with our cybersecurity team.

Data Protection and Client Privacy

Our business maintains physical, technical and administrative 
safeguards that help protect the confidentiality, integrity 
and availability of our clients’ information. Our global data-
protection and privacy policies and procedures govern 
the collection, storage, access, use and disclosure of such 
information. Senior leaders from our Legal and Compliance 
and Risk Management teams oversee these standards.

Morgan Stanley also informs clients and employees about 
how and why it collects personal information. For more 
information, see our Privacy Pledge.

Governance and Business Ethics  

For decades, Morgan Stanley’s strong governance and reputation for integrity have 
reduced business risk and provided a foundation for success. Our core values underpin 
this culture and drive our efforts to meet client needs, deliver value for investors, and 
help contribute to an inclusive and equitable society.

Leadership From the Top 

Morgan Stanley believes that an effective board features 
individuals with a diverse set of skills and a range of tenures. 
The Governance and Sustainability Committee and the  
Board regularly consider qualifications in the context of  
the Board’s overall composition, with a view toward 
experience in overseeing the Firm’s business and the 

challenges it faces, and toward reflecting the diversity of  
the Firm’s workforce, clients and the communities it serves.

Additional details for each director nominee are also included

Ethical Business Conduct

COMBATING CORRUPTION

As a global financial institution, our ethical standards are an 
integral part of our governance framework. We reinforce 
our focus on integrity through our Code of Conduct and 
Code of Ethics and Business, which together guide the 
day-to-day behavior of the approximately 82,000 members 
of our workforce. (See also Our Culture above). Every 
employee is required, upon hire and annually thereafter, to 
certify that they understand our Code of Conduct and will 
follow its provisions on ethical comportment. To further 
engage employees, we invite new recruits to attend culture 
events with senior leaders in each region. 

Financial crimes undermine public trust in our sector. 
We take strong measures to prevent them, including 
mandatory awareness training for employees. Robust 
risk-based policies, procedures and internal controls help 
guard against misuse of our products and services for 
money laundering, terrorism, bribery or other criminal 
activity. We require employees to report any legal or ethical 
concerns to a supervisor, our Human Resources or Legal 
and Compliance teams, or an anonymous Integrity Hotline 
operated by an independent vendor. We take allegations of 
misconduct seriously and prohibit retaliation against anyone 
raising a concern in good faith. 

We also expect our suppliers to meet our core values and 
high standards for doing business. Our Supplier Code of 
Conduct lays out our requirements for human and labor 
rights, environmental protections and ethical business 
practices. 

Morgan Stanley prohibits all forms of bribery and corruption. 
To combat such practices, we have implemented policies, 
procedures and internal controls that are reasonably 
designed to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws and 
regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our Global 
Anti-Corruption Policy, updated annually, lays out rules to 
mitigate corruption risk, and all employees receive related 
training at least once a year. We also provide additional, 
targeted training for relevant employees, and conduct 
risk-based monitoring and testing to encourage and assess 
employee compliance. For more information on our anti-
corruption program, see our Code of Conduct.

PROMOTING A HARASSMENT-FREE WORKPLACE

Morgan Stanley supports a professional work environment 
where equal opportunity, dignity and respect are prioritized. 
We expect every manager and employee to recognize 
diverse points of view, make decisions based on merit and 
lead with integrity. Our workplace policies set the tone, 
guiding employee conduct and actions. These policies 
include our Code of Conduct, Non-Discrimination and Anti-
Harassment policies, and Global Speaking Up and Reporting 
Concerns policies. We also empower our people to express 
their concerns through our confidential Integrity Hotline, 
available worldwide.

Political Activity

Morgan Stanley’s Corporate Political Activities Policy 
Statement is approved by the Board’s Governance and 
Sustainability Committee, and sets out our policies on 
U.S. political contributions, lobbying activities and trade 
association participation. In accordance with the policy,  
we prohibit corporate contributions at the U.S. federal,  
state and local levels.

Tracking toward our 2030 $1Tn Sustainable Finance Target

our Sustainable Finance Framework (the Framework).  
The Framework is maintained by the Global Sustainability 
Office, which considers the UN SDGs and industry 
frameworks and standards such as the International Capital 
Markets Association’s’ Green and Social Bond Principles 
when evaluating the Framework on an annual basis to help 
ensure alignment with evolving industry best practices. The 
Framework is further informed by input from contributing 
business units and relevant committees across the Firm in 

order to remain aligned with our Firm ESG priorities and 
changes in our business activities and products. In addition, 
the underlying data is reviewed annually by an internal 
control function. Business segments, units and programs 
contributing to the target include Investment Banking, 
Global Capital Markets, Public Finance, Securitized  
Products Group, Commodities, Investment Management, 
Wealth Management, Community Development Finance,  
the Inclusive Ventures Lab and the Morgan Stanley 
Sustainable Solutions Collaborative. Eligible themes  
and products under the Framework are shown below.

Unless otherwise noted, eligible transactions and investments 
may be either ESG-labeled (i.e., having designated use of 
proceeds or key performance indicators aligned with eligible 
themes), entity-based (i.e., transactions without a designated 
use of proceeds, but that support a client entity that has 
a significant majority of revenue or underlying activities 
from eligible themes) or specifically eligible under the U.S. 
Community Reinvestment Act. Eligible investments may  
also include strategies incorporating certain sustainable or 
impact investing criteria.

In calculating cumulative progress towards our goal, we 
reflect the full transaction value for eligible financing, 
facilitation and advisory activities, as opposed to the 
proportional value attributable to Morgan Stanley in most 
instances, in order to remain consistent with the approach 
taken since we set our initial low-carbon financing target  
in 2018. However, we reflect commitment amounts for 
term-loan and revolver-lending facilities and do not include 
transactions where Morgan Stanley served as a co-manager 

for our Global Capital Markets and Public Finance businesses. 
For all eligible investment strategies managed or distributed, 
we reflect assets under management by Morgan Stanley as 
of December 31, 2022, which include changes due to asset 
flows and market performance during the calendar year.

In 2022, we enhanced our Framework and tracking to include 
several business segments and products for the first time—
including financing of eligible term loans and revolving credit 
facilities, facilitation of ESG-labeled securitized products, 
transactions to enable retiring of verified, voluntary carbon 
offsets credits across physical products, and investments 
made by the Morgan Stanley Inclusive Ventures Lab. As 
part of enhancing our Framework in 2022, we also refined 
the eligibility criteria for investment strategies managed by 
Morgan Stanley Investment Management and distributed  
by Morgan Stanley Wealth Management to better reflect 
current Firm classifications of sustainable and low-carbon 
and green investment strategies.

2022 Sustainable Finance Transaction Highlights

€1.5Bn

Led the €1.5Bn sustainability-linked 
offering by EQT, serving as sole global 
coordinator and joint lead manager. EQT 
became the first private equity company 
globally to formalize science-based 
targets (SBTs), enabling its mission to 
make a positive impact at scale and 
accelerate climate transformation. The 
bond featured a coupon step-up linked 
to non-satisfaction of the achievement 
of 40% of eligible EQT Funds’ private and 
listed equity portfolio companies by EUR 
invested capital having set SBTs approved 
by the Science Based Targets initiative  
by 2025.

$5.1Bn

Acted as lead left bookrunner to  
Novolex’s $5.1Bn sustainability-linked 
leveraged buyout financing, the largest 
transaction of its kind to date. We worked 
with this provider of sustainable, high-
volume consumer packaging to align the 
transaction with its target of reducing 
emissions intensity by 20% by 2025 and  
by 30% by 2030.

€4Bn

Acted as active bookrunner to the  
German government’s €4Bn green bond. 
An amount equal to the net proceeds was

international cooperation; research, 
innovation and awareness raising; energy 
and industry; and agriculture, forestry, 
natural landscapes and biodiversity.  

$1.1Bn

Served as a joint placement agent of 
the $1.1Bn in primary capital raised 
via a privately placed convertible note 
offering by Northvolt, a Swedish battery 
technology company, which aims to 
deliver batteries with a significantly lower 
carbon footprint. The transaction proceeds 
will finance the expansion of battery cell 
and cathode material production in  
Europe amid soaring demand. 

$400MM

Served as a joint lead manager to  
the City of New York for its $400MM 
social bond, the net proceeds for  
which were used to reimburse spending  
on affordable housing projects. 

€260MM

Served as joint placement agent to H2 
Green Steel in its landmark €260MM 
equity raise. The Swedish firm aims 
to transform industries that generate 
significant carbon emissions, starting  
with steel through a hydrogen-powered 
steel plant in Boden.

$700MM

Acted as Joint Global Coordinator for  
New World Development's first green-
labelled perpetual and social bond 
in the Hong Kong market. New World 
Development, one of Hong Kong’s largest 
property developers, will allocate an 
amount equal to the net proceeds from 
the $700MM bond to eligible green and 
social projects such as green buildings and 
landscaping, affordable housing, socio-
economic advancement and job creation.

$10MM

Served as sole underwriter to the Family 
Forest Impact Foundation (subsidiary of 
the American Forest Foundation) for its 
$10MM green bond issued to capitalize 
the Family Forest Carbon Program, 
proceeds of which are used to make 
incentive payments to individual and family 
land-owners to participate in the U.S. 
Voluntary Carbon Offset market. Family 
Forests represent the largest portion of 
America’s forest land with over 290 million 
acres owned by individuals and families 
nationwide. The program will serve to drive 
ESG investment in nature-based climate 
change-mitigation activities.

$4.1Bn

Served as sole financial advisor to BP in 
its $4.1Bn landmark acquisition of biogas 
firm Archaea Energy. BP’s transition 
strategy includes investing in bioenergy to 
support customer decarbonization goals 
and help reduce the carbon intensity of its 
energy products. 

$200MM

Served as lead left bookrunner and 
stabilization agent to Hannon Armstrong’s 
$200MM Green Exchangeable Bond 
Offering. The U.S. company invests in 
corporate climate solutions in the energy 
efficiency, renewable energy and other 
sustainable infrastructure markets.

€1.5Bn

Served as global coordinator to Sanofi’s 
€1.5Bn dual tranche bond offering, 
including €650MM of sustainability-linked 
notes that included a target to provide

Public Finance

Morgan Stanley has been a leader in the U.S. municipal and 
not-for-profit bond market for a decade. In underwriting 
senior managed green, social and sustainability bonds,  
we have helped bring environmental and social benefits  
to communities. 

In 2022, our Public Finance Group served as underwriter 
across thematic areas including affordable housing, 
renewable energy, mass transportation, climate resiliency, 
carbon capture, sustainable water and wastewater, 
cultural institutions, and educational facilities. As part 
of this process, we worked with municipal issuers to 
enhance disclosure on green, social and sustainability bond 
transactions in line with the International Capital Market 
Association Principles and Guidelines.

Two transactions Morgan Stanley lead managed were 
recognized by Environmental Finance: Social bond of 
the year—U.S. municipal bond: The City of New York and 
Sustainability bond of the year—U.S. municipal bond: 
Preservation of Affordable Housing. During the year, we led 
affordable-housing financings in California, Connecticut, 
Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, 
Oregon and Rhode Island. We also entered new sectors, 
serving as sole manager for the first investment-grade, 
not-for-profit bond offering that solely and directly supports 
development of voluntary U.S. carbon markets on behalf of 
the Family Forest Impact Foundation. (See Highlights, on the 
previous page, for more examples.) 

Investment Banking and Global  
Capital Markets

Our Investment Banking and Global Capital Markets teams 
advise and support corporates, financial institutions, 
supranationals, sovereigns, agencies, municipalities 
and nonprofits in transactions that help them meet their 
sustainability goals. In 2022, we built on our long track record 
of issuing and supporting innovative bonds that aim to raise 
capital for positive environmental and social impact (see 
2022 Sustainable Finance Transaction Highlights above). 

Working closely with clients, we work to develop financing 
solutions for complex sustainability challenges including 
Morgan Stanley’s thematic priorities of D&I, climate and 
sustainability. Much of our work in this area also supports  
the UN SDGs. 

In 2022, our Investment Banking and Global Capital Markets 
clients joined our second annual sustainability-focused 
Financial Decision Makers Conference. Chief financial 
officers, treasurers, and heads of investor relations and 
business development were among those who heard from 
our experts on the theme “Reimagining the Future Through  
an ESG Lens.” 

CASE STUDY

SUPPORTING FIRMS WITH 
DIVERSE OWNERSHIP 

We are committed to inclusive growth that 
generates opportunity for all. Within our own 
industry, we seek to partner with and enable 
opportunities for diverse-owned firms.

As a D&I Coordinator, we act as a central point 
of contact for diverse-led underwriters and 
support their commercial success. For example, 
our Global Capital Markets team served as D&I 
Coordinator for 19 large-scale, investment-
grade bond transactions in 2022 for several 
high-profile global brands. These transactions 
included Starbucks, Amazon, American Express, 
PayPal and Meta, leading to deal allocations to 
underwriters owned by minorities, veterans  
and women.

Equities and Fixed Income

Our Equities and Fixed Income divisions provide a wide 
range of ESG-focused solutions to our institutional clients 
that span data, analytics, capital introduction, hedging 
solutions, carbon markets and structured products. In 
2022, the teams partnered with Morgan Stanley’s in-house 
Sustainable Insights Lab to develop and launch two new 
digital applications—Morgan Stanley Analytics and Portfolio 
Central. These tools will allow clients to leverage third-party 
sustainability data alongside traditional financial metrics 
during portfolio construction or pre-trade analytics.

Our Equities division continues to provide asset manager, 
asset owner and corporate clients with customized 
sustainability solutions. These activities include, but are 
not limited to, thought leadership, ESG-focused corporate 
access events, capital introduction on ESG fund launches 
and data and analytics to identify portfolio exposures. As 
one example, our Equities division has developed thematic 
sustainability baskets with the Firm’s Sustainable Insights 
Lab, which leverages third-party data to identify companies 
with sustainability-driven revenues by looking at factors 
including environmental intensity, business practices  
and social metrics. In 2022, the Equities division also 
hosted the Firm’s third annual Sustainable Alpha Forum, 
showcasing leading ESG long/short managers, and our  
7th Annual Sustainable Futures conference, in partnership 
with Morgan Stanley Equity Research. 

Morgan Stanley Fixed Income continues to expand its ESG 
capabilities and solutions. The Securitized Products Group 
(SPG) worked with global alternative investment managers 
to integrate ESG data and climate risk considerations into 
their investment framework for the management of their 
collateralized loan obligations transactions. 

The Commodities team within Fixed Income works in 
partnership with institutional and corporate clients to 
acquire exposure to and purchase renewable energy and  
environmental commodities. As carbon markets continue 
to evolve globally, Morgan Stanley is an active participant 
in the purchase and sale of carbon credits, offsets and 
renewable energy certificates, overseeing more than  
14MM MWhs of transactions in renewable assets with 
renewable energy projects and renewable-driven 
consumers of power.

Sustainability Research

Morgan Stanley Research supports ESG integration by 
using a sustainability lens to conduct investment research 
across equities and fixed income. Our Global Sustainability 
Research team leads this work, providing actionable 
information to clients in many areas, including:

•   Assessment of the interconnected impacts of climate 

change, factoring in risk of damage from weather 
extremes, impacts to the cost and availability of food,  
and loss of biodiversity. 

•   Global primers on carbon and carbon offsets to help 
investors understand the rapidly changing landscape,  
of both mandatory and voluntary markets. 

•   Analysis of regulatory developments, with timely 

analysis, forward-looking expectations and regular calls 
with experts. 

•   Partnership with the Quantitative Investment Strategies 
Research team to guide investors on how to use the Paris 
Agreement as a starting point to integrate a low-carbon tilt 
without meaningfully sacrificing performance.

•   A spotlight on the water crisis, exploring the most water-
intensive sectors and identifying global companies and 
technologies leading the way in reducing water usage. 

•   Publication of lists of enabling stocks across various 

thematic verticals like energy transition, climate 
mitigation, food, water and biodiversity. 

•   Creation of a proprietary Rate of Change framework 

identifying more than 50 stocks across Americas, Europe 
and Asia that are best-positioned to create ESG impact 
while providing significant alpha potential.

Investing with Impact Platform

Morgan Stanley was the first major financial institution 
to launch a wealth management platform dedicated to 
sustainable and impact investing. It has been a decade since 
its inception, and today the IIP has achieved widespread 
adoption across our Wealth Management Financial Advisors. 
Since the launch of the IIP, Morgan Stanley has aimed to 
consistently raise the standard in providing clients with 
innovative and holistic solutions to align their investments 
with their values.  

In 2022, client assets on the IIP totaled $68 billion.  
IIP investors can choose to advance broad sustainability 
solutions or target specific issues, such as mitigating 
climate change, supporting D&I or addressing plastic waste 
from over 310+ investment strategies across asset classes. 

We also offer additional customizable opportunities such 
as restriction overlay screening. Our 15 Morgan Stanley 
Portfolio Solutions capture the Firm’s best thinking on asset 
allocation, manager selection, portfolio construction and 
risk management in a single unified managed account. 

As the sustainable investing field expands, we continue 
to offer impact alternatives to investors. In 2022, we 
onboarded solutions across asset classes and impact 
themes, including products from diverse-owned managers. 
As of December 31, 2022, clients invested over $4Bn of 
assets in alternatives on our platform, representing over 
100% growth since 2021. 

27   Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Management Analysis team defines “diverse asset managers” as those with 33% or greater ownership by women or  

racial/ethnic diverse individuals. This definition aligns with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission categories and includes: Hispanic or Latino, 
Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander.

Morgan Stanley IQ®

Morgan Stanley IQ® is an award-winning29 and patented30 
application that empowers clients to assess their portfolios’ 
alignment to their unique impact goals. The proprietary 
application provides clients with a comprehensive menu  
of metrics, including nine impact themes and more than 
100 social and environmental impact metrics. 

The tool harnesses insights gathered from multiple third-
party data providers, as well as our own proprietary 
analytics, to assess how investments align with both 
client impact goals and global frameworks, including 
the UN SDGs. It also enables our Financial Advisors to 
find investment solutions that may better align clients’ 
portfolios with their top-priority impact goals over time. 
Clients can also take advantage of Morgan Stanley IQ® 
reporting to measure the impact of their portfolios  
across the three I’s of Impact. In 2022, we added a new 
capability to Morgan Stanley IQ® that allows clients to 
evaluate which strategies in their portfolios are managed 
by diverse-owned firms. 

In addition to impact reporting, we leverage Morgan 
Stanley IQ® analytics to power our Impact Signal 
quantitative manager scoring tool, which is used by 
Financial Advisors and their clients to quantitatively 
assess investment strategies on the strength of their 
environmental and social impact.

These resources and client-centric approach help us 
deepen relationships with existing and new clients, 
including individuals, families and institutions.

Helping Our Clients Meet Their D&I Goals

Equipping Financial Advisors

Advancing D&I and helping clients meet their D&I goals are 
top priorities for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. We 
partner with clients to mobilize capital at scale to advance 
D&I across dimensions, including race, ethnicity and 
gender. In 2022, 116 products on our IIP took an intentional 
approach to D&I investing, more than double what it was 
in 2021. Working with Wealth Management’s Diversity & 
Inclusion Investment Office, IIP offered 88 diverse-owned 
strategies, up 69% since 2021. 

Our wide-ranging efforts to advance D&I include:

•   Delivering Portfolio Solutions: Since 2021, we have 

offered clients Investing with Impact Diversity Portfolios. 
These portfolios leverage ESG criteria to advance D&I 
through products and solutions that support diverse 
communities, such as investing in low-income housing 
and inclusive corporate practices, and companies with 
leading diversity records. In addition, managers promote 
D&I issues with portfolio companies, and we work to 
advance diverse portfolio management in our industry. 
In 2022, 100% of equity managers in the Diversity 
Portfolios actively engaged with portfolio companies on 
key D&I issues. 40% and 70% of the Equity and Balanced 
Portfolios, respectively, were from diverse-owned asset 
managers and/or run by diverse portfolio managers. 

•   Leveraging Tools and Analytics: To help our Financial 
Advisors support clients’ unique D&I goals, in 2022, we 
added a filter to IIP’s product platform making it easier to 
sort the 310+ available strategies across the three I’s of 
Impact, including Inclusion. In addition, Financial Advisors 
can now sort strategies by D&I-related impact themes 
from Morgan Stanley IQ®, and by D&I Signal, our tool 
to identify asset managers who are industry leaders in 
making their firms more diverse and inclusive. Clients can 
also flag over 30 issues of concern to minimize their D&I-
related exposure, including human rights, weapons and 
pornography, and in 2022 we added a screen to assess 
portfolio exposure to private prisons. 

Enhancing Platform Governance 

In 2022, the Investing with Impact team strengthened the 
platform’s governance by appointing an Investing with 
Impact Investment Committee to provide centralized 
oversight for approving strategies on the platform and 
maintaining communication across key teams. The 
committee consists of representatives from the Global 
Investment Office, including the Investing with Impact  
team and Global Investment Manager Analysis team.

Our IIP’s growth and success are due to the quality of 
our people. The IIP team supports our Financial Advisors, 
Private Wealth Advisors, International Client Advisors and 
Institutional Consultants to better serve clients in pursuing 
their financial and impact objectives. Resources include 
an online curriculum, thematic implementation guides and 
regular updates on sustainable investing trends.

To further encourage excellence and leadership among these 
colleagues, we provide an Investing with Impact Director 
designation for impact-focused practitioners. To achieve this 
distinction, practitioners must pass an exam and demonstrate 
a track record in utilizing IIP products and solutions 
with clients, and must also meet continuing-education 
requirements. In 2022, there were 96 Investing with Impact 
Directors. We hosted our 10th annual cohort gathering, which 
consisted of an in-person event and eight virtual webinars 
spread throughout the year to educate Impact Directors on  
a variety of topics, including impact in private markets, faith-
based investing, leveraging Morgan Stanley IQ®, shareholder 
engagement, climate action and D&I.

clients in the transition to a low-carbon economy. 
Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s Financial 
Advisors, Private Wealth Advisors and Institutional

Morgan Stanley IQ®, clients can define a set of 
climate action goals and work with their Financial 
Advisors to incorporate investment products 
based on their unique objectives. As of year-end 
2022, over 35% of our IIP’s 310+ strategies aligned 
with the Climate Action investing framework.

Investment Management  

Morgan Stanley Investment Management31 provides broad-based specialization across 
a range of asset classes in public and private markets. Our independent investment 
teams leverage Morgan Stanley’s global resources to serve a diverse client base 
of governments, institutions, corporations, advisors and individuals worldwide. Our 
investment solutions include a broad range of high-conviction active strategies, 
alternatives, customization strategies and ESG expertise.

MSIM’s investment teams are responsible for developing 
their individual approaches to sustainable investing. MSIM 
believes that ESG factors can present investment risks and 
opportunities. Understanding and managing these risks  
and opportunities may therefore contribute to both risk 
mitigation and long-term investment returns. We seek to  
drive investment performance through engagement with the 
assets we own to deliver long-term value and align with our 
objective to be responsible stewards of our clients’ capital. 

MSIM is characterized by its global reach, experience 
and reputation for providing customized solutions to 
clients. We aim to create a culture that fosters investment 
diversity, innovation and independent thought. This is 
demonstrated in our investment offerings that range across 
various geographies, investment styles, asset classes and 
approaches to sustainability. We believe this can deliver 
better outcomes for clients, portfolio companies and markets, 
as each investment team will be better placed to determine 
an appropriate focus on ESG to seek to deliver increased and 
long-term value for its investment strategies and clients. 

In 2022 we also continued to advance our strategic aim to 
deliver long-term value for our clients in three main areas: 

STEWARDSHIP AND ENGAGEMENT 
Deploying shareholder rights and stakeholder guidance 
on behalf of our clients to encourage relevant, strong ESG 
practices with issuers, borrowers and counterparties, 
as appropriate. In 2022, we joined a number of new 
collaborative initiatives, such as the PRI Advance, World 
Benchmarking Alliance (WBA), Farm Animal Investment Risk 
and Return (FAIRR)and the 30% UK Club Investor Group.

SUSTAINABILITY EXPERTISE IN  
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT32 
Considering ESG factors, as appropriate, for certain MSIM 
investment strategies, asset classes and client needs. 
These efforts are supported by specialist resources in 
sustainability regulation and policy, strategic initiatives, and 
sustainability data due diligence and technology innovation.

SUSTAINABLE INVESTING SOLUTIONS
Providing our clients with investment solutions that 
are aligned with their return objectives alongside their 
sustainability preferences and needs.

portfolio managers and investment teams have access to 
support from the centralized MSIM Sustainability team and 
the Firm’s Global Sustainability Office. 

Led by MSIM’s Global Head of Sustainability, the MSIM 
Sustainability team supports MSIM’s collective sustainable 
investing and governance processes. This group works 
with the sustainability leads from our investment teams to 
coordinate global sustainable investing and stewardship 
initiatives. The MSIM Sustainability team’s activities include 
supporting investment teams in relation to incorporating 
ESG considerations into their investment approaches, 
developing sustainable products, stewardship and integrating 
sustainability data, tools and research, as required.  
MSIM’s Global Stewardship function, a part of the MSIM 
Sustainability team, supports and helps coordination of our 
MSIM proxy voting and investee engagement activities.

We recognize that the ESG landscape continues to evolve, 
so we have developed a culture of ongoing learning and 
improvement. This includes ESG knowledge-sharing across 
investment teams and client/market trends.

As active investors and active owners, we have a duty 
to be good stewards of our clients’ capital. We fulfill this 
duty by engaging with selected companies in which we 
invest, and by exercising our proxy voting and other rights 
as shareholders. These stewardship activities give us the 
opportunity to help guide companies in which we invest 
toward better ESG practices.

Our investment teams endeavor to engage in constructive 
dialogue with companies, which may encompass meetings 
and discussions on a particular issue or multiyear 
engagements/stewardship on a range of E, S or G topics 
specific to the company or asset to seek to encourage 
enhancement. On the public markets side, we exercise our 
proxy voting and other rights as shareholders.

MSIM’s Thematic Engagement Priorities focus on four 
themes, aligned with the UN SDGs, which are issues that 
may cause risk to our society and wellbeing, economy 
and/or capital markets. The priorities touch our investment 
teams to varying degrees depending on asset class, 
geography, investment style and strategy.

COLLABORATIVE ENGAGEMENTS: DIVERSITY AND 
INCLUSION AT THE FOREFRONT

The investment teams responsible for MSIM’s actively 
managed investment solutions generally find one-to-one 
discussions to be the most effective way to articulate 
views to a company’s management. However, we are 
supportive of collaborative engagement where it could 
be necessary or useful to materially enhance portfolio 
values and where we can do so in a manner that is in 
full compliance with applicable laws, regulations and 
judicial precedents. Other factors that we consider before 
participating in collaborative actions include, but are not 
limited to: potential conflicts of interest, our obligations 
under competition or antitrust laws, materiality of the issue, 
and potential for delivering tangible outcomes in relation to 
key sustainability or stewardship-related issues. These may 
include collaboration with industry peers and standard-
setting organizations, and engagement in public policy 
development in ways that seek to advance sustainable 
investing practices. Notwithstanding the adopted mode of 
collaboration, we approach collaborative engagement from 
the perspective of our role as fiduciaries of client assets, 
acting on behalf of and in the best interests of our clients.

In 2022, MSIM targeted new D&I partnerships that align 
with our fiduciary duties and client interests, and focused 
on obtaining positive outcomes. MSIM joined the 30% 
Club’s U.K. Investor Group, an investor initiative that brings 
together more than 40 investors with £11 trillion in AUM 
to drive change with companies on inclusion and diversity. 
MSIM’s International Equity team co-chairs this initiative 
alongside National Employment Savings Trust, the U.K.’s 
largest pension fund. 

This past year, MSIM also joined FAIRR, WBA and the PRI 
Advance, a stewardship initiative led by the PRI, where 
institutional investors work together to take action on 
human rights and social issues.

CASE STUDY

A RESPONSIBLE ENERGY 
TRANSITION 

The MSIM Emerging Markets Equity team believes 
that a responsible energy transition includes 
companies that enable the energy transition 
and/or companies in high-emitting sectors with 
viable and/or Paris-aligned decarbonization 
pathways. With more than 60% of global carbon 
emissions coming from emerging markets,33 the 
team believes it is important to help companies 
progress on transition pathways, rather than 
exclude those companies from the investment 
universe. Over the course of 2022, the team 
engaged with a number of companies focused 
on responsible energy, as well as those with high 
carbon emissions, to analyze the viability of and 
promote progress on transition pathways. MSIM 
encourages companies to have both long- and 
short-term feasible targets that are integrated in 
business operations, with accountable oversight at 
the board level, and carbon analysis on which to 
support and measure progress. Of the companies 
the Emerging Markets Equity team engaged 
with, they found that several metals and mining 
companies were leading on each of these metrics. 
There were other companies that were improving 
on decarbonization with feasible targets and 
plans to integrate those further into the business 
with oversight and carbon analysis. Some were 
assessed as laggards in their respective industries, 
given the lack of interim targets or integration 
planning. The team has shared best practices with 
those companies and will continue stewardship 
efforts to effectuate progress toward integration 
of transition plans.

ENGAGEMENT ACROSS THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE

PROXY VOTING STRATEGY 

MSIM engages with companies across their capital 
structure, including through our debt holdings. We 
leverage our Fixed Income platform to engage with bond 
issuers beyond listed companies, including sovereign 
states, agencies and private companies. A large number 
of these engagements primarily focus on environmental 
risks and opportunities, in particular decarbonizing 
fossil fuel intensive sectors, climate-related disclosure, 
and biodiversity and deforestation issues in sectors like 
agribusiness. We also focus on how sustainable debt 
financing can support these efforts.

Exercising our proxy voting rights enables us to guide 
portfolio companies toward improved ESG practices, which 
we believe will produce attractive returns for our clients 
over the long term. Proxy voting decisions are typically 
made in-house by members of the relevant investment 
team and the Global Stewardship team, as required.

For more information on our approach to engagement and 
proxy voting policies in 2022, see MSIM Proxy Voting Policy 
and MSIM Engagement & Stewardship Principles.

CASE STUDY

A FAIR TRIAL— INVESTOR ENGAGEMENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL 
COMPANIES ON DIVERSITY IN CLINICAL TRIALS  

Diversity in clinical trials is a significant challenge for 
pharmaceutical companies. Clinical trial efficacy is, 
to a large extent, determined by the diversity of the 
trial population. Failure to effectively incorporate a 
suitable degree of diversity in population samples 
limits understanding of the safety and effectiveness of 
new drugs and therapies. The risks that may arise from 
this are potentially severe, from product failures and 
poor health outcomes to litigation risk for companies. 
Moreover, a clinical trial is often the only way for a 
patient to gain access to the most advanced treatment, 
and so underrepresentation of certain populations may 
mean patients are excluded from potentially beneficial 
therapies for a long period of time.

In the clinical trials conducted for new drugs approved 
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 
2020, 75% of participants were white, yet over 40% 
of the entire U.S. population is made up of ethnic 
minorities.34 Meanwhile, research in 2015 uncovered  
that approximately 20% of new drugs approved in the 
six years prior demonstrated differences in exposure 
and response across racial and ethnic groups.35  

Now, regulators are taking action to address the issue. 
To tackle the challenge, the FDA published its final 
guidance in 2020 on enhancing the diversity of clinical 
trial populations.

In 2022, the International Equity team engaged with 
several pharmaceutical companies in its portfolio 
to understand how companies manage and address 
diversity in clinical trials, and ask them to embed it in 
their processes—starting with better disclosures to 
investors. Some companies have implemented  
changes, which they are preparing to disclose to 
investors. For example, one large Swiss company has 
created a Clinical Trial Diversity Program and recruited 
an experienced leader who is driving change across  
the business and created a dashboard where they  
track the makeup of trial populations, and diversity is 
now embedded into the annual bonuses of trial  
project managers. 

The International Equity team will monitor further 
company disclosures and continue to engage on  
this subject.

CASE STUDY

PRIVATE MARKETS SOLUTIONS 

The U.K. government has committed to reduce  
carbon emissions at a national level by 2050 and  
the electrification of transportation will be important 
in meeting those targets. The U.K. and European  
Union are highly supportive of electric vehicle (EV) 
adoption and many traditional auto companies  
have made major commitments to developing  
their EV manufacturing capability. However, a lack 
of EV charging infrastructure has been a significant 
hindrance to EV adoption, with $17Bn of EV  
charging infrastructure estimated to be needed in 
Europe by 203036 to meet expected demand. 

To help accelerate the adoption of EVs, the Private 
Markets Solutions team invested in the largest  
owner-operated network of rapid EV chargers in  
the U.K. (at the time of investment, June 2020). The 
company owns, operates and maintains rapid  
EV charging units capable of fully recharging most  
EVs quickly. The company also secures long-term 
leases at locations where dwell times align with 
charging times, such as gas stations, highway service 
stations and retail sites. The company maintains 
excellent availability across its portfolio, partnering 
with leading technology providers to install high-
quality chargers at key locations nationwide. 

MSIM’s investment teams incorporate the assessment of 
material ESG risks and opportunities into investment decision-
making processes, as appropriate, and according to investment 
teams’ particular investment strategies. Incorporation of such 
ESG risks and opportunities may occur at various stages of the 
investment life cycle including due diligence and research, 
valuation, asset selection, portfolio construction, and ongoing 
engagement and investment monitoring. 

APPROACHES TO CLIMATE CHANGE

Portfolio managers and investment teams may take into 
account climate-related risks and opportunities that could  
have a significant effect on value, investments and/or 
portfolios, where applicable. Approaches include, but are  
not limited to, evaluating, as applicable, the carbon footprint 
and intensity of investments as well as portfolio companies’ 
climate resiliency and adaptation strategies.

APPROACHES TO SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION SOLUTIONS 

MSIM supports efforts to advance sustainable use of natural 
resources and a circular economy. In particular, several of  
our investment strategies incorporate analysis of related  
risks and opportunities. 

CASE STUDY

CALVERT U.S. OCEAN HEALTH 
STRATEGY

The Calvert U.S. Ocean Health strategy assesses 
U.S. large-cap issuers on their efforts to address 
ocean health. Companies in the packaged foods, 
food retail and restaurant sectors are therefore 
evaluated on how they reduce plastic product 
waste, use recycled materials and replace single-
use plastic products with renewable, recyclable 
or compostable alternatives. Calvert’s research 
evaluates sector firms across the value chain—
from design and materials supply to production, 
transport, distribution and end of life. Potential 
investees are assessed based on natural capital 
impact in areas including pollution, water use, 
carbon emissions and waste management.  
This research feeds into Calvert investment 
strategies, as appropriate.

3  Sustainable Investing Solutions  

We offer clients a range of sustainable investing solutions 
from products that integrate37 ESG factors at various stages 
of the investment life cycle to sustainable-focused products 
that seek to achieve certain sustainability standards in the 
investment process (such as by meeting a minimum standard 
for inclusion, having an intentional tilt toward certain 
sustainability factors, and/or requiring a minimum allocation 
to certain thematic labelled/certified securities) to funds that 
seek to achieve attractive financial returns alongside positive 
environmental and/or social impacts. 

MSIM launched several D&I-focused investment strategies 
that are a key focus area for many of our clients and 
investors. These strategies include the impact-focused 
Morgan Stanley Next Level Fund, which invests in startups 
led by women and diverse entrepreneurs, Calvert Diversity 
Research strategies and a Morgan Stanley Institutional 
Liquidity Fund Government Securities Portfolio centered on 
purchase transactions with diverse broker-dealers.

NEW PLATFORM SUPPORTS 
CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION 

In November 2022, MSIM launched 1GT, a growth-
oriented private equity platform to invest in 
companies seeking to mitigate climate change. 
Through the collective investments it makes, the 
platform seeks to avoid or remove one gigaton 
of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions from the 
Earth’s atmosphere from the date of investment  
through 2050. 

The new platform focuses its investments on 
private companies that seek to deliver attractive 
financial returns alongside measurable positive 
environmental impacts across the mobility, power, 
sustainable food and agriculture, and circular 
economy sectors. 

The platform will seek to leverage Morgan Stanley’s 
sustainability resources to partner with portfolio 
companies. This may include monitoring ESG risks, 
reporting scopes 1-3 emissions, aligning companies 
with key trends and pursuing earnings growth, 
multiple expansion and enhanced exit potential.

37   Some investment strategies do not integrate ESG where it is not currently feasible or appropriate to do so (e.g., certain passive investment strategies,  

certain asset allocation strategies or where requested by clients).

38  This AUM figure includes funds and mandates with at least one of the following sustainability features: 1. Impact objectives, 2. Sustainability theme objectives,  

3. Tilts based on sustainability factors, 4. Low-Carbon or Net-Zero commitments. Parametric AUM is not currently included in this figure.

Community Development Finance  

Morgan Stanley helps deliver positive changes in communities across the United States. 
Our program’s track record in meeting community needs has consistently earned 
Morgan Stanley’s U.S. Banks “Outstanding” ratings from the Office of the Comptroller  
of the Currency, most recently awarded in 2022.

Our Community Development Finance (CDF) Group is a key 
driver of inclusive growth at Morgan Stanley. Designed and 
implemented with community and nonprofit partners, CDF 
executes innovative transactions not routinely performed by 
private investors in areas of pressing need, including:

•   Preservation and development of sustainable,  

multifamily, affordable rental housing 

•   Healthy communities

•   Support for service-enriched housing

•   Economic development that supports quality jobs

•   Capital for underserved, small and rural markets

•   Capacity building for nonprofits

Morgan Stanley’s $1 billion Social Bond, issued in 2020, 
accelerates this work by directing capital into affordable 
housing projects that support vulnerable communities.

2022 Community Development Finance Highlights

Keeping Housing Affordable

Responding to Natural Disasters

New construction, preservation and rehabilitation 
of affordable housing are core components of our 
community development strategy and a critical need 
across the country. CDF has continued to help alleviate 
the growing housing affordability crisis, financing over 
75 affordable housing developments for a total of ~$1.5 
billion in 2022. CDF provided a $50 million loan to support 
the renovation of the Williamsburg Houses located in 
Brooklyn, New York, consisting of 20 four-story residential 
buildings with 1,621 affordable apartments and 18 retail 
locations. As part of this transaction, residents benefited 
from rental subsidies through 20-year contracts from the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Morgan Stanley has helped meet needs after natural 
disasters in many ways, including CDF’s work to support 
community development activities in the wake of extreme 
weather events. Natural disasters, such as the California 
wildfires, can exacerbate affordable housing shortages. 
We work with locally based partners to provide financing 
that helps communities rebuild. In 2022, Morgan Stanley 
financed $43 million for the adaptive reuse and new 
construction of 90 affordable apartments in Napa, 
California. A majority of the apartments will house 
farmworker households and the formerly homeless, with 
social service coordination provided for all residents, 
including adult education programming.

Affordable Housing in Rural Markets

Capacity Building for Nonprofits 

Since the Great Recession, rural communities have faced 
an escalating housing crisis. Although rural markets have 
lower housing costs compared to metro markets, these 
areas still face persistent poverty. We seek opportunities 
to finance affordable housing and support the needs of 
residents in rural communities. In 2022, Morgan Stanley 
provided more than $17 million to build a new 54-unit 
affordable housing development in Lindsay, California, 
a small rural community. Amenities include an outdoor 
playground and picnic area, and a community building 
with a kitchen, bathrooms, computer lab and management 
offices. The design maximizes on-site recreational and 
open space, and the site offers additional supportive 
services including adult education, after-school programs 
and part-time service coordination.

As part of our inclusive growth strategy, CDF is addressing 
the need to provide additional human capital support for 
high-impact community organizations and develop the 
next generation of leaders in the community development 
field. Launched in New York City in 2012, our Community 
Development Fellows program has since expanded to Salt 
Lake City, Utah, and the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. 
The program places graduate students in school-year-
long, paid fellowships at local community organizations. 
The nonprofits receive high-quality assistance, and the 
students receive valuable experience. A high percentage 
of the participants remain in the community and economic 
development field.

Inclusive Ventures Group   

The Morgan Stanley Inclusive Ventures Group (MSIVG) works to address the significant 
market inefficiency limiting access to capital for women and ethnically diverse startup 
founders. Previously named the Multicultural Client Strategy Group, MSIVG’s innovative 
approach to bridging investment gaps focuses on changing investor attitudes and 
behaviors, accelerating growth and investing directly in early-stage, technology-
enabled companies founded by underserved entrepreneurs. Launched in 2016, MSIVG’s 
mission is to deliver strong returns and long-term value by creating a more equitable 
investment landscape.

Morgan Stanley Inclusive Ventures Lab

The Morgan Stanley Inclusive Ventures Lab (the Lab) is 
an intensive, five-month, in-house accelerator designed 
to help further develop and scale startups, culminating in 
a showcase presentation and Demo Day to the investor 
community. Morgan Stanley launched the Lab, formerly 
called the Multicultural Innovation Lab, in 2017, to address 
inequities in funding of ethnically and racially diverse  
and women-led startups. 

In 2022, we hosted our first global cohort, including 
companies from the United States and EMEA. Through  
the Lab, Morgan Stanley makes direct investments in  
early-stage, high-growth companies, and supports each  
founder's growth and development through a rigorous 
program and a global ecosystem of internal and external 
partners. The Lab provides startups in the program with 
much-needed access to investors—along with the tools, 
resources and connections to grow and thrive.

To date, 69 companies have gone through the program, 
reaching more than $730 million in combined valuation  
and raising $195 million in funding after participating in  
the Lab. Previous participants have used the platform to 
secure additional funding rounds, refine their strategy  
and expand their business—and some have been acquired. 
Following the Lab’s global expansion in 2022, the 2023 
cohort will support up to 15 companies in the U.S. and  
10 companies in EMEA.

NEXT LEVEL FUND

The Next Level Fund, established as a partnership between 
MSIVG and MSIM, makes privately negotiated equity and 
equity-related venture capital investments in primarily 
early-stage technology and technology-enabled companies 
with women or underrepresented founders as part of the 
founding team. The Next Level Fund is also backed by three 
key corporate partners: Hearst, Microsoft and Walmart. The 
targeted partnership strategy aims to improve outcomes for 
portfolio companies by providing funds and specific strategic 
expertise to accelerate business results. In 2022, the Fund 
deployed a quarter of the capital across 10 companies. Many of 
these companies were not only founded by underrepresented 
groups, but serve them as well.

Appendix 2: 2022 EEO-1 Data

Each year, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) requires all 
companies that meet specific criteria to complete an EEO-1 survey. The annual survey 
requires that a company’s U.S. employment data be categorized by race/ethnicity and 
gender in EEOC-defined job categories. 

Morgan Stanley recognizes the value of public disclosure of standardized data across 
companies and industries and, as a result, we have committed to releasing our  
U.S. EEO-1 data annually.45

Appendix 6: Operational Emissions Methodology

For the purpose of accounting and reporting GHG emissions, 
Morgan Stanley adopts the Operational Control approach 
as defined by the GHG Protocol for consolidating GHG 
emissions. Under this approach, Morgan Stanley accounts 
for 100% of the GHG emissions from operations over which 
it has operational control. This includes all owned or leased 
facilities that the company occupies, and all vehicles that 
the company owns or leases and operates. Morgan Stanley 
equity method investments, along with investment funds 
and other managed entities and their respective portfolio 
companies and assets are excluded under this boundary. 

Morgan Stanley’s base year for its GHG inventory is 
2012, the earliest year for which we had reliable data. 
The location-based results have been used as a proxy to 
calculate scope 2 market-based emissions for the 2012 base 
year as the Firm cannot calculate market-based results for 
that year. Morgan Stanley will follow the guidelines in the 
Climate Leaders Greenhouse Gas Inventory Protocol Design 
Principles (U.S. EPA, 2005) for adjusting the base year 
GHG inventory. The base year inventory will be adjusted 
in response to any structural or methodology changes, if 
the resulting adjustment is more than 5% of total base year 
emissions disclosed. Adjustments less than this threshold are 
considered insignificant and will be decided case by case.

On an annual basis, Morgan Stanley calculates the Firm’s 
GHG emissions inventory: CO2 (Carbon Dioxide), CH4 
(Methane), N2O (Nitrous Oxide), HFCs (Hydrofluorocarbons). 
The Firm currently has no emissions from PFCs, SF6, or NF3. 
Biogenic CO2e is not applicable to our business. Emissions  
of non-CO2 greenhouse gases are converted to CO2 
equivalent emissions by multiplying by the global warming 
potential (GWPs) from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report 
(AR4), IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), and EPA 
Emissions Hub 2022 (2022). 

GHG emissions are calculated using third party software,  
with factors applied based on location and emission source 
(see table below). There are exceptions for some GHG 
emission calculations, which are performed external to the 
third-party software, including scope 1 mobile combustion 
and scope 3 category 6 (business travel) emission sources 
and their related GHG emissions. Emission source activity 
and the related GHG emissions calculations that take place 
external to the third-party software have their results  
loaded into the software to maintain a single record of  
GHG emissions for all scopes.

In most instances, the most up to date emission quantification 
factors are sourced from international and national 
environmental authorities across the globe (including but not 
limited to the International Energy Agency (IEA), United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), United Kingdom 
Department for Environmental, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), 
and others) and applied to respective regions. 

To calculate the scope 1 and 2 emissions, Morgan Stanley 
gathers actual emission source activity data for all owned 
facilities and all triple-net lease facilities that Morgan Stanley 
operates and can obtain utility invoice data. For all other 
facilities where activity data is not available, Morgan Stanley 
estimates emissions by adopting the method of energy 
use intensity factors for annual emission source activity 
per square foot based on similar facilities, according to 
building type and region. Estimation intensity factors are 
held constant unless specified in a methodology change. 
Morgan Stanley may make individual exceptions if data is 
available for full-service gross leased facilities that would 
be estimated, and instead use actual data. Scope 2 market-
based emissions are calculated including the impact from 
Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) from our Virtual Power 
Purchasing Agreement and Energy Attribute Certificates 
(EACs) from renewable power systems. In the case of 
emissions from fuel cells, we obtain the produced emissions 
directly from a third-party provider.

For scope 3 category 6 (business travel) and scope 1 mobile 
combustion, travel data is collected from suppliers and 
publicly available emission factors are used to estimate 
emissions. For scope 3 category 13 (downstream leased 
assets), activity data is collected from electricity invoices 
paid. The tenant portion is determined by a submeter. 
Emissions from electricity are calculated using region-
specific emission factors. Emissions sources outside of 
purchased electricity from tenants that lease property 
from the Firm at its office facilities are de minimis and thus 
excluded from this inventory.

As data is collected, there will be instances where data may 
be missing due to delays in data availability. The third-party 
software calculates accruals for emission source activities 
for time periods of missing electricity and stationary 
fuels consumption data at the account level based on the 
respective data history.

Independent Accountant’s Review Report  

We engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”) to perform a review engagement on 
management’s assertion that the Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3, Category 6 (Business 
travel) and Scope 3, Category 13 (Downstream leased assets) Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions metrics presented within the Morgan Stanley 2022 ESG Report for the fiscal 
year ended December 31, 2022 (the “subject matter”) are presented in accordance  
with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 
(Revised Edition) published by the World Resources Institute/World Business Council  
for Sustainable Development (the “criteria”). 

Management’s Assertion

Information outside of the subject matter, including linked 
information, was not subject to Deloitte & Touche LLP’s 
review and, accordingly, Deloitte & Touche LLP does not 
express a conclusion or any form of assurance on such 
information. Further, any information relating to periods 
prior to the year ended December 31, 2022, or information 
relating to forward-looking statements, targets, goals and 
progress against goals, was not subject to Deloitte & Touche 
LLP’s review and, accordingly, Deloitte & Touche LLP does 
not express a conclusion or any form of assurance on such 
information. See Deloitte’s report starting on the next page.

Management of Morgan Stanley is responsible for the 
completeness, accuracy and validity of the subject 
matter for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. 
Management is also responsible for the collection, 
quantification and presentation of the information included 
in the 2022 ESG Report and for the selection of the 
criteria, which management believes provide an objective 
basis for measuring and reporting on the subject matter. 
Management of Morgan Stanley asserts that the subject 
matter for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, are 
presented in accordance with the criteria.

    IINNDDEEPPEENNDDEENNTT  AACCCCOOUUNNTTAANNTT’’SS  RREEPPOORRTT To Those Charged with Governance: We have reviewed the assertion of Morgan Stanley management that its Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3, Category 6 (Business travel) and Scope 3, Category 13 (Downstream leased assets) Greenhouse Gas Emissions metrics presented within the Morgan Stanley 2022 ESG Report as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (referred to as the “subject matter”) are presented in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) published by the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (the “criteria”). Morgan Stanley management is responsible for its assertion. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the subject matter based on our review.  Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the subject matter in order for it to be presented in accordance with the criteria. The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing from and are substantially less in extent than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the subject matter is presented in accordance with the criteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Because of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an examination been performed. We believe that the review evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion.  We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical requirements in accordance with the Code of Professional Conduct issued by the AICPA. We applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA and, accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In performing our review, we performed analytical procedures, inquiries, and other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. For a selection of the subject matter, we performed tests of mathematical accuracy of computations, compared the specified information to underlying records, or observed the data collection process.  The preparation of the subject matter included within the Morgan Stanley 2022 ESG Report requires management to interpret the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported information. Measurement of certain amounts and metrics may include estimates and assumptions that are subject to substantial inherent measurement uncertainty, including for example, the accuracy and precision of conversion factors or estimation methodologies used by management. Obtaining sufficient appropriate review evidence to support our conclusion does not reduce the inherent uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. The selection by management of a different but acceptable measurement method, input data, or model assumptions, may have resulted in materially different amounts and metrics being reported.

DISCLOSURES

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements herein, including expectations related to targets, 
goals or objectives such as financed emissions targets, representation 
objectives and the achievement thereof, may be “forward-looking 
statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the 
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are 
not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead 
are based on management’s current expectations and are subject 
to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These statements are 
not guarantees of future results or occurrences and involve certain 
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are 
difficult to predict and are often beyond our control. In addition, this 
report contains statements based on hypothetical scenarios and 
assumptions, which may not occur or differ significantly from actual 
events, and these statements should not necessarily be viewed as 
being representative of current or actual risk or forecasts of expected 
risk. Actual results and financial conditions may differ materially 
from those included in these statements due to a variety of factors, 
including, among others, global socio-demographic and economic 
trends; energy prices; technological innovations; climate-related 
conditions and weather events; counterparty and client behavior and 
financial health; insurance applicability, legislative and regulatory 
changes; our ability to retain and attract qualified employees in a 
competitive environment for talent; and other unforeseen events or 
conditions, and the precautionary statements included in this report 
and those contained in Morgan Stanley’s periodic filings with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).

Certain forward-looking statements included in this report are 
also based on assumptions, standards, metrics, methodologies 
and frameworks for measurement, reporting and analysis of 
climate change that continue to evolve, vary across jurisdictions 
and regulatory bodies and are the subject of proposed regulatory 
changes in multiple jurisdictions, which may have a material impact 
on our future measurement and reporting, as well as the results of  
the efforts set forth in this report.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Morgan 
Stanley speak only as to the date they are made, and Morgan Stanley 
does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect 
the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the 
forward-looking statements were made. In addition, information 
within this report may be presented from a different perspective or 
in more detail than disclosures mandated by our global regulators. 
In particular, while the foregoing discussion describes potential 
future events that may be significant or material (based on disclosure 
recommendations and broader definitions of materiality used by 
certain voluntary external frameworks and reporting guidelines or 
those in non-U.S. jurisdictions), the significance or materiality of those 
potential events should not be read as equating to materiality as the 
concept is used in Morgan Stanley’s periodic filings with the SEC 
under the Exchange Act.

USE OF THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION

No reports, documents or websites that are cited or referred to in 
this report shall be deemed to form part of this report. In addition, 
certain information contained in this report has been derived from 
publicly available information released by third-party sources, which 
Morgan Stanley believes to be reasonable, although Morgan Stanley 
has only been able to complete limited validation. Third-party 
climate information may not reflect the latest or most accurate data. 
Additionally, in the absence of company-specific emissions data, 

some financed emissions will be estimated using emissions and 
activity factors provided by third-party sources. Certain third-party 
information, such as scope 3 emissions and emissions factors, may 
change over time as methodologies evolve and are refined or current 
data changes or is restated or new data is added. These and other 
factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed  
in the estimates and beliefs made by third parties and by 
Morgan Stanley.

OTHER DISCLOSURES

This report is provided for informational purposes only and is not 
intended as advertising, or marketing material, or as a recommendation 
to purchase any asset, product or service. There is no assurance that 
goals or targets stated in this report (including interim targets) will 
be achieved or result in positive measurable outcomes. Information 
contained in this report, including commitments, goals, targets 
and objectives, and their related frameworks, methodologies or 
approaches, are subject to change without notice. 

Individual funds and client accounts may have specific environmental, 
social and governance (ESG)-related goals and restrictions that affect 
ESG integration. Please refer to governing documents of individual 
vehicles to understand their binding ESG criteria. 

ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or ESG factors 
could result in relative investment performance deviating from other 
strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such 
sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, 
there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable 
investment performance.

The case study examples are provided for illustrative purposes only. 
There is no assurance that the engagements will be successful and/or 
result in positive investment outcomes.

We believe Morgan Stanley’s robust governance and business practices help foster client and stakeholder trust, and provide a foundation for success.

ESG governance, encompassing our diversity and inclusion, climate, and sustainability efforts, starts with leadership from the top and is embedded in committees across the Firm.

Morgan Stanley board of directors (Board) committees have explicit oversight responsibilities for D I, climate and sustainability.

The Governance and Sustainability Committee, which was previously the Nominating and Governance Committee, has overseen ESG initiatives for several years.

The Compensation, Management, Development and Succession (CMDS) Committee assists the Board in its oversight of strategies, policies and practices related to human capital, including diversity and inclusion.

The Audit Committee oversees the Firm’s voluntary public sustainability and climate disclosures.

The full Board is briefed on topics across each theme, as appropriate.

In 2022, Morgan Stanley worked to enhance Firmwide ESG governance, by formalizing and standardizing the ESG organization structure (see ESG Governance Framework graphic on the prior page).

We created or modified existing regional and business unit level committees to help ensure consistency in membership, structure and reporting lines.

These ESG related committees now report to the Firm ESG Committee, which oversees Firmwide ESG strategy, and to the Climate Risk Committee with respect to climate risk related matters.

In addition, ESG disclosure matters are reviewed by the ESG Disclosure Committee, with certain climate disclosures also reviewed by the Climate Risk Committee.

Scholars interested in financial services will be introduced to careers at Morgan Stanley through our campus career offerings, and Scholars interested in other careers are connected with Morgan Stanley employees similar with career backgrounds or networks outside the Firm.

Morgan Stanley welcomed 30 Scholars from the first and second cohorts of the program to New York City in September 2022 to engage with senior leaders and learn about our business.

During a day spent at our Firm headquarters, the Scholars heard directly from Chairman and CEO James Gorman, Chief Human Resources Officer Mandell Crawley and Global Head of Talent Susan Reid.

Scholars tuned in to panels featuring Morgan Stanley employees who are HBCU alumni, who discussed their paths from college to a career in financial services.

I wouldn’t be at Spelman College or any college at all without this scholarship.

I hope to take advantage of this opportunity to grow as a student and create a life that I’ve never seen anyone around me live.

To help underserved communities thrive, we partner with organizations, small businesses and suppliers to help address gaps in funding and access for diverse businesses.

Our Firm’s investments in diverse startups and entrepreneurs can be found in the Solutions and Services section.

Our Supplier Diversity Program seeks out diverse led businesses, including those owned by ethnically diverse individuals, women, veterans, people with disabilities and members of the LGBT community to supply hundreds of our offices worldwide.

This diverse vendor base helps provide opportunities to underrepresented business owners and to support the communities where we operate.

Supplier diversity guiding principles support the continued broadening of our supplier pool.

With these practices, we train our sourcing professionals maintain a supplier database with vendor diversity certifications and include specific supplier diversity language in both our Global Procedures for Supplier Selection and Engagement and Supplier Code of Conduct.

We review our diverse supplier engagements quarterly and annually to identify opportunities to expand both the number of diverse suppliers and the spend with them.

To reinforce sourcing excellence in this area, we award Supplier Diversity Champions annually, an accolade recognizing those who significantly exceed expectations as measured against our guiding principles for supplier diversity.

Barriers and resource constraints often prevent small businesses from gaining a foothold in the marketplace, causing a gap between available opportunities and diverse suppliers.

In partnership with the Institute for Inclusion, the Small Business Academy helps bridge this gap by equipping entrepreneurs with the expertise they need to win business with financial services firms and other sectors.

Launched in 2022, the Academy empowers diverse owned small business leaders through education, sharing of best practices and mentorship.

The Academy, a partnership between our Supplier Diversity Program and the Institute for Inclusion, helps diverse owned U.S. and U.K. small businesses stand out in the procurement process, strengthen their business knowledge and build their professional network.

The 12 week virtual, instructor facilitated program includes interactive workshops, coaching sessions and a capstone project.

Graduate firms receive 12 months of ongoing support from a Morgan Stanley mentor and the opportunity to access grants to fuel their growth.

Ten diverse owned small businesses participated in our first cohort.

Each of the areas of our business drives D I initiatives within their areas of focus.

JumpStart Scholars in Finance: The Morgan Stanley JumpStart Scholars, a partnership with Leadership, Education and Development (LEAD) in Finance initiative, provides financial access, programming and mentoring for diverse high school students throughout the United States.

The five month program offers an eight course curriculum to broaden participants’ career opportunities and encourage proactive financial planning.

Analysts and associates across Institutional Securities engage directly with student participants.

The program culminates in a capstone competition where scholar teams re create a deal scenario from our Global Capital Markets division.

Women’s Mentoring Circles: Focusing on the development of women vice presidents, senior associates, associates and analysts within our Investment Management business, Women’s Mentoring Circles provide the support and space needed to discuss topics relevant and important to women in the financial services industry.

This six month program covers topics including Authentic and Inclusive Leadership, Career Advancement, and Personal Branding, with each circle consisting of five mentees and two mentors at the executive director level.

Project Elevate: In partnership with PeopleShores, a public benefit company empowering underserved communities in the U.S. with digital skills and corporate job opportunities, Project Elevate is working to educate, employ and empower experienced diverse talent.

The program provides participants with six months of training and a one year consultancy, with Morgan Stanley having the opportunity to convert participants into full time employees upon program completion.

This program engages a pipeline of talent from a range of educational, ethnic and social backgrounds.

The Equity Collective: In February of 2022, Morgan Stanley launched the Equity Collective (the EQC), a group of Wealth and Asset Management firms that have committed to educating, empowering and developing the next generation of diverse leaders in the finance industry.

The EQC has led more than 100 events, engaging with students through partners at Boys Girls Clubs of America, hellohive and Team IMPACT.

The EQC supported the rewrite of Boys Girls Clubs of America’s Career Launch curriculum, the organization’s premier job readiness and career preparation program for teens ages 13 18.

In collaboration with hellohive, a virtual recruiting platform focused on diverse talent, the EQC hosted an immersive virtual program for over 500 students from more than 150 colleges, offering students access to internships and job openings from participating firms.

The EQC worked with Team IMPACT to build relationships with universities and colleges across the country, allowing Team IMPACT to continue to match children facing serious illnesses and disability with college sports teams.

The growing impacts of climate change underscore the importance of working to reduce emissions.

Morgan Stanley leverages its expertise to help clients decarbonize, supporting the global economy’s transition to a more sustainable future.

We also invest in resource efficiency and renewable energy for our own operations.

As Chief Sustainability Officer and CEO of the Institute for Sustainable Investing, I am proud of Morgan Stanley’s ambition to reach net zero financed emissions by 2050.

We were the first major U.S. bank to make this commitment, and we built on it in 2021 by announcing interim 2030 financed emissions reductions targets for energy, power and auto manufacturing.

We are also committed to mobilizing 750 billion to support low carbon and green solutions by 2030.

To achieve these goals, we recognize how important it is to operationalize our commitments in a way that balances the need to rapidly decarbonize the global economy with the real world circumstances acutely affecting individuals and communities.

That is why we consider climate as part of our overall business strategy and approach to risk management.

It is also why I co chair Morgan Stanley’s Climate Risk Committee, which is focused on overseeing climate risk considerations throughout Firm processes.

Morgan Stanley is in a unique position to support the climate transition and, looking to the future, I am excited to continue to work with clients and colleagues to meet our commitments in support of a fair and just transition.

Morgan Stanley is committed to considering climate change throughout our business, operational and risk management activities.

To support this work, we have a four pillar climate strategy, with the overall goal of achieving net zero financed emissions15 by 2050.

We seek to support the transition to a low carbon economy with a public commitment set in 2021 to mobilize 750 billion in capital toward low carbon and green solutions by 2030.

We manage climate risk by integrating climate change considerations across risk management processes and governance structures.

In our operations, we strive to minimize our emissions footprint and enhance our climate resiliency.

The strength of our commitment is demonstrated by our achievement of carbon neutrality across our global operations in 2022.

We are committed to transparency and communicate our efforts and resulting progress through our climate related disclosures.

Launched Climate Strategy Assessment Framework (CSAF) to understand our clients’ transition plans and commitments integrated into the Firm’s risk management and governance processes under the Chief Risk Officer.

Only major U.S. headquartered by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors global financial services firm on the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) Steering Committee accounting for approximately 50% of Morgan Stanley’s global energy consumption.

Renewable electricity attributes account for 100% of global operational electricity in 2022.

Financed emissions are the absolute greenhouse gas emissions attributed to banks through their loans and investments.

Our Approach to the Net Zero Transition Morgan Stanley is committed to achieving net zero financed emissions by 2050 and contributing to the decarbonization of the real economy.

Effective action on climate change requires a broad transformation across sectors and economies, and management of impacts to workers and communities.

We also recognize the need to balance the urgency of the calls to action with the realities of the social, economic and geopolitical landscape, and see that our clients are balancing the same concerns.

We recognize that our path to achieving net zero financed emissions from our lending activities, including our interim 2030 targets for the Auto Manufacturing, Energy and Power sectors, will not be a straight line.

Our clients are at different stages of setting their own targets, developing plans to diversify and, in some cases, transform their business models.

While we understand the need to reduce emissions quickly, we are also aware of the unintended consequences of withdrawing capital from transitioning sectors.

We support an orderly transition and therefore accept that, in some cases, lending to companies that are transitioning may result in our financed emissions increasing in the short term or over certain periods.

However, we believe that this support will ultimately facilitate the transition to a sustainable and lower carbon future.

Our approach to meeting our climate commitments is described below.

As we continue to develop this approach, we will utilize frameworks including the Glasgow Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) transition planning guidance to help inform our approach.

Please see Climate Strategy: Looking Ahead and Approach to Transition Index for more detail.

Morgan Stanley has long been focused on financing and facilitating the low carbon transition.

Our Firm’s solutions will help commercialize and deploy new and existing technologies necessary for the global economy, and our clients, to significantly decarbonize.

Our expertise also enables clients to capitalize on policy actions and market trends developing around the globe.

By scaling low carbon solutions that reduce our clients’ greenhouse gas (GHG) footprints, we expect to reduce our own financed emissions and make further headway toward our targets.

Our work with clients to scale low carbon opportunities is a key component of our commitment to mobilize 750 billion to support low carbon and green solutions by 2030.

See recent examples of this work in the Solutions and Services section.

Morgan Stanley aims to meet our climate commitments and contribute to real economy decarbonization by supporting our clients in achieving their own climate related commitments.

Many of our clients will require capital and expertise to achieve their targets and ensure their business strategies are resilient in a decarbonizing economy.

Our clients also face complexities as they transition, and Morgan Stanley is committed to working with them at all stages of their climate journeys.

We seek to work closely with our clients to understand and assess their low carbon transition plans, the resourcing of their plans and how these plans align with our own climate related commitments.

Educating our own bankers is also a critical part of this strategy.

In 2022, we hosted ESG training sessions for relevant banking and capital markets employees on environmental and social commitments and policies, as well as the related due diligence and governance processes.

We will continue to provide guidance going forward to educate and equip our client facing teams with the knowledge to make climate informed decisions.

In 2022, we began to develop a new Climate Strategy Assessment Framework (CSAF) that provides additional insight into our clients’ approaches to climate.

The CSAF will leverage data from public sources and client discussions to help us understand our clients’ transition plans and climate commitments.

It will help us assess company targets, climate governance, plans and actions taken toward meeting targets, and GHG emissions performance.

The framework will inform client diligence practices and will also help us focus on our client engagement discussions.

There will be an initial focus on companies in the sectors covered by our interim 2030 targets, with an aim to cover more companies over time as we announce additional sector targets.

This new tool will deepen our understanding of clients’ climate plans and help us assess the robustness of our clients’ commitments and the resources they are dedicating to the transition.

As data improves over time, and as publishing transition plans become more widely adopted, we expect this information will help enhance our analysis framework and process.

We understand that over time there may be clients who cannot transition in a timely manner.

We also recognize that there may be a period of time, while our clients plan and implement their strategies, before we are able to see GHG emissions reductions.

However, our engagement approach with clients as they transition is not indefinite.

We intend to increase focus on how portfolio lending decisions affect the progress toward our targets, and we take that into account as we drive our strategy.

We will continue to work with our clients on their transition strategies and consider their approaches to climate as we make portfolio lending decisions to meet our 2030 interim net zero targets.

We have rolled out the following review processes to monitor progress toward 2030 interim net zero targets.

Business Unit Reviews for our interim target sectors, which evaluate new lending opportunities through the lens of the impact on progress toward our targets, taking into account annual client emissions.

Oversight Committee (EOC) will conduct regular reviews of the Firm’s progress toward meeting our interim targets.

In September 2020, Morgan Stanley became the first major U.S. headquartered global financial services firm to commit to achieving net zero financed emissions by 2050.

In November 2021, we announced 2030 interim financed emissions targets to guide our lending activities based on credible science aligned emission pathways.

These targets focus on emissions intensive sectors in our corporate lending portfolio Auto Manufacturing, Energy and Power.

In July 2022, we published our 2019 baseline GHG emissions from lending activities for each interim target sector.

Together, both developments mark an important start toward our 2050 commitment to net zero financed emissions.

Morgan Stanley is currently the only major U.S. headquartered global financial services firm on the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) Steering Committee, and is both a founding member and a member of the steering group of the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). The frameworks and methodologies of these two expert organizations help inform our thinking around setting climate related targets and measuring our progress.

We value our leadership in these initiatives that help inform our approach to net zero and we continue to make our own independent decisions regarding our climate strategy.

Table A.4: CO2 Emissions, Oil Natural Gas (sum of rows 4 and 5).

Figure 2.3: Global net CO2 emissions by sector, and gross and net CO2 emissions in the Net Zero Emissions (Electricity Sector).

In our approach to net zero and related interim targets, we are guided by a three part framework to measure, manage and report financed emissions, as shown below.

While it is important for us to consider industry best practice, we make our own independent decisions regarding our climate strategy.

High quality offsets can help address hard to abate emissions that cannot first be mitigated by existing technologies or operational changes.

We believe carbon offsets will play a critical role in helping the real economy achieve net zero emissions, particularly in the near term, as new decarbonization technologies develop sufficient maturity and scale.

Morgan Stanley acknowledges that the growing yet nascent voluntary carbon market continues to offer opportunities for real economy participants to offset emissions they are responsible for.

As we work with clients who seek to reduce their emissions footprint, understanding the quality of client procured offsets, as well as their usage compared to achieving real, underlying emissions reductions, will be points of consideration.

Morgan Stanley will not buy offsets to directly reduce our financed emissions.

For our approach on offsets relating to achieving our own operational carbon neutrality, please see here.

Given our commitment to supporting the low carbon transition, it is important to equip our employees with resources and education on how climate change impacts the Firm and our clients from a business perspective.

We created an in house platform for staff to learn the information necessary to make well informed, climate related business decisions in a rapidly shifting global landscape.

The online platform provides a suite of trainings, tools and resources, including a core curriculum that focuses on climate change fundamentals, risks and opportunities.

These learning modules are complemented by a speaker series in which experts from inside and beyond the Firm provide relevant and timely insights on topics ranging from climate policy to technological solutions.

Recent examples include a webinar on the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act from the president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) and an overview of the carbon markets from the Morgan Stanley commodities desk.

Our Global Sustainability Office also distributes a regular brief on climate news and topics to help ensure employees are up to date with the latest developments.

Informing Climate Policy Morgan Stanley supports the Paris Agreement and recognizes the importance of global policy action to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

As a financial firm with global reach, we recognize that we have a role to play in engaging with national and global climate policies that support an orderly transition to a low carbon economy.

We support science aligned and, where possible, market based policies, including a price on carbon, and engage with policymakers, industry groups and trade associations to promote effective global and national climate policies.

Further policy will be required to help achieve net zero by 2050, and help mobilize the capital required to get there.

We work with our leading trade associations to promote positions that support common sense and cost effective climate policy.

These associations include the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the Financial Services Forum, the American Bankers Association, the Bank Policy Institute and the Institute of International Finance, among others.

A list of the principal U.S. trade associations of which Morgan Stanley is a member can be found here.

Our participation in trade associations helps further Morgan Stanley’s work as a global financial services firm however, it does not imply that we always align with their positions on all aspects of climate policy.

We provide our independent view as members and seek alignment where feasible and appropriate.

In addition, we seek to actively participate as a member of various climate focused working groups.

For example, we are part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Climate Action Task Force, as well as the Climate Solutions Working Group, an external group composed of Chamber members who want to see the Chamber more proactively support decarbonization policies.

As part of these activities, we engage with the Chamber in constructive dialogue to share our perspective.

The climate focused trade organization working groups of which we are a member are listed below.

Morgan Stanley is a member of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions’ Business Environmental Leadership Council the largest U.S. based group of corporations focused on addressing climate challenges and supporting climate policy.

In 2022, we engaged in the Council’s policy priority development process and invited C2ES leadership to speak about the business potential of the Inflation Reduction Act in an educational event for employees.

In 2022, policymakers globally were engaged in defining climate disclosure regulations and took steps toward implementation.

We engaged in advocacy through our industry groups to inform and further refine the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation’s draft sustainability reporting standards and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposed rule to enhance and standardize climate related disclosures for investors.

We engaged with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury climate leadership on ESG data as it relates to target setting and financial institution decarbonization strategies.

In the European Union (EU), we regularly engage with the European Commission, Council and Parliament on the development of ESG regulations.

Topics include the development of due diligence reporting requirements, corporate sustainability reporting requirements and the creation of an EU green bond standard, among others.

In the U.K., we work with policymakers and provide commentary on the development of a range of legislative and policy documents, including the U.K.’s green finance strategy, disclosure requirements and the development of the green taxonomy.

Achieving Carbon Neutral Operations In 2022, we achieved our commitment to carbon neutrality across our global operations.

Our carbon neutrality status20 covers direct scope 1 emissions from our operations, scope 2 location based emissions from purchasing energy and scope 3 emissions from business travel and downstream leased assets.

Reducing our energy use through efficiencies in our real estate by employing projects across our infrastructure.

As of year end 2022, our global GHG emissions (from locations based accounting) have been reduced by 41% from a 2012 baseline.

We have achieved this reduction while increasing the number of employees by 43%, with approximately the same overall square footage.

Securing a virtual power purchase agreement for a wind based power system accounting for approximately 50% of Morgan Stanley’s annual global electricity consumption.

The 93 megawatt Bennington Wind Project in Illinois achieved operational completion in November 2021.

The Firm manages offtake of both power and renewable energy certificates (RECs) from the wind farm, retiring RECs to offset emissions from our North America electricity consumption.

Purchasing carbon offsets to compensate for our remaining emissions, in accordance with the following strategy:.

Our carbon offset portfolio follows a governance process.

Contracting directly for renewable electricity and buying to help ensure quality and credibility.

We neutralized the remainder of our electricity related emissions through a mix of on site renewable power generation, green power purchase agreements and unbundled RECs.

We seek to accelerate the global renewable energy market by purchasing RECs in countries where we have real estate and where REC markets exist.

Our strategy focuses on removing carbon from the atmosphere, with removal credits accounting for approximately 70% of our portfolio in 2022.

All selected projects are certified by an internationally recognized carbon standard.

We pursue projects that deliver benefits supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).

For example, an afforestation project in Uruguay, selected in consultation with our Commodities group, plants native tree species and converts degraded land into biodiverse forest.

We remain committed to pursuing high quality offsets and explore the use of offset purchases to spur development in new technology.

This is a management determined metric that may be viewed or calculated differently by others who may use the same carbon neutral terminology.

Morgan Stanley has determined that the boundary around our carbon neutrality status is scope 1, scope 2 location based emissions, scope 3 business travel and downstream leased assets, carbon offsets purchased from the voluntary carbon market, green power contracts, and market instruments (e.g.

Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs)).

There are instances where green power contracts and instruments that we accept for our purposes to meet carbon neutrality do not align with the criteria required to reflect those purchases in our scope 2 market based figure in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) ( GHG Protocol ).

For our GHG emissions table aligned with the GHG protocol, please see here.

Climate Strategy: Looking Ahead Morgan Stanley’s climate strategy will continue to evolve alongside developments in science, technology and regulation.

Similarly, our approach to our net zero commitment will be iterative as methodologies, frameworks and climate data improve over time.

In this report, we included our first Approach to Transition Index outlining the actions we take to advance our net zero strategy and accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy.

We will continue to monitor developments in methodologies, frameworks and guidance, and our future disclosures will reflect updates to our net zero strategy.

Develop a transition plan that we will continue to evaluate and advance as methodologies, guidance and regulations continue to evolve.

Set new sector targets that increase the scope of financed emissions covered, including with respect to capital markets facilitation activities once PCAF’s guidance and related methodology are finalized.

Reassess our interim targets and related metrics and consider alternative approaches to help ensure that we have the appropriate guideposts to achieve our 2050 net zero goal.

Continue to enhance our CSAF framework as a tool to engage with clients on their transition plans, tailor climate solutions, and assist with understanding and addressing transition risk in our lending business.

Expand climate focused education for Morgan Stanley employees to ensure they are best equipped to help clients on their transition journey.

Update the Firm’s long term climate scenario narratives and expand in house capabilities including qualitative and quantitative assessment techniques (see pages 24 25 of our 2021 Climate Report for more information).

We also plan to expand their use to help inform risk and opportunity identification.

Climate change poses a significant risk to the global financial system and, in turn, the stability of economies globally.

The impacts of climate change range in nature, severity and frequency, and therefore it is critical for financial institutions to understand how such impacts may affect their business and clients.

Firm Risk Management (FRM), in partnership with other areas of the Firm, continues to focus on identifying and managing risks related to climate change to limit their potential impact to Morgan Stanley.

As informed by the TCFD, as well as various non governmental organizations, regulators and financial institutions, Morgan Stanley categorizes the risks associated with climate change into two groups: transition risks and physical risks.

Depending on the nature, speed and breadth of these changes, transition risks may pose varying degrees of financial, reputational, regulatory, compliance and other risk to Morgan Stanley as well as our clients or third parties on which we rely.

Over the longer term, negative impacts of transition risks on certain of our clients, such as decreased profitability and stranded assets, could lead to increased credit and counter party risk to us.

The impacts of these and other transition risks could increase our expenses and adversely impact our strategies, including by limiting our ability to pursue certain business activities or offer certain products and services.

Physical Risks: The physical impacts of climate change include harm to people and property arising from acute climate related events such as hurricanes, heatwaves, floods or wildfire, and chronic, longer term shifts in climate patterns, such as higher average temperatures, rising sea levels and long term drought.

Such events could disrupt our operations or those of our clients or third parties on which we rely, including through direct damage to physical assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility.

Over the longer term, these events could impact the ability of certain of our clients or customers to repay their obligations, reduce the value of collateral, limit insurance coverage and result in other effects.

Morgan Stanley continues to expand its capabilities for identifying and managing the risks associated with climate change for the benefit of our clients, employees and shareholders.

To that end, Firm Risk Management (FRM) is responsible for overseeing the management of Morgan Stanley’s climate related financial risks.

In 2022, FRM established a Central Climate Risk Team, which is responsible for working with stakeholders in FRM and across the Firm to identify, monitor, mitigate and report on the climate related financial risks that the Firm may face.

Given the global nature of climate risk, the Central Climate Risk Team includes members in regions around the world where Morgan Stanley has a significant presence, including the Americas, EMEA and APAC.

Morgan Stanley views climate risk not as a stand alone risk type, but as an overarching risk that can impact other risk types, such as Credit Risk, Market Risk, Operational Risk and Liquidity Risk.

As climate risk is interconnected with other risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management strategies and governance structures.

The table below describes the risk types overseen by FRM and the means by which they may be impacted by climate risks.

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio owned by us.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to finance its operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating its assets.

Such risks include the Firm’s ability or perceived ability to meet its financial obligations in a timely manner.

Liquidity risk encompasses the associated funding risk triggered by stress events, which may negatively affect the Firm’s liquidity and may impact its ability to raise new funding.

Cash flow source of repayment c. Business model strategy a.

Mortgage backed securities prices c. Commodity prices and volatilities a.

Risk resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or external events (e.g., fraud, theft, compliance, cyberattacks or damage to physical assets) which could adversely affect our business or reputation.

Morgan Stanley manages climate risk through the application of its standard risk management framework.

The first step in managing climate risk requires correct identification of the climate risks that may impact Morgan Stanley’s products, business lines and physical footprint.

As with other types of risk identification, climate risk identification is critical to the measurement, monitoring and mitigation of financial risks to Morgan Stanley.

Scenario analysis utilizes a variety of approaches to identify potential vulnerabilities in our business and to measure the resulting impact.

We leverage Morgan Stanley’s internal risk inventory and materiality assessments to inform the design of our climate scenarios, which emphasize either transition risk or physical risk.

Morgan Stanley monitors external developments and tracks the latest science to understand the climate risks posed to the Firm.

FRM continues to evolve its centralized risk identification inventory to identify appropriate climate related risks.

Transition risk scenario analysis helps Morgan Stanley understand how a move to a low carbon economy may create financial risks to the Firm.

Morgan Stanley leverages regulatory scenarios and scenarios from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) for guidance and best practices when designing transition risk scenarios.

Transition risk scenarios are chosen based on the Firm’s risk profile, emerging changes in policies (such as carbon pricing) and the potential economic impact of such policy changes.

Scenarios may be conducted for different time horizons and consider exposure concentrations by sector and industry.

To conduct the analysis, FRM leverages existing economic scenario forecast models as a starting point to develop climate scenario forecasts.

This approach allows FRM to capture key macroeconomic and financial market variables across regions and sectors.

Climate specific variables are then taken from widely recognized industry sources such as NGFS, or through input from Morgan Stanley Research.

These variables are then incorporated into the macroeconomic scenarios.

Physical risk scenario analysis helps Morgan Stanley understand the potential impact that acute or chronic weather events could have on the business.

Physical risk scenarios leverage internal inputs and models and adjust them for climate specific factors based on the scenario narrative.

The scenarios in focus are determined by material risks identified through the risk identification and materiality assessment processes.

Morgan Stanley has analyzed the potential financial consequences of climate events of varying impact, including acute events such as violent weather.

The portfolios in scope are generally those we have identified as having concentrations in geographies impacted by the physical risk being analyzed, including our corporates, commodities and real estate portfolios.

In addition, Morgan Stanley’s Operational Risk Department runs scenarios to assess and quantify potential losses that Morgan Stanley may incur as a result of climate related physical risks.

Supported by our Fusion Resilience Center, which researches the potential threats to operations, the Operational Risk Department identifies and ranks the key physical risks for each of our main office locations.

The physical risks are assessed in terms of damages to Morgan Stanley’s physical assets as well as incremental losses incurred to maintain operations.

As part of the assessment, the scenarios consider the potential occurrence of unprecedented catastrophic events caused by climate change.

Both transition and physical risks can materialize over different time horizons.

For example, episodic extreme hurricanes present near term physical risks to vulnerable regions and populations, while transition risk measures, such as carbon taxes, present longer term challenges as economies adjust to increased costs and market or technological changes stemming from new tax policy.

Institutions, such as Morgan Stanley, therefore face the challenge of not only identifying material climate risks to their business, but also analyzing the likely duration and trajectory of each physical and transition risk they face.

We maintain a robust governance process to regularly communicate climate risk updates to key internal stakeholders and committees.

This process ensures appropriate oversight and transparency.

With respect to the process, there are several committees that exclusively focus on climate risk.

The Climate Risk Committee (CRC) reports to the Firm Risk Committee and subsequently the Board Risk Committee, and oversees matters relating to the Firm’s financial and non financial exposure to climate risk, including monitoring the Firm’s climate related commitments, and reviewing and or approving certain emissions related matters.

As the primary climate risk committee, the CRC oversees a number of subcommittees, which between them are responsible for reviewing climate risk related matters within FRM and approving certain emissions related matters.

The CRC also receives reports from a number of Business Unit and regional ESG committees on climate risk related matters, as reflected in ESG Governance here.

Metrics and targets help track our efforts to achieve our net zero commitment, and are important across all four pillars of our climate strategy.

We measure progress against our interim net zero targets which are based on our financed emissions lending intensity (FELI) metric.

For an in depth explanation of this metric, please see the Methodology for Morgan Stanley’s 2030 Interim Financed Emissions Targets on the Path to Net Zero.

We announced our 2030 interim emission reduction targets in late 2021 and set our emissions baseline year as 2019.

On page 55, we disclose our financed emissions lending intensity (FELI) for 2019, 2020 and 2021 (for more detail on our 2019 baseline emissions data, see our 2021 Climate Report).

It is important to note that these results reflect lending activities prior to the establishment of our interim targets, set in November 2021.

The three years of FELI data reported cover a timeframe during which our business activities were not managed to our commitment to net zero financed emissions.

Increased emissions reporting by companies is extremely helpful in improving the accuracy of our financed emissions metrics.

However, this makes year over year trend analysis particularly challenging.

As companies expand their reporting coverage to additional categories of emissions, particularly scope 3 emissions categories, they report higher emissions year over year, which results in our financed emissions metrics trending upwards.

It also means that our 2019 baseline is likely to be under representing the emissions during that year.

Current modeling approaches are not adjusted to account for these revised reporting approaches, where possible.

The result of this dynamic is that emissions data may not be representative of, or well correlated to, underlying company performance.

In particular, we have seen that production of oil and gas among portfolio companies covered by our Energy emissions target has remained relatively flat, while we’ve seen an uptick in scope 3 emissions from 2019 to 2021.

For example, a company may only report one category of scope 3 emissions in 2019, but in 2021 report 2 categories.

This would show an increase in emissions for a company that may not have actually happened.

Carbon data for our clients’ scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions is evolving and improving.

During this period of data quality improvement, we have seen that the data has significant variability year over year.

Carbon data quality is highly impacted by the extent to which companies are reporting emissions data.

In the past three years, we have seen a notable increase in emissions data reported by companies, which is helpful in improving the accuracy of our metrics.

However, it also means that our metrics, which rely on that data, have some volatility as well.

As discussed in our previous years’ climate reporting, carbon data also has a significant time lag, which means that we do not obtain new client carbon data sets until 12 18 months after the underlying emissions generating activities have taken place.

However, it means that we currently must make real time business decisions with data that is both evolving in quality and delayed.

With that as the backdrop, several different factors influence the movement of our FELI metric.

We explain these dynamics in more detail in the attribution analysis section below.

Portfolio mix of our corporate relationship and event loans.

Fluctuations in enterprise value including cash (EVIC).

Methodologies used to calculate a portfolio company’s estimated emissions where they are not reported by the company.

Change in scope of emissions reported by portfolio companies.

These challenges are industry wide and not specific to our method of tracking emissions or our clients’ production activities.

As data improves, we expect reported emissions to be more representative of actual emissions from their underlying activities, and thus more accurately reflect how our clients are working to address their own emissions footprint.

For this reason, we encourage companies across all sectors, especially high emitting sectors, to report emissions data accurately and comprehensively and to also restate prior years, where appropriate.

We remain committed to our net zero and interim emissions targets.

As detailed in the section Our Approach to the Net Zero Transition , we have a clear strategy to engage with our clients to meet our commitments and reduce FELI over time, including by leveraging a range of data to help drive decisions.

Our CSAF framework will provide forward looking data on our clients which complements GHG emissions data, which are historical.

As stated in our public methodology document, we view this journey as iterative, and we will continue to evolve our approach as the data and disclosure evolves.

To that end, we will evaluate our sources of data, our target methodology and our disclosure options over time to help ensure the metrics that we publicly report are aligned with our business and our clients’ activities.

This year, a key provider of GHG emissions data for our FELI analysis changed its methodology to restate certain prior year scope 3 data.

The goal of this change was to enhance the quality, accuracy, and comparability of a company’s emissions performance over time.

Previously, a restated prior year emissions number was only done in the case of an error.

Now, the restated data reflects when companies restate prior year figures.

This increased the number of restated figures in the 2019 data and resulted in changes to the sources of underlying sector specific datasets used by the data provider.

However, restatements are limited to companies retroactively restating scope level numbers wholly.

Restatements will not occur if a company expanded scope 3 sub category reporting in a current year, but not a prior year.

The result may be an increase in emissions due to reporting at the sub category levels, which may make emissions challenging to compare on a year over year basis.

We have incorporated the data provider’s updated scope 3 company emissions values into our previously published 2019 FELI and Absolute Financed Emissions (AFE) results for our three interim target sectors, as shown in the table below.

This restatement supports enhanced consistency across reporting years.

Our 2030 targets remain unchanged, and our baseline is now the restated 2019 FELI results.

As data and methodologies continue to improve, we may make additional restatements to our financed emissions reporting as appropriate.

We also encourage all emissions data providers to provide public information on their restatement methodologies, and to explore the inclusion of restated data across all emission scopes.

The following FELI metric figures represent the amount of GHG emitted22 by portfolio clients for each 1 million in corporate lending committed by the Firm as of year end.

Auto Manufacturing: After a decline in 2020, our Auto FELI increased by 42% in 2021.

This was primarily due to a corporate merger between two borrowers which resulted in updated absolute emissions reporting for the newly merged company.

This made the data less comparable to prior year emissions for each company pre merger.

Absent this transaction, our FELI would have continued a downward trend in 2021.

The majority of our current Auto Manufacturing clients have demonstrated plans to grow electric vehicle production and are benefiting from changes in government policy designed to further decarbonize the transportation sector.

With that as the backdrop, we expect to see continued FELI declines in our Auto Manufacturing sector target over time.

Energy: FELI increased by 22% in 2020 and 10% in 2021.

In 2020, a reduction in the carbon emissions of our loan portfolio was offset by lower EVIC valuations and a change in the portfolio mix.

There was a positive portfolio mix shift and increase in EVIC, however the reporting of carbon emissions increased significantly.

The emissions increase can be primarily attributed to improvements in portfolio companies’ disclosure quality and methodology, including a number of companies that reported for the first time in 2021.

It also stems from companies’ expanded reporting of additional scope 3 sub categories and additional types of products accounted for in Use of Sold Product lifecycle emissions measurements.

We do however recognize that a small amount of the increase was due to upticks in underlying oil and gas production from certain clients, which is in line with global energy production trends during this period.

Power: FELI for our Power sector target decreased significantly by 15% in 2021 compared to our 2019 baseline.

This was driven by a decline in global electricity generation volumes from FY19 to FY20 as Covid 19 restrictions were enacted and our clients’ focus on evolving their power generation mix to lower emissions sources.

It also reflects our increased financing to companies with lower emissions intensity.

Overall, electric power providers continue to seek to expand electricity generation from renewables.

We also see our clients in this sector moving to incorporate battery storage technology, and the adoption of new policies that we expect will accelerate the adoption of zero carbon power.

We saw a slight uptick in FELI from 2020 to 2021 due to increased company emissions with the recovery in global generation as Covid 19 restrictions were lifted.

Given the data limitations and challenges outlined above regarding higher quality data leading to increasing figures over time, we also performed a sensitivity analysis to understand the impact on FELI if we held borrower carbon values constant across all years using 2021 company emissions (and emission factors) which represent the most current and accurate results.

Under these assumptions, we estimate that our 2019 baseline FELI for Energy would have been 21% higher than our current restated value and 11% higher for Auto Manufacturing.

We recognize that absolute emissions provide helpful additional context, which is why we also report absolute emissions information, in line with our commitment to PCAF.

However, our AFE results also demonstrate the variability of using drawn exposure amounts, compared to committed exposure, to measure our financed emissions impact.

For the Auto Manufacturing sector portfolio, our AFE results demonstrate a substantial decline across the three years.

This is primarily due to a decrease in the total amount that companies in this portfolio drew against their loans, and a shift towards clients with lower carbon intensity footprints.

Within the Energy sector portfolio, the total amount that companies drew against their loans decreased across all three years.

However, upstream exploration and production companies represented a higher share of drawn amounts in 2020, hence an increase in AFE given their higher carbon intensity versus other transportation and services companies in the sector.

This client mix shifted back in 2021, leading to the year over year decline between 2020 and 2021.

For the Power sector portfolio, the large increase in 2021 is driven by a single client with a higher carbon intensity profile, which did not draw down on its loan in prior years.

Were calculated using third party data inputs, which include estimates, and Morgan Stanley does not provide assurance on the veracity of such information.

While Morgan Stanley believes the data has been reasonably determined based on current practices, methodologies and standards in this area continue to evolve and may change.

Also, as noted above, third party data providers may restate such information from prior years which may cause us to restate prior period emissions.

See also Climate Data Limitations and Challenges and Use of Third Party Estimates.

Are not comparable to financed emissions data of other financial institutions, which may have different business models and lending practices, and may use different accounting methodologies and data to determine financed emissions.

May vary from year to year based on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.

While Morgan Stanley introduced its interim targets at the end of 2021 and did not manage FELI exposure from 2019 2021, readers are cautioned not to base conclusions on future progress toward interim targets on year over year results, but should consider trends over a longer period of time.

Were also not prepared in accordance with, and not meant to comply with, any current proposed or future regulatory disclosure requirements.

Morgan Stanley calculates data quality scores for our financed emissions reporting in accordance with the PCAF guidelines.

These scores indicate the data quality associated with the emissions data underlying our calculations based on the source of the data, on a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being the highest quality.

For example, company reported emissions are scored as higher data quality as they are specific and may be third party verified, whereas economic activity based emissions factors which are used to estimate company emissions are considered lower data quality.

PCAF guidance recommends calculating a data quality score for scopes 1 and 2 separate from a score for scope 3.

For more information on the PCAF Data Quality scale, see the PCAF methodology document.

The Absolute Financed Emissions metric includes only a subset of companies within our portfolio which have drawn exposure at year end, whereas the FELI metric includes all companies with our portfolio.

As such, we consider that reporting data quality scores for both metrics is important to understand and represent our progress.

Across our portfolio, we observed incremental improvements in scope 1 and 2 data quality from 2019 to 2021.

For FELI, our scope 1 and 2 portfolio data quality score improved from 2.5 to 2.3, and for FELI, our score improved from 3.4 to 3.2.

However, we continue to see an overall lower level of reported scope 3 emissions data from companies.

For AFE, our scope 3 portfolio data quality score marginally declined from 3.5 in 2019 to 3.6 in 2021.

However when our full set of clients is considered through the FELI metric, our score marginally improved from 2.9 to 2.8.

As noted earlier in this report, emissions data continues to have significant limitations and challenges.

Below we describe these challenges in order to educate our stakeholders about the complexity in calculating FELI and financed emissions.

Data Lag: As discussed in our 2021 Climate Report, emissions data is often unavailable until 12 18 months after the fiscal year end, far exceeding common financial reporting timeframes.

This lag is due to a range of factors including company GHG data reporting cycles the time it takes for vendors to source, aggregate and analyze data and vendor data quality checks.

This requires making internal decisions utilizing data that is often not up to date and therefore not reflective of current practices from clients.

The other implication of this lag is that when the emissions are disclosed 1.5 2 years later utilizing matching portfolio data and GHG emissions data as PCAF suggests, the public figures are not the same as the data that was being managed to at that point in time.

Said another way, financial institutions will not know the actual results of business decisions and performance until a year and half later.

Limited Company Reporting: Another limitation financial institutions must manage is the lack of company reporting across GHG scopes, especially for scope 3 emissions.

Scope 3 data is generally estimated by third party providers because it is often underreported.

Therefore, scope 3 emissions data is heavily dependent on estimation methodologies which can differ across data providers, making year over year result comparisons more challenging.

As indicated in the charts below, this is particularly significant in the Energy sector, where scope 3 is the most material contributor of the sector’s emissions.

For reporting 2021, we found only 35% of energy companies within our portfolio report scope 3 emissions compared to over 60% for Auto Manufacturing and Power.

Furthermore, the GHG Protocol methodology directs companies to decide which underlying scope 3 emissions sub categories are most relevant to their respective operations.

Companies within the same sub sector may determine different underlying categories as relevant in their emissions disclosures.

In some cases, companies may determine categories relevant, but may opt to not report.

These GHG reporting nuances introduce significant variability across reporting boundaries for scope 3 emissions from both figures derived from data providers and those reported by companies, making comparisons difficult.

Data Provider Specific Methodology Decisions: Our financed emissions calculations depend on GHG data from two primary sources company reported emissions data and third party data provider estimations (see our 2030 Interim Targets Methodology for details).

For reported emissions data companies report different GHG emission figures across different disclosure channels.

For example, the same company might report different emissions figures in its CDP report, its annual report, and or its sustainability report.

Third party data providers do not uniformly select one disclosure type over another source, resulting in differences across these data providers.

In addition, data providers can retroactively implement changes in their own estimation methodology year on year, which could lead to restatement of prior years’ data.

On the other hand, some data providers may choose not to revise or update their prior years’ emissions data sets when companies restate their own data.

These third party data providers may also choose to estimate emissions data even where reported data is available if the company underwent a significant corporate action such as an initial public offering or a corporate merger.

In other cases, data providers may implement methodological changes to improve accuracy, but may limit such changes to certain years or certain reporting boundaries.

Any of these instances potentially create anomalous results when comparing these estimates to prior year reported emissions, complicating trend analysis.

Year over year variances in reported emissions are not necessarily correlated with an Energy company’s production and related end use emissions.

The data in this example has been anonymized but is representative of a change in emissions values disclosed by a company and the values reported by data providers.

For the first time, an oil and gas producer disclosed its emissions for the most recent year (2021) and the previous year (2020).

A data provider which used a production based estimate for the company’s 2020 emissions pivots to utilize the company’s reported value for 2021 emissions.

However, the data provider does not retroactively revise or restate its prior year estimate for the company’s 2020 emissions.

In this example, there is a resulting discrepancy between the company’s reported change in emissions ( 20% YoY) and the implied change ( 300% YoY), while erroneously demonstrating an inverse relationship to annual production which decreased ( 5%) over the same period.

Our goal in sharing this case study is to illustrate the complexities in the data dynamics which drive the results of our FELI emissions.

Over time, we expect increased company reporting and consistency in the relationship between emissions data as reported and underlying production and use of sold products.

From 2012 through 2022, Morgan Stanley reduced its total location based emissions by 41% and its market based emissions by 74%.

Key strategies to reduce emissions include increasing the efficiency of our infrastructure and using renewable electricity on site.

We are also working to enhance the efficiency of our heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems (HVAC) reducing the water intensity of our HVAC focusing on plug load management to reduce parasitic losses and leveraging daylighting to improve the employee workplace while reducing lighting loads.

In 2020 and 2021, the COVID 19 pandemic contributed to reduced emissions due to remote working and reduced travel.

In 2022, we began to see the impact of returning to work and increased business travel across our emissions aligning to declining health and safety restrictions.

In particular, scope 1 increased due to higher utilization of office real estate and vehicles and aircraft operated by the Firm or employees, scope 2 increased due to higher utilization of office and data center real estate reflecting increased use and technology business demand, and scope 3 increased due to increased business travel.

Delivering Actionable Analysis The ISI informs and empowers the growing number of investors looking to drive environmental and social impact.

Our thought leadership focuses on trends driving sustainable investing and critical thematic issues such as climate change and inclusive economic growth.

With the global economy on the rebound, corporations have a critical role to play in delivering an inclusive recovery that addresses the glaring social and economic disparities exposed by the pandemic and the renewed focus on issues of social justice in the U.S.

Grasping this opportunity brings benefits to society and can also improve risk and return profiles for bonds, as demonstrated by new research from the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing.

Corporations have far reaching impacts on society, their stakeholders and economic growth through the decisions they make across four key areas of business: their employees, products and services, operations and management practices.

Their choices can either support or hinder inclusive growth that delivers broad based economic gains and opportunity.

This brief introduces the Institute’s proprietary Inclusive Growth Score, which measures company performance across these four key areas.

When we applied the metric to the U.S. corporate bond market, we found that investors, on average, viewed bonds issued by high scoring companies as less risky than bonds issued by low scoring companies during 2020’s severe market volatility.

These findings reinforce previous Institute analyses showing that investment funds incorporating social and environmental criteria can outperform their traditional counterparts.

Our Inclusive Growth Score offers a valuable new quantitative metric to support investors, corporate decision makers and other stakeholders as they pursue a sustainable and resilient post pandemic global economy.

There is a major opportunity for asset managers to better align their sustainable investment practices, products and reporting with the expectations and priorities of asset owners globally, according to the latest Sustainable Signals survey from the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing.

For the first time, the survey combines insights from both asset owners and asset managers to give a more complete industry snapshot.

Our findings suggest that if asset managers were to take advantage of the opportunity, and if gaps in ESG data and unmet demand for specialized talent were addressed, then this could help boost sustainable investing market growth opportunities.

Sustainable Reality: Strong Inclusive Growth Performance Drives Down Risk for Bondholders demonstrated that bonds issued by companies ranking high on inclusive growth metrics had lower credit spreads and were considered less risky than bonds issued by low scoring peers.

This in turn can impact corporate bond performance, especially in times of severe market volatility.

Sustainable Signals: How Asset Managers Can Meet Growing Asset Owner Demand surveyed global asset managers and asset owners to understand global market trends in sustainable investing for institutional investors.

The findings revealed that asset managers have a significant opportunity to better align their sustainable investment ESG practices, products and reporting with the expectations and priorities of asset owners globally.

In 2022, the Fusion Response team monitored 84 weather and other natural hazards and reacted to 31 of these events, including hurricanes, wildfires, blizzards and earthquakes.

We most recently implemented recovery strategies in 2022 when Category 4 Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida, bringing winds of up to 155 mph and 12 18 inches of rain.

Our top concern was for our approximately 3,500 staff in the area, with other impacts including damage to property and infrastructure and widespread power and internet outages.

Our Crisis Management team kept in touch with stakeholders throughout the storm and its aftermath through triage and impact communications, using the Firm’s Rapid Notification System to assess and confirm employee safety and to intervene and provide support through housing assistance, supplies and other resources, as required.

Morgan Stanley’s three business segments aim to advance our D I, climate and sustainability priorities by driving innovation across global capital markets.

We strive to be our clients' financial services partner of choice for innovative financial solutions and advisory services designed to deliver both competitive financial returns as well as environmental or social benefit.

Across our businesses, we are committed to mobilizing 1 trillion in sustainable finance by 2030.

Tracking toward our 2030 1Tn Sustainable Finance Target and 750Bn Low Carbon and Green Subset is guided by our Sustainable Finance Framework (the Framework).

The Framework is maintained by the Global Sustainability Office, which considers the UN SDGs and industry frameworks and standards such as the International Capital Markets Association’s’ Green and Social Bond Principles when evaluating the Framework on an annual basis to help ensure alignment with evolving industry best practices.

The Framework is further informed by input from contributing business units and relevant committees across the Firm in order to remain aligned with our Firm ESG priorities and changes in our business activities and products.

In addition, the underlying data is reviewed annually by an internal control function.

Business segments, units and programs contributing to the target include Investment Banking, Global Capital Markets, Public Finance, Securitized Products Group, Commodities, Investment Management, Wealth Management, Community Development Finance, the Inclusive Ventures Lab and the Morgan Stanley Sustainable Solutions Collaborative.

Eligible themes and products under the Framework are shown below.

Unless otherwise noted, eligible transactions and investments may be either ESG labeled (i.e., having designated use of proceeds or key performance indicators aligned with eligible themes), entity based (i.e., transactions without a designated use of proceeds, but that support a client entity that has a significant majority of revenue or underlying activities from eligible themes) or specifically eligible under the U.S. Community Reinvestment Act.

Eligible investments may also include strategies incorporating certain sustainable or impact investing criteria.

In calculating cumulative progress towards our goal, we reflect the full transaction value for eligible financing, facilitation and advisory activities, as opposed to the proportional value attributable to Morgan Stanley in most instances, in order to remain consistent with the approach taken since we set our initial low carbon financing target in 2018.

However, we reflect commitment amounts for term loan and revolver lending facilities and do not include transactions where Morgan Stanley served as a co manager for our Global Capital Markets and Public Finance businesses.

For all eligible investment strategies managed or distributed, we reflect assets under management by Morgan Stanley as of December 31, 2022, which include changes due to asset flows and market performance during the calendar year.

In 2022, we enhanced our Framework and tracking to include several business segments and products for the first time including financing of eligible term loans and revolving credit facilities, facilitation of ESG labeled securitized products, transactions to enable retiring of verified, voluntary carbon offsets credits across physical products, and investments made by the Morgan Stanley Inclusive Ventures Lab.

As part of enhancing our Framework in 2022, we also refined the eligibility criteria for investment strategies managed by Morgan Stanley Investment Management and distributed by Morgan Stanley Wealth Management to better reflect current Firm classifications of sustainable and low carbon and green investment strategies.

This includes ESG knowledge sharing across investment teams and client market trends.

As active investors and active owners, we have a duty to be good stewards of our clients’ capital.

We fulfill this duty by engaging with selected companies in which we invest, and by exercising our proxy voting and other rights as shareholders.

These stewardship activities give us the opportunity to help guide companies in which we invest toward better ESG practices.

Our investment teams endeavor to engage in constructive dialogue with companies, which may encompass meetings and discussions on a particular issue or multiyear engagements stewardship on a range of E, S or G topics specific to the company or asset to seek to encourage enhancement.

On the public markets side, we exercise our proxy voting and other rights as shareholders.

MSIM’s Thematic Engagement Priorities focus on four themes, aligned with the UN SDGs, which are issues that may cause risk to our society and wellbeing, economy and or capital markets.

The priorities touch our investment teams to varying degrees depending on asset class, geography, investment style and strategy.

The investment teams responsible for MSIM’s actively managed investment solutions generally find one to one discussions to be the most effective way to articulate views to a company’s management.

However, we are supportive of collaborative engagement where it could be necessary or useful to materially enhance portfolio values and where we can do so in a manner that is in full compliance with applicable laws, regulations and judicial precedents.

Other factors that we consider before participating in collaborative actions include, but are not limited to: potential conflicts of interest, our obligations under competition or antitrust laws, materiality of the issue, and potential for delivering tangible outcomes in relation to key sustainability or stewardship related issues.

These may include collaboration with industry peers and standard setting organizations, and engagement in public policy development in ways that seek to advance sustainable investing practices.

Notwithstanding the adopted mode of collaboration, we approach collaborative engagement from the perspective of our role as fiduciaries of client assets, acting on behalf of and in the best interests of our clients.

In 2022, MSIM targeted new D I partnerships that align with our fiduciary duties and client interests, and focused on obtaining positive outcomes.

MSIM joined the 30% Club’s U.K. Investor Group, an investor initiative that brings together more than 40 investors with 11 trillion in AUM to drive change with companies on inclusion and diversity.

MSIM’s International Equity team co chairs this initiative alongside National Employment Savings Trust, the U.K.’s largest pension fund.

This past year, MSIM also joined FAIRR, WBA and the PRI Advance, a stewardship initiative led by the PRI, where institutional investors work together to take action on human rights and social issues.

The MSIM Emerging Markets Equity team believes that a responsible energy transition includes companies that enable the energy transition and or companies in high emitting sectors with viable and or Paris aligned decarbonization pathways.

With more than 60% of global carbon emissions coming from emerging markets,33 the team believes it is important to help companies progress on transition pathways, rather than exclude those companies from the investment universe.

Over the course of 2022, the team engaged with a number of companies focused on responsible energy, as well as those with high carbon emissions, to analyze the viability of and promote progress on transition pathways.

MSIM encourages companies to have both long and short term feasible targets that are integrated in business operations, with accountable oversight at the board level, and carbon analysis on which to support and measure progress.

Of the companies the Emerging Markets Equity team engaged with, they found that several metals and mining companies were leading on each of these metrics.

There were other companies that were improving on decarbonization with feasible targets and plans to integrate those further into the business with oversight and carbon analysis.

Some were assessed as laggards in their respective industries, given the lack of interim targets or integration planning.

The team has shared best practices with those companies and will continue stewardship efforts to effectuate progress toward integration of transition plans.

MSIM engages with companies across their capital structure, including through our debt holdings.

We leverage our Fixed Income platform to engage with bond issuers beyond listed companies, including sovereign states, agencies and private companies.

A large number of these engagements primarily focus on environmental risks and opportunities, in particular decarbonizing fossil fuel intensive sectors, climate related disclosure, and biodiversity and deforestation issues in sectors like agribusiness.

We also focus on how sustainable debt financing can support these efforts.

Exercising our proxy voting rights enables us to guide portfolio companies toward improved ESG practices, which we believe will produce attractive returns for our clients over the long term.

Proxy voting decisions are typically made in house by members of the relevant investment team and the Global Stewardship team, as required.

For more information on our approach to engagement and proxy voting policies in 2022, see MSIM Proxy Voting Policy and MSIM Engagement Stewardship Principles.

Diversity in clinical trials is a significant challenge for pharmaceutical companies.

Clinical trial efficacy is, to a large extent, determined by the diversity of the trial population.

Failure to effectively incorporate a suitable degree of diversity in population samples limits understanding of the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and therapies.

The risks that may arise from this are potentially severe, from product failures and poor health outcomes to litigation risk for companies.

Moreover, a clinical trial is often the only way for a patient to gain access to the most advanced treatment, and so underrepresentation of certain populations may mean patients are excluded from potentially beneficial therapies for a long period of time.

Now, regulators are taking action to address the issue.

To tackle the challenge, the FDA published its final guidance in 2020 on enhancing the diversity of clinical trial populations.

In 2022, the International Equity team engaged with several pharmaceutical companies in its portfolio to understand how companies manage and address diversity in clinical trials, and ask them to embed it in their processes starting with better disclosures to investors.

Some companies have implemented changes, which they are preparing to disclose to investors.

For example, one large Swiss company has created a Clinical Trial Diversity Program and recruited an experienced leader who is driving change across the business and created a dashboard where they track the makeup of trial populations, and diversity is now embedded into the annual bonuses of trial project managers.

The International Equity team will monitor further company disclosures and continue to engage on this subject.

The U.K. government has committed to reduce carbon emissions at a national level by 2050 and the electrification of transportation will be important in meeting those targets.

The U.K. and European Union are highly supportive of electric vehicle (EV) adoption and many traditional auto companies have made major commitments to developing their EV manufacturing capability.

However, a lack of EV charging infrastructure has been a significant hindrance to EV adoption, with 17Bn of EV charging infrastructure estimated to be needed in Europe by 203036 to meet expected demand.

To help accelerate the adoption of EVs, the Private Markets Solutions team invested in the largest owner operated network of rapid EV chargers in the U.K. (at the time of investment, June 2020).

The company owns, operates and maintains rapid EV charging units capable of fully recharging most EVs quickly.

The company also secures long term leases at locations where dwell times align with charging times, such as gas stations, highway service stations and retail sites.

The company maintains excellent availability across its portfolio, partnering with leading technology providers to install high quality chargers at key locations nationwide.

MSIM’s investment teams incorporate the assessment of material ESG risks and opportunities into investment decision making processes, as appropriate, and according to investment teams’ particular investment strategies.

Incorporation of such ESG risks and opportunities may occur at various stages of the investment life cycle including due diligence and research, valuation, asset selection, portfolio construction, and ongoing engagement and investment monitoring.

Portfolio managers and investment teams may take into account climate related risks and opportunities that could have a significant effect on value, investments and or portfolios, where applicable.

Approaches include, but are not limited to, evaluating, as applicable, the carbon footprint and intensity of investments as well as portfolio companies’ climate resiliency and adaptation strategies.

MSIM supports efforts to advance sustainable use of natural resources and a circular economy.

In particular, several of our investment strategies incorporate analysis of related risks and opportunities.

Ocean Health strategy assesses U.S. large cap issuers on their efforts to address ocean health.

Companies in the packaged foods, food retail and restaurant sectors are therefore evaluated on how they reduce plastic product waste, use recycled materials and replace single use plastic products with renewable, recyclable or compostable alternatives.

Calvert’s research evaluates sector firms across the value chain from design and materials supply to production, transport, distribution and end of life.

Potential investees are assessed based on natural capital impact in areas including pollution, water use, carbon emissions and waste management.

This research feeds into Calvert investment strategies, as appropriate.

We offer clients a range of sustainable investing solutions from products that integrate37 ESG factors at various stages of the investment life cycle to sustainable focused products that seek to achieve certain sustainability standards in the investment process (such as by meeting a minimum standard for inclusion, having an intentional tilt toward certain sustainability factors, and or requiring a minimum allocation to certain thematic labelled certified securities) to funds that seek to achieve attractive financial returns alongside positive environmental and or social impacts.

MSIM launched several D I focused investment strategies that are a key focus area for many of our clients and investors.

These strategies include the impact focused Morgan Stanley Next Level Fund, which invests in startups led by women and diverse entrepreneurs, Calvert Diversity Research strategies and a Morgan Stanley Institutional Liquidity Fund Government Securities Portfolio centered on purchase transactions with diverse broker dealers.

In November 2022, MSIM launched 1GT, a growth oriented private equity platform to invest in companies seeking to mitigate climate change.

Through the collective investments it makes, the platform seeks to avoid or remove one gigaton of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from the Earth’s atmosphere from the date of investment through 2050.

The new platform focuses its investments on private companies that seek to deliver attractive financial returns alongside measurable positive environmental impacts across the mobility, power, sustainable food and agriculture, and circular economy sectors.

The platform will seek to leverage Morgan Stanley’s sustainability resources to partner with portfolio companies.

This may include monitoring ESG risks, reporting scopes 1 3 emissions, aligning companies with key trends and pursuing earnings growth, multiple expansion and enhanced exit potential.

Morgan Stanley helps deliver positive changes in communities across the United States.

Our program’s track record in meeting community needs has consistently earned Morgan Stanley’s U.S. Banks Outstanding ratings from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, most recently awarded in 2022.

Our Community Development Finance (CDF) Group is a key driver of inclusive growth at Morgan Stanley.

Preservation and development of sustainable, multifamily, affordable rental housing.

Morgan Stanley’s 1 billion Social Bond, issued in 2020, accelerates this work by directing capital into affordable housing projects that support vulnerable communities.

For more details and case studies, see our Social Bond disclosures.

New construction, preservation and rehabilitation of affordable housing are core components of our community development strategy and a critical need across the country.

CDF has continued to help alleviate the growing housing affordability crisis, financing over 75 affordable housing developments for a total of 1.5 billion in 2022.

CDF provided a 50 million loan to support the renovation of the Williamsburg Houses located in Brooklyn, New York, consisting of 20 four story residential buildings with 1,621 affordable apartments and 18 retail locations.

As part of this transaction, residents benefited from rental subsidies through 20 year contracts from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Morgan Stanley has helped meet needs after natural disasters in many ways, including CDF’s work to support community development activities in the wake of extreme weather events.

Natural disasters, such as the California wildfires, can exacerbate affordable housing shortages.

We work with locally based partners to provide financing that helps communities rebuild.

In 2022, Morgan Stanley financed 43 million for the adaptive reuse and new construction of 90 affordable apartments in Napa, California.

A majority of the apartments will house farmworker households and the formerly homeless, with social service coordination provided for all residents, including adult education programming.

Since the Great Recession, rural communities have faced an escalating housing crisis.

Although rural markets have lower housing costs compared to metro markets, these areas still face persistent poverty.

We seek opportunities to finance affordable housing and support the needs of residents in rural communities.

In 2022, Morgan Stanley provided more than 17 million to build a new 54 unit affordable housing development in Lindsay, California, a small rural community.

Amenities include an outdoor playground and picnic area, and a community building with a kitchen, bathrooms, computer lab and management offices.

The design maximizes on site recreational and open space, and the site offers additional supportive services including adult education, after school programs and part time service coordination.

As part of our inclusive growth strategy, CDF is addressing the need to provide additional human capital support for high impact community organizations and develop the next generation of leaders in the community development field.

Launched in New York City in 2012, our Community Development Fellows program has since expanded to Salt Lake City, Utah, and the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.

The program places graduate students in school year long, paid fellowships at local community organizations.

The nonprofits receive high quality assistance, and the students receive valuable experience.

A high percentage of the participants remain in the community and economic development field.

The Morgan Stanley Inclusive Ventures Group (MSIVG) works to address the significant market inefficiency limiting access to capital for women and ethnically diverse startup founders.

Previously named the Multicultural Client Strategy Group, MSIVG’s innovative approach to bridging investment gaps focuses on changing investor attitudes and behaviors, accelerating growth and investing directly in early stage, technology enabled companies founded by underserved entrepreneurs.

Launched in 2016, MSIVG’s mission is to deliver strong returns and long term value by creating a more equitable investment landscape.

The Morgan Stanley Inclusive Ventures Lab (the Lab) is an intensive, five month, in house accelerator designed to help further develop and scale startups, culminating in a showcase presentation and Demo Day to the investor community.

Morgan Stanley launched the Lab, formerly called the Multicultural Innovation Lab, in 2017, to address inequities in funding of ethnically and racially diverse and women led startups.

In 2022, we hosted our first global cohort, including companies from the United States and EMEA.

Through the Lab, Morgan Stanley makes direct investments in early stage, high growth companies, and supports each founder's growth and development through a rigorous program and a global ecosystem of internal and external partners.

The Lab provides startups in the program with much needed access to investors along with the tools, resources and connections to grow and thrive.

To date, 69 companies have gone through the program, reaching more than 730 million in combined valuation and raising 195 million in funding after participating in the Lab.

Previous participants have used the platform to secure additional funding rounds, refine their strategy and expand their business and some have been acquired.

Following the Lab’s global expansion in 2022, the 2023 cohort will support up to 15 companies in the U.S. and 10 companies in EMEA.

The Next Level Fund, established as a partnership between MSIVG and MSIM, makes privately negotiated equity and equity related venture capital investments in primarily early stage technology and technology enabled companies with women or underrepresented founders as part of the founding team.

The Next Level Fund is also backed by three key corporate partners: Hearst, Microsoft and Walmart.

The targeted partnership strategy aims to improve outcomes for portfolio companies by providing funds and specific strategic expertise to accelerate business results.

In 2022, the Fund deployed a quarter of the capital across 10 companies.

Many of these companies were not only founded by underrepresented groups, but serve them as well.

Implement a change management program and foster open communication to embed the net zero transition plan into the organizations, culture and practices.

For the purpose of accounting and reporting GHG emissions, Morgan Stanley adopts the Operational Control approach as defined by the GHG Protocol for consolidating GHG emissions.

Under this approach, Morgan Stanley accounts for 100% of the GHG emissions from operations over which it has operational control.

This includes all owned or leased facilities that the company occupies, and all vehicles that the company owns or leases and operates.

Morgan Stanley equity method investments, along with investment funds and other managed entities and their respective portfolio companies and assets are excluded under this boundary.

Morgan Stanley’s base year for its GHG inventory is 2012, the earliest year for which we had reliable data.

The location based results have been used as a proxy to calculate scope 2 market based emissions for the 2012 base year as the Firm cannot calculate market based results for that year.

Morgan Stanley will follow the guidelines in the Climate Leaders Greenhouse Gas Inventory Protocol Design Principles (U.S. EPA, 2005) for adjusting the base year GHG inventory.

The base year inventory will be adjusted in response to any structural or methodology changes, if the resulting adjustment is more than 5% of total base year emissions disclosed.

Adjustments less than this threshold are considered insignificant and will be decided case by case.

On an annual basis, Morgan Stanley calculates the Firm’s GHG emissions inventory: CO2 (Carbon Dioxide), CH4 (Methane), N2O (Nitrous Oxide), HFCs (Hydrofluorocarbons).

The Firm currently has no emissions from PFCs, SF6, or NF3.

Emissions of non CO2 greenhouse gases are converted to CO2 equivalent emissions by multiplying by the global warming potential (GWPs) from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), and EPA Emissions Hub 2022 (2022).

GHG emissions are calculated using third party software, with factors applied based on location and emission source (see table below).

There are exceptions for some GHG emission calculations, which are performed external to the third party software, including scope 1 mobile combustion and scope 3 category 6 (business travel) emission sources and their related GHG emissions.

Emission source activity and the related GHG emissions calculations that take place external to the third party software have their results loaded into the software to maintain a single record of GHG emissions for all scopes.

In most instances, the most up to date emission quantification factors are sourced from international and national environmental authorities across the globe (including but not limited to the International Energy Agency (IEA), United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), United Kingdom Department for Environmental, Food Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and others) and applied to respective regions.

To calculate the scope 1 and 2 emissions, Morgan Stanley gathers actual emission source activity data for all owned facilities and all triple net lease facilities that Morgan Stanley operates and can obtain utility invoice data.

For all other facilities where activity data is not available, Morgan Stanley estimates emissions by adopting the method of energy use intensity factors for annual emission source activity per square foot based on similar facilities, according to building type and region.

Estimation intensity factors are held constant unless specified in a methodology change.

Morgan Stanley may make individual exceptions if data is available for full service gross leased facilities that would be estimated, and instead use actual data.

Scope 2 market based emissions are calculated including the impact from Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) from our Virtual Power Purchasing Agreement and Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) from renewable power systems.

In the case of emissions from fuel cells, we obtain the produced emissions directly from a third party provider.

For scope 3 category 6 (business travel) and scope 1 mobile combustion, travel data is collected from suppliers and publicly available emission factors are used to estimate emissions.

For scope 3 category 13 (downstream leased assets), activity data is collected from electricity invoices paid.

Emissions from electricity are calculated using region specific emission factors.

Emissions sources outside of purchased electricity from tenants that lease property from the Firm at its office facilities are de minimis and thus excluded from this inventory.

As data is collected, there will be instances where data may be missing due to delays in data availability.

The third party software calculates accruals for emission source activities for time periods of missing electricity and stationary fuels consumption data at the account level based on the respective data history.

The information within this appendix was subject to Deloitte Touche LLP’s review.

See Independent Accountant’s Review Report, page 111.

We engaged Deloitte Touche LLP ( Deloitte ) to perform a review engagement on management’s assertion that the Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3, Category 6 (Business travel) and Scope 3, Category 13 (Downstream leased assets) Greenhouse Gas Emissions metrics presented within the Morgan Stanley 2022 ESG Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (the subject matter ) are presented in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) published by the World Resources Institute World Business Council for Sustainable Development (the criteria ).

Information outside of the subject matter, including linked information, was not subject to Deloitte Touche LLP’s review and, accordingly, Deloitte Touche LLP does not express a conclusion or any form of assurance on such information.

Further, any information relating to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2022, or information relating to forward looking statements, targets, goals and progress against goals, was not subject to Deloitte Touche LLP’s review and, accordingly, Deloitte Touche LLP does not express a conclusion or any form of assurance on such information.

Management of Morgan Stanley is responsible for the completeness, accuracy and validity of the subject matter for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

Management is also responsible for the collection, quantification and presentation of the information included in the 2022 ESG Report and for the selection of the criteria, which management believes provide an objective basis for measuring and reporting on the subject matter.

Management of Morgan Stanley asserts that the subject matter for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, are presented in accordance with the criteria.

IINNDDEEPPEENNDDEENNTT AACCCCOOUUNNTTAANNTT’’SS RREEPPOORRTT To Those Charged with Governance: We have reviewed the assertion of Morgan Stanley management that its Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3, Category 6 (Business travel) and Scope 3, Category 13 (Downstream leased assets) Greenhouse Gas Emissions metrics presented within the Morgan Stanley 2022 ESG Report as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (referred to as the subject matter ) are presented in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) published by the World Resources Institute World Business Council for Sustainable Development (the criteria ).

Morgan Stanley management is responsible for its assertion.

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the subject matter based on our review.

Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the subject matter in order for it to be presented in accordance with the criteria.

The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing from and are substantially less in extent than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the subject matter is presented in accordance with the criteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion.

Because of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an examination been performed.

We believe that the review evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion.

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical requirements in accordance with the Code of Professional Conduct issued by the AICPA.

We applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA and, accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control.

The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment.

In performing our review, we performed analytical procedures, inquiries, and other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

For a selection of the subject matter, we performed tests of mathematical accuracy of computations, compared the specified information to underlying records, or observed the data collection process.

The preparation of the subject matter included within the Morgan Stanley 2022 ESG Report requires management to interpret the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported information.

Measurement of certain amounts and metrics may include estimates and assumptions that are subject to substantial inherent measurement uncertainty, including for example, the accuracy and precision of conversion factors or estimation methodologies used by management.

Certain statements herein, including expectations related to targets, goals or objectives such as financed emissions targets, representation objectives and the achievement thereof, may be forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.

These statements are not guarantees of future results or occurrences and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond our control.

Certain forward looking statements included in this report are also based on assumptions, standards, metrics, methodologies and frameworks for measurement, reporting and analysis of climate change that continue to evolve, vary across jurisdictions and regulatory bodies and are the subject of proposed regulatory changes in multiple jurisdictions, which may have a material impact on our future measurement and reporting, as well as the results of the efforts set forth in this report.

In particular, while the foregoing discussion describes potential future events that may be significant or material (based on disclosure recommendations and broader definitions of materiality used by certain voluntary external frameworks and reporting guidelines or those in non U.S. jurisdictions), the significance or materiality of those potential events should not be read as equating to materiality as the concept is used in Morgan Stanley’s periodic filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act.

Certain third party information, such as scope 3 emissions and emissions factors, may change over time as methodologies evolve and are refined or current data changes or is restated or new data is added.

These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates and beliefs made by third parties and by Morgan Stanley.

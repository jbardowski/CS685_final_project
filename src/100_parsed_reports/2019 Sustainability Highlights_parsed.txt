Driving Human Progress:  
2019 Sustainability Highlights

essential to human progress –  
and the transition to a

operations & projects

Our values, experience and history 
tell us we must work in a way that 
delivers real, lasting benefits for the 
owners of our company as well as 
the wider communities in which we 
operate. Today, as the world grows 
more complex, our stakeholders’ 
expectations are changing, and 
growing, and spanning all aspects 
of sustainability – climate change to 
communities. 

For nearly 150 years, this company of 
pioneers has successfully navigated 
both challenge and opportunity – and 
succeeded. We are committed to doing 
so again in this new decade.

Safety remains a core value, and I am 
pleased to report that we ended 2019 
with a strong safety performance, and 
no fatalities. 

This year also marked progress in our 
work with communities. Nearly three 
decades ago, we led our industry’s 
support for recognition of Native Title 
– Indigenous Australians’ right to land 
– which led to the current practice of 
agreement-making with Indigenous 

peoples around the world. In 2019, we 
were pleased to sign several important 
agreements with Indigenous groups in 
Australia and Canada, maintaining our 
ability to access valuable resources, 
and preserving their access to the 
benefits our business can provide.

We set new ambitions and targets: 
our new water targets will help us be 
better stewards of a precious resource, 
whether in water-scarce regions or 
where water is plentiful. We also set a 
new ambition on climate – to achieve 
net zero emissions by 2050 – as well 
as new climate targets: to reduce 
our absolute emissions by 15% and 
emissions intensity by 30%, both by 
2030, against a 2018 baseline (equity 
basis). Overall, our growth between 
now and 2030 will be carbon neutral. 
And this will all be underpinned by 
approximately $1 billion of climate-
related spend over the next five years. 

With the aim of enhancing trust, we 
also progressed our commitment 
to transparency this year, not only 
by disclosing our mineral contracts 

and beneficial ownership, but also 
by disclosing additional information 
about the construction, management 
and monitoring of our tailings storage 
facilities. 

And finally, once again this year, our 
focus on partnership continued and 
intensified – because no business can 
have sustainable, meaningful impact on 
its own.  Partnership is a core enabler 
of our sustainability strategy, and I 
was pleased that in 2019 we were able 
to form new innovative connections 
across the value chain, including those 
to address climate change and skills 
needed for the work of the future.

And so, despite the challenges ahead, 
we look to a new decade with optimism, 
knowing that while companies like ours 
have more to do, we can still be part of 
the solution.

Sincerely, 

J-S Jacques
Chief Executive

Our approach  
to sustainability

Our products touch almost every aspect of modern 
life. Our aim is to generate long-term, sustainable 
profits that allow us to invest in our communities as 
well as in actions to enhance our own sustainability. 
And our activities contribute to economic growth and 
social development around the world.  

Sustainability is central to the way we work. In 2019, 
from new targets on water and climate change to 
renewed commitments to transparency, communities 
and human rights, our integrated sustainability 
strategy continued to focus our efforts on areas in 
which we can make the most difference, underpinned 
by our consideration of the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals.

Water

stewarding a precious resource

Our new water targets will help us be more transparent about our water usage and  
our water risk profile, management and challenges. They will also help us improve the datasets 
 we need to drive good water stewardship, and our performance over the next five years – 
 through a programme of risk awareness and response.

Our group target
By 2023, we will disclose for  
all managed operations:

Communities

helping people drive their own progress

We engage communities in ways that are inclusive, respecting dignity, rights, culture and way of life.  
We aim to maximise social and economic development and minimise potential issues, such as noise and dust. 
Our vision is to strengthen communities so they can sustain and drive their own progress.

transparency leads to greater 
accountability, and builds trust.

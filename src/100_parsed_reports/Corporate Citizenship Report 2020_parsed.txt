Values and Ethics

Leading by example

2020 was a year unlike any other, one that called on us to respond to profound global 
disruption with the fullness of our humanity, our resiliency and ingenuity, and our keen 
sense of social responsibility. While these values are constants at Oracle, I’m especially 
proud of our corporate citizenship achievements as I reflect on the past year.

Great Place to Work Institute, as well as a 
100 percent rating on the Human Rights 
Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality 
Index for the fourteenth consecutive year.

Inherent in every crisis are the seeds of opportunity—for creativity and problem solving, 
for caring and altruism—and Oracle employees seized those opportunities, every day, all 
around the world.

Philanthropically, we were unwavering in our support of thousands of nonprofit and 
nongovernmental organizations worldwide. When demand on foodbanks, shelters, and 
health organizations surged, these organizations knew they could depend on our steady 
support. When lockdowns upended in-person educational, environmental, and community 
programs, we offered general operating support to help our grantees adapt their programs 
and weather the storm.

During this time, Oracle Volunteers have donated more hours than ever before, even as 
they swiftly adapted in March 2020 to 100 percent virtual and contactless volunteering. I’m 
inspired by the many creative ways our employees banded together to help others. They 
taught classes online, translated educational materials into multiple languages, and  
became virtual mentors for students, young professionals, and emerging entrepreneurs. 
They took to crafting, making personal protective equipment for essential workers, and 
clothing and prosthetics for patients in need. They turned solo walks on the beach and on 
the trail into cleanups. They gave special attention to the most vulnerable. They opened 
their wallets, gave more generously than ever, and leveraged Oracle matching gifts to 
amplify their donations.

Our education initiatives—Oracle Academy and Oracle Education Foundation—proved 
to be vital in helping students thrive in this challenging environment. Oracle Academy, 
which provides educational institutions with free access to a variety of curriculum and 
technologies, including Oracle Cloud, continued to deliver resources to educators to keep 
students engaged virtually during the pandemic. Oracle Education Foundation transformed 
its in-person classes to virtual, expanded its offerings, engaged more Oracle Volunteers and 
students than ever, and continued to enthusiastically experiment in reinventing education.

Technologically, we play a critical role in 
helping our customers make a difference. 
Zoom, which is hosted on Oracle’s cloud 
infrastructure, has become a mainstay 
of commercial, educational, and social 
connection and productivity worldwide. 
The Therapeutic Learning System, which 
Oracle built and donated to the US government, is helping doctors track the effectiveness of 
COVID-19 drugs. Our partnership with the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change is helping 
African governments manage large-scale vaccination programs in the cloud, contain major 
diseases, and save lives; this ten-year commitment will provide free access to the Oracle 
Health Management system, which will also support COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.

Environmentally, we’re doubling down on our commitment to protect the planet. Our new, 
ambitious sustainability goals include a commitment to power Oracle Cloud with 100% 
renewable energy by 2025. Our technology is enabling organizations large and small, across 
industries, to operate sustainably and develop solutions to tackle climate change.

As demonstrated throughout this report, Oracle’s corporate citizenship efforts are steadfast, 
clear-eyed, and effective. We’re proud that our greatest assets—our people and our 
technology—change lives for the better, every day. If you’d like to share your feedback with 
us, please contact us at citizenship_ww@oracle.com.

Culturally, our employees’ well-being and success are of paramount importance. True to 
these priorities, we continue to invest in our people through ongoing career development, 
diversity and inclusion initiatives, and health and wellness programs designed to support 
them throughout the pandemic and beyond. These efforts earned us awards from the

Materiality

Oracle periodically conducts a materiality assessment in order to better identify and understand the areas where we should focus our efforts. This process helps us optimize the 
economic, environmental, and social performance required for long-term business success, while also enabling us to communicate Oracle’s value contribution and positive impact 
in the communities in which we operate.

As part of our assessment, we reference the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards to identify key sustainability benchmarks. We’re also guided by employee surveys and 
customers’ requests for proposals to identify issues that are most important to them.

“With unemployment doubling recently and youth unemployment exceeding 10 
percent during the pandemic, this year the difference the Oracle Academy program 
will make in the lives of students is their ability to find a job right as they graduate, 
as opposed to when the global economy will recover.”

School for Young Women Leaders in Austin, Texas. Additionally, the Foundation 
teamed up with Junior Achievement from August to October 2020 to deliver 
virtual classes for students across Latin America, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile, 
and Argentina. See the Latin America program in action.

Learning from anywhere

Throughout the global pandemic, the Foundation has remained steadfast in its 
commitment to serving students and their evolving needs. In March 2020, having 
previously experimented with dispersed learning, the Foundation quickly adapted 
to delivering classes virtually. It now moves fluidly between delivering in-person 
and virtual learning opportunities.

Haptic Directions—Navigating a new area can be challenging even for the most experienced traveler. Staring at 
your phone to navigate is a safety hazard that can lead to injuries between pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles. 
Haptic Directions is a portable, compact device that gives you turn-by-turn directions through a series of 
vibrations. This device can benefit travelers, the visually impaired, and most everyone else. 

Journey of a Cancer Cell—Cancer is a frightening diagnosis, especially for children who may not fully understand 
the causes, prognosis, and treatments. Journey of a Cancer Cell is an educational game for children that follows a 
cancerous cell as it develops and travels through the human body. Throughout the game, information about cancer 
is presented in child-friendly ways, and mini-games help deepen the player’s understanding of cancer. 

Pitchimo—Each year, thousands of baseball players suffer preventable repetitive motion injuries caused by 
overhand throwing. These injuries can lead to painful surgery, rehabilitation, and loss of playing time. Pitchimo is 
a smart compression sleeve that alerts players and trainers to potential problems—before an injury occurs. With 
Pitchimo, muscle sensors monitor fatigue and an inertial measurement unit monitors body mechanics and the 
force of throws. 

Branch—Emergency preparedness is a vital part of running any school. Branch is a seamless Internet of Things 
(IoT) solution for teachers and faculty to implement emergency response protocols, classroom controls, facilities 
management, and student information services with the touch of a button, all on a simple dashboard. Branch 
allows teachers and students to focus their time on learning rather than worrying about potential emergencies.

causes and solutions are common. Hard Choices is an educational game that puts the player in the shoes of one 
of our low-income Bay Area residents. The players develop empathy as they experience a multitude of factors 
that result in homelessness and housing insecurity.  

Redd the Travel Bot—California’s redwoods, the tallest and largest trees on Earth, are home to a myriad of species 
of plants and animals, and yet their conservation and care remains an issue. It’s challenging to mobilize people to 
protect this essential ecosystem without first experiencing its beauty and power. Redd is a chatbot, built on Oracle 
Digital Assistant, designed to help people plan a trip to California’s redwood forests and learn simultaneously. 

Auto Flöte Clean—Proper maintenance of musical instruments increases their lifespan and preserves the 
proper tones. Auto Flöte Clean is an automated flute-cleaning machine that takes a time consuming, boring 
chore and makes it easy and fun. Comprised of four 3D printed components, it uses Arduino programming 
and mechanical engineering to detect and clean each part of the flute.

Design Tech High School at Oracle

Creativity, adaptability, and innovation are some of the defining qualities of the students of Design Tech High School (d.tech). Oracle has a deep relationship 
with this pioneering California public charter school—we built a home for them on our campus in 2018. The school’s mission is to develop students who believe 
that the world can be a better place, and that they can be the ones to help make it happen.

Built to adapt

Schools around the world shifted to distance learning in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, and d.tech was no exception. With design thinking being a 
core practice, the entire school has been resilient and adaptable in its approach 
to learning. To enhance the distance learning experience, d.tech created a 
schedule that allows students to cycle through three courses at a time instead 
of the usual six, allowing them to focus in more depth on fewer subjects. In 
addition, staff are being equipped with new technology to produce high-quality 
virtual learning experiences.

Intersession: the secret sauce

The Intersession program is one of the defining d.tech educational experiences. 
Three times a year, students explore new disciplines and industries through 
classes offered by local nonprofits, large and small businesses, and individual 
professionals. Students can choose from a wide range of classes such as exploring 
insect science with an entomologist from Stanford University; understanding how 
to build fire-resistant homes with help from local architects; and learning coding, 
physical computing, and human-centered design skills from the Oracle Education 
Foundation. Throughout the pandemic, Intersession has continued virtually.

Purposeful design thinking

Design thinking is an empathy-based approach to problem-solving that 
involves iterative prototyping, which is central to d.tech’s curriculum. By using 
the tools of design thinking across all academic subject areas, d.tech students 
learn to create the change they want to see in the world. Students are also 
deeply interested in finding ways to make a difference, and d.tech’s design-
thinking curriculum was developed to support innovation in areas including 
global health, the environment, and racial justice.

Oracle Volunteers at d.tech

Oracle Volunteers always feel at home at d.tech. Beyond their involvement in 
Intersession, Oracle Volunteers donate their time and talents to support students 
year-round. These activities include engaging students in sustainability discussions, 
helping students develop presentation skills, serving on college and career panels, 
signing up as Spanish-language conversation partners, and even using their skills to 
develop a software solution for scheduling the Intersession program.

22 marine reserves spanning nearly six million square kilometers. This allows 
biodiversity to flourish and will help protect species from extinction.

We also fund The Marine Mammal Center’s Global Response Initiative, which 
rescues entangled whales, seals, and sea lions, and The Nature Conservancy’s  
work to restore kelp forest ecosystems in California.

Protecting and restoring land

Thriving forest ecosystems are critical to maintaining a healthy planet. They 
protect wildlife habitats, improve waterway health, and build resilience against 
drought and fire. Oracle supports Save the Redwoods League’s Redwoods  
Rising program to restore more than 70,000 acres of degraded redwood forest 
across California.

Local to our offices, we fund organizations such as California State Parks 
Foundation and Keep Austin Beautiful, which engage volunteers as stewards of 
the natural world.

Supporting 30 years of gorilla 
conservation

Since 1990, Oracle has supported the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International  
(Fossey Fund) and its protection of gorillas and their habitats in Rwanda and the 
Democratic Republic of Congo.

Often called “the lungs of the Earth,” the rainforests gorillas call home are critical  
to building climate resilience for the planet. By protecting gorillas and their habitat, 
we also protect ourselves. As the Fossey Fund’s work continues during the  
COVID-19 pandemic, the organization has implemented new protocols to ensure the 
health and safety of field staff and gorillas.

Oracle also hosts all of the Fossey Fund’s data—one of the world’s largest collections 
of data on any wild animal—for free. Data is globally accessible to scientists at no cost.  
It’s also featured in the Oracle Education Foundation’s data visualization workshops.

Achieving a zero-waste future

As a global society, we generate two billion tons of waste each year, about 
a third of which ends up in landfills. Of that, at least eight million tons of 
unrecycled plastics end up in the ocean. The environmental cost of this is 
staggering—driving up carbon emissions, exacerbating the global plastic 
pollution crisis, and negatively impacting marine life and human health.

To turn the tide, we support several organizations working to achieve a 
zero-waste future. Our grantees include Wecyclers, a social enterprise in 
Lagos, Nigeria that incentivizes waste recycling in densely populated urban 
neighborhoods, and the WEEE Centre in Nairobi, Kenya, which promotes public 
awareness of the environmental and health hazards of e-waste and educates 
the public about reuse, recycling, and safe disposal. We also support California 
Coastal Cleanup Day and Eco-Cycle in Boulder, Colorado.

Connecting youth to  
the environment

We support nonprofit organizations that inspire the next generation of 
environmental stewards through environmental education and immersive 
outdoor experiences for students. Our grantees include Children’s Discovery 
Museum, CuriOdyssey, Foundation for Environmental Education Japan, Junior 
Achievement Kenya, Marine Science Institute, Mirai no Mori, NatureBridge,  
and Wildmind.

Causes we support 

“Over the past five years, Oracle has generously supported our mission through 
volunteerism as well as meaningful grants that have enabled us to expand our 
Inspiring Minds program. With Oracle’s support, we’ve been able to successfully shift 
our focus during the pandemic to provide emergency essentials for families in need.”

—Carina Martin, CEO and Founder, A Precious Child

Delivering emergency essentials

Neighborhood and community organizations are the cornerstone of a healthy 
society, and their services are vital, particularly in times of crisis. Many of our 
grantees offer safety for vulnerable people by providing shelter, hygiene kits, 
meals, and other essential resources. These groups include A Precious Child, 
Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Goonj, LifeMoves, Nashua Soup Kitchen and 
Shelter, and UNICEF India.

Increasing access to nutritious food

For 30 years, Oracle has supported food banks in the places we call home. Their

organizations including the Alameda County Community Food Bank, Central 
Texas Food Bank, Greater Boston Food Bank, Second Harvest Food Bank, and 
Voedselbank Amsterdam.

Amplifying our employees’ philanthropy 

“Leveraging Oracle’s matching gifts program goes a long way in extending the 

impact of your personal donation. By having Oracle match my donation to Louisville 
Community Foundation, we were able to buy 140 winter jackets, hats, and gloves 
for children in our community to help ensure every child has access to comfort and 
warmth. A big thanks to Oracle for helping us touch the lives of those in need.”

—Greg Anderson, Group Vice President, North America Applications Solution Engineering, Oracle

Matching employee donations

Oracle supports its employees’ philanthropy by matching their personal 
charitable donations to causes around the world. We matched more than US$4 
million in employee donations in FY20.

Disaster relief

When a disaster occurs, Oracle matches employee donations to disaster relief 
dollar for dollar. Oracle and its employees contributed more than US$500K in 
response to natural disasters in Australia, the Bahamas, Brazil, India, Japan, and 
the United States.

Responding to the pandemic

During the pandemic, Oracle employees all over the world banded together to 
support causes in their communities. They donated to local food banks and 
community centers as well as to global organizations providing emergency 
relief. Together with the company match, employees donated more than US$1M 
to COVID-19 relief efforts from March through May 2020.

provided 37 hardship grants totaling more than US$92K, helping employees 
recover from natural disasters, loss of a loved one, and serious injury or illness, 
including COVID-19.

“When my family home burned down, we lost everything. The financial support I 
received through Oracle Cares helped cover our mortgage while we focused on 
covering and replacing our basic necessities.”

The excellent organizations we support

When it comes to philanthropy, we don’t wait for the right people to find us. Instead, we actively seek out nonprofit, nonreligious, and nonpolitical 
organizations that match our philanthropic focus areas, and invite them to submit grant proposals. We are proud to support this portfolio of excellent 
organizations working to advance education, protect the environment, and strengthen communities around the world. Many of our grantees have 
stepped up to support vulnerable populations which are disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.

Volunteering anywhere, to support

All year long, Oracle Volunteers around the world act on their desire to help 
people and the planet around them by undertaking virtual and in-person 
projects. They support causes close to their hearts, such as mentoring students 
in coding, planting trees, keeping parks and beaches litter-free, or reaching out 
to elders through letters and phone calls.

Making a world of difference,  
from home

In response to the pandemic, employees around the world are stepping up to 
support their neighbors, loved ones, and those in need. They’re making masks 
and face shields, writing letters to boost elders’ morale, donating to causes and 
having the donations matched by Oracle Giving, tutoring students, helping 
nonprofits shift to virtual operations, and much more.

Building connections. Sharing knowledge. 
Amplifying impact.

The Corporate Citizenship Communities program unites employees who share a 
passion for giving back. Bringing them together in locales around the world, these 
communities are established at the grassroots level and guided by local leaders. 
Launched in 2019, it’s now 32 communities strong—and growing.

Preparing youth for the future  
of work

Mentoring, career workshops, and mock interviews are just a few ways Oracle 
employees empower youth to explore new and exciting professional paths. 
The Oracle Education Foundation’s program is a perfect example of this type 
of “skillanthropy” in action. It engages Oracle Volunteers in coaching high 
school students through multiday classes at the intersection of coding, physical 
computing, and design thinking.

Doing well by doing good

Our employees know better than anyone what their communities need. That’s why 
every full-time employee at Oracle may volunteer up to 40 hours a year during 
their scheduled work time, and many donate thousands of hours beyond that. 
Plus, through Oracle Giving, we match our employees’ charitable donations to 
causes around the world up to US$1,000 per employee per year.

Causes we support 

“With the Oracle Volunteering program, I can pursue my career at Oracle and 
make a difference. Not only do I have opportunities to help students learn 
English and coding, I also get to collaborate virtually with wonderful volunteers 
across regions. We can take volunteering activities to another level, helping 
more people in need in new ways.”

—Mohamad Rizal Arryadi, Corporate Citizenship Community Leader, Indonesia

Supporting the shift to  
distance learning

We believe learning can happen anywhere, and we want to make that possible 
for students everywhere. To make this a reality, Oracle Volunteers produce 
televised lessons for students in rural India, provide learning experiences for 
students in Latin America and Europe, and lead virtual classes and mentoring 
sessions all over the world. Organizations we support include Going to School,

Increasing inclusion in STEAM

Many Oracle Volunteers give special attention to promoting diversity and 
inclusion in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEAM) careers. 
In projects around the world, they seek out opportunities to support girls and 
other historically underrepresented groups of students. Organizations we work 
with include Black Girls Code, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Girls Who Code, 
Raspberry Pi Foundation, Women’s Technology Empowerment Centre, and  
many schools.

Preparing tomorrow’s workforce

Oracle employees know that the world of work is constantly evolving, with new 
business models, technologies, and workers’ changing expectations. As Oracle 
Volunteers, they want to help young people thrive in both the present and 
future of work. They do this by conducting mock interviews with engineering 
students, hosting resume-writing workshops, participating in career talks, 
mentoring, and more. Organizations we support include Boys & Girls Clubs of 
America, Bridge for Smile, Design Tech High School, Foundation for Excellence, 
Fundación Forge Argentina, Instituto PROA, Learning for All, Magic Bus, Mentor 
Arabia, and Per Scholas.

“Whatever your passion is, you can turn it into volunteering. The ocean is a place 
where I spend a lot of my free time, and I want it to be clean. Even if you pick up 
just one piece of plastic, you’re helping.”

—Kevin Parrington, Oracle Volunteering Project Leader, Japan

Protecting our oceans

By 2050, plastic in the oceans will outweigh the fish, predicts a report from 
the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in partnership with the World Economic 
Forum. That is, unless we do something. That’s why Oracle Volunteers around 
the world head to their beaches, coastlines, and river banks to remove trash. 
Organizations we team up with include California Coastal Commission, Going 
to School, Heal the Bay, Keep Collier Beautiful, Pacific Beach Coalition, and the 
SEGO Initiative.

Greening our planet

Trees clean the air we breathe, filter the water we drink, and provide habitat 
to more than 80% of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity. For these reasons and 
more, Oracle Volunteers plant and care for trees around the world, including 
along the shores of Agara Lake in Bengaluru, India, at Lady Bird Lake in Austin, 
Texas, and in neighborhoods around Durham, North Carolina. Organizations we 
volunteer with include Keep Austin Beautiful, Keep Durham Beautiful, SayTrees, 
and The Trail Foundation.

Keeping our parks clean

From stunning national parks to small neighborhood play areas, open space 
provides recreation, fun, peace, and a vital connection to nature. In an effort to 
keep these places beautiful, safe, and accessible, Oracle Volunteers help remove 
invasive species, plant native species, maintain trails, install new swing sets, and 
much more. Organizations we support include Culture, Recreation & Economic 
Services, Fundatia Sinergii pentru Viitor, National Trust, Parque Natural y 
Nacional de Sierra Nevada, and Pease Park Conservancy.

Promoting sustainable farming

Sustainable farms encourage biodiversity, conserve scarce water resources, and 
build healthy soil through techniques such as composting and planting cover 
crops. Many sustainable farms also make fresh produce available to those with 
limited access. From Ilion, Greece to Austin, Texas, from Dania Beach, Florida 
to Zapopan, Mexico—Oracle Volunteers plant and tend crops and prepare fresh 
meals with this produce. We volunteer with organizations such as HandsOn 
Broward, Organization Earth, Urban Roots, and many others.

Ultimately, we all hope to be older people. Oracle Volunteers value and respect 
elders and connect with them by chatting, writing letters, playing games, 
and crafting together. During the COVID-19 pandemic—a time of heightened 
isolation and vulnerability for older people—volunteers continue to connect 
creatively and safely. We engage with organizations such as AGE of Central 
Texas, Friends of the Elderly, and Fundación Herrera.

Working to end food insecurity

According to the United Nations World Food Programme, 821 million people—
or 1 in 9 individuals—experience food insecurity globally. This is a reality that 
motivates Oracle Volunteers around the world to support local food banks and 
free meal programs. Volunteers host food drives, sort donations, and distribute 
food to the community in support of Central Texas Food Bank, Greater 
Vancouver Food Bank, North Paddington Foodbank, Rise Against Hunger 
Philippines, Second Harvest Food Bank, and Voedselbank Amsterdam, among 
others.

Message from our Chief Sustainability Officer

The year 2020 will undoubtedly go down in history as a watershed moment in our time. 
As a global community, we’ve faced immense challenges, hardships, and grief. In addition, 
many inequities that existed prior to the pandemic have been laid bare.

Awareness of our impact on nature is now greater than ever. A tiny virus spilled out of the 
wild, and through human activity spread rapidly across the globe—changing life as we 
know it. We continue to see wildfires of unprecedented scale and destructiveness, as well as 
catastrophic storms that devastate coastal regions with increasing frequency. Our oceans 
and waterways are being polluted with immense amounts of waste, including discarded 
plastics, with potentially catastrophic effects on ecosystems and wildlife, all of this made 
worse by habitat loss and reduction in biodiversity. Attitudes are changing and new 
solutions are emerging; corporations such as Oracle are increasingly united in addressing 
these challenges as part of their strategic plans. As we continue our path forward at Oracle, 
we will embrace this opportunity to build a better future—for people, for the planet, and for 
businesses.

datasheet, and see our new, ambitious goals for 2025. These goals challenge us to do 
even more to address climate change and create a more circular economy based on the 
principles of designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and 
regenerating natural systems. One of these goals includes powering Oracle Cloud  
with 100% renewable energy. To better understand our financial risks, we have also 
conducted a risk assessment using the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) framework.

We are proud of the positive impact we’re making. But there’s still much to be done, and we 
remain committed to the work of building a more sustainable future. We know that the use 
of technology will play a critical role in meeting the ambitious United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals, and Oracle stands ready to help enable our customers to do so.

We hope you find this report both informative and inspiring.

Together, we can make a difference.

Throughout this report, you’ll read about the incredible collaboration among our many 
stakeholders—employees, customers, and partners—to identify and address our most 
material impacts. You’ll learn about the progress we’re making as presented in our

A key tenet of the circular economy is to decouple physical assets from the services they provide. 
Individuals or organizations do not necessarily need to physically own computing hardware, they just 
need to have the ability to compute. This is exactly what the cloud delivers.

Design for the environment. 

We keep the environment in mind as  
we design and develop our hardware  
products. As part of this process, we assess a 
number of product characteristics including energy 
efficiency, dematerialization, serviceability, and 
recyclability.

Consolidate. Simplify. Optimize. 

The transition to the cloud enables us  
to consolidate our data centers and  
avoid on-premises deployments at hundreds of 
thousands of disparate sites. This, in turn, helps us 
minimize packaging and simplify the logistics for new  
hardware delivery, spare parts management, and  
removing end-of-life hardware for reuse or recycling.

Maximize resource utilization. 

By having greater visibility and control  
over the hardware at the end of its useful  
life, Oracle is able to more effectively repurpose 
equipment, harvest spare parts, and extract resources,  
all while strictly adhering to Oracle’s data privacy and  
security practices. Our ongoing capacity planning 
also enables us to increase utilization densities.

Greenhouse gas emissions

Emission total

Emissions reduction is a key component of our sustainability strategy. Since 
2015, we’ve reduced our carbon footprint by 20.5 percent—the result of increased 
renewable energy use, improved energy and lighting efficiency, onsite solar 
installations, engagement with our suppliers, and a variety of other emissions 
reduction initiatives across our operations. This puts us well on track to meet 
our 2025 goal to achieve a 26% reduction in emissions, which is aligned with the 
Science-Based Target Initiative’s 2°C scenario. We are also on track to meet the 
1.5°C scenario.

In FY20, we added the Oracle Austin Waterfront campus to our list of buildings 
with 100% renewable electricity use. We now have more than 80 offices globally 
with electric vehicle charging stations to help meet our employees’ needs.

Highlights

Procurement

We recognize that our purchasing decisions can have a significant social and environmental impact. Oracle’s Supplier Code of Ethics and 
Business Conduct requires our suppliers to observe the law and conduct business in an ethical and responsible manner. We also have a 
robust program to manage our IT assets, including the recovery and recycling of office equipment and phones at the end of their useful life. 
Oracle’s travel and promotional items portals proactively identify sustainable alternatives for employees to consider. Our catering partners 
aim to source food locally where feasible.

Logistics

We work closely with our logistics partners to minimize shipments, maximize consolidation, and take sustainability into account when 
selecting among modes of transportation, including lower emissions options such as bio-liquefied natural gas (LNG). By engaging with our 
logistics partners we’ve reduced logistics-related emissions by more than 40% since 2015. We expect this trend to continue with the shift to 
cloud computing.

Supplier engagement

As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), Oracle manages and monitors our direct hardware supply chain in accordance 
with the RBA Code of Conduct. In FY20, 15 audits based on the RBA Code of Conduct were completed at direct hardware supplier factory 
locations. Each year, we engage with our strategic suppliers to report data on their carbon, water, and waste footprints via the RBA platform, 
a process that helps us evaluate and manage potential risks in our supply chain. Oracle is also an active member of the RBA Environmental 
Sustainability working group, helping develop strategies and tools to improve environmental impact measurement, drive resource 
efficiency, and build industry capacity and performance.

Oracle solutions

Technologies are enabling insights for intelligent decision-making—including 
environmental impact considerations—that were thought to be cost-prohibitive 
and impossible at scale. Oracle solutions help optimize resource management, 
value-chain execution, environmental analytics and reporting, and many 
other areas. We know that technology will play a crucial role in achieving the 
United Nation’s ambitious Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, including 
rethinking the delivery of goods and services in a more circular economy. The 
Oracle NetSuite Social Impact program offers nonprofits and social enterprises 
software donations and pro bono services to accelerate impact.

Employee giving

Oracle supports its employees’ philanthropy by matching their personal charitable 
donations up to US$1,000 per employee annually. Additionally, when a disaster 
occurs—including climate-related natural disasters—Oracle matches employee 
donations to relief efforts dollar for dollar. Oracle matched US$4 million in employee 
donations globally in FY20.

Working sustainably everywhere

Communication tools. Oracle provides 
employees with tools that enable a 
seamless remote work experience, 
which is proving especially valuable 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. This 
includes numerous audio and video 
teleconferencing options.

Commuting. Oracle facilities worldwide 
offer myriad initiatives to reduce the 
environmental impacts of commuting, 
including bike-to-work programs, electric 
vehicle charging stations, bike sharing—
including e-bikes—and carpooling 
programs.

Travel. Oracle has a policy to limit 
employee travel, which enables us to not 
only reduce our business expenses, but 
also reduce our carbon emissions. We now 
have a goal to achieve a 25% reduction in 
employee air travel emissions by 2025. We 
actively engage with airline, hotel, and car 
rental business partners to minimize our 
impact on the environment.

Our response to COVID-19 and beyond

Weathering the pandemic has necessitated levels of resilience and collaboration that are unmatched in most of our lifetimes.  
Though we continue to face disruption and challenges, Oracle and its employees remain steadfast and strong,  
stepping up to support our communities, colleagues, and customers.

Helping to strengthen public health

Recording health information on vaccinations and disease treatments can help 
save lives. By working together with the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, 
Oracle is providing three African nations—Ghana, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone—
with a modern, cloud-based, electronic health records system to help them 
manage their large-scale vaccination programs, contain major diseases, and save 
lives. The ten-year commitment will provide free access to the Oracle Health 
Management system, which will also support COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.

Supporting our communities

The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak has been immense on all fronts—economic, 
societal, and humanitarian. Through our philanthropy, we’re helping our 
grantees focus their resources and services where they’re needed most. In India, 
we donated more than US$6.8 million to nonprofit organizations providing 
immediate relief and rehabilitation to migrant workers, women, and children.

We continue to support effective nonprofit organizations advancing education, 
protecting the environment, and strengthening communities in other parts of 
the world, including in the US, Japan, Kenya, Nigeria, and across Latin America. 
Many of our grantees have stepped up to support vulnerable populations that 
are disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.

Employees making a difference

Whether on Zoom, on the phone, or through offline, self-paced projects, 
volunteering is evolving and adapting. Through acts of kindness large and small, 
Oracle Volunteers have found new ways to make a difference in their communities. 

Additionally, employees have donated millions of dollars to nonprofit 
organizations globally in the fight against COVID-19. Together with the company 
match, employees donated more than US$1 million to support COVID-19 relief 
efforts from March through May 2020.

Helping in the fight against COVID-19 with Oracle Cloud

Oracle customers, partners, startups, and research collaborators are on the frontlines of the fight against the pandemic. Oracle has joined forces with hospitals, governments, 
research institutions, essential businesses, and others to meet new challenges.

More than 1,000 employees helped build the Therapeutic Learning System, a technology solution to aid doctors in determining which drugs are effective in treating or preventing 
infection. The Therapeutic Learning System was deployed on March 30, 2020, and is the result of a unique and significant collaboration with US agencies including the National 
Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and the Department of Health and 
Human Services.

Oracle for Startups stepped up to help startups during the pandemic and quickly witnessed how startups in turn helped others, from making their solutions free to pursuing 
COVID-19 treatments. Oracle for Research worked with researchers to predict the spread of the virus and accelerate drug and vaccine discovery, with fast access to high 
performance computing, artificial intelligence, and technical advising. And across the globe, Oracle employees supported COVID-related projects proposed by their customers  
and partners.

Throughout the pandemic, data and the tools to understand and use it have been essential to fight the virus, keep businesses and economies open, and connect people. To date, 
Oracle has donated millions of dollars of Oracle Cloud resources to support COVID-related projects from contact tracing to developing effective vaccines.

During this time, Oracle Volunteers have donated more hours than ever before, even as they swiftly adapted in March 2020 to 100 percent virtual and contactless volunteering.

I’m inspired by the many creative ways our employees banded together to help others.

They taught classes online, translated educational materials into multiple languages, and became virtual mentors for students, young professionals, and emerging entrepreneurs.

They took to crafting, making personal protective equipment for essential workers, and clothing and prosthetics for patients in need.

They gave special attention to the most vulnerable.

They opened their wallets, gave more generously than ever, and leveraged Oracle matching gifts to amplify their donations.

Creativity, adaptability, and innovation are some of the defining qualities of the students of Design Tech High School (d.tech).

Oracle has a deep relationship with this pioneering California public charter school we built a home for them on our campus in 2018.

The school’s mission is to develop students who believe that the world can be a better place, and that they can be the ones to help make it happen.

Schools around the world shifted to distance learning in response to the COVID 19 pandemic, and d.tech was no exception.

With design thinking being a core practice, the entire school has been resilient and adaptable in its approach to learning.

To enhance the distance learning experience, d.tech created a schedule that allows students to cycle through three courses at a time instead of the usual six, allowing them to focus in more depth on fewer subjects.

In addition, staff are being equipped with new technology to produce high quality virtual learning experiences.

The Intersession program is one of the defining d.tech educational experiences.

Three times a year, students explore new disciplines and industries through classes offered by local nonprofits, large and small businesses, and individual professionals.

Students can choose from a wide range of classes such as exploring insect science with an entomologist from Stanford University understanding how to build fire resistant homes with help from local architects and learning coding, physical computing, and human centered design skills from the Oracle Education Foundation.

Throughout the pandemic, Intersession has continued virtually.

Design thinking is an empathy based approach to problem solving that involves iterative prototyping, which is central to d.tech’s curriculum.

By using the tools of design thinking across all academic subject areas, d.tech students learn to create the change they want to see in the world.

Students are also deeply interested in finding ways to make a difference, and d.tech’s design thinking curriculum was developed to support innovation in areas including global health, the environment, and racial justice.

Beyond their involvement in Intersession, Oracle Volunteers donate their time and talents to support students year round.

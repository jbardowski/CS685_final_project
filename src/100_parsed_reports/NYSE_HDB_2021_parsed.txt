Leading  
Responsibly

At HDFC Bank, good corporate 
governance is at the heart of 
responsible leadership, enabling us 
to inspire trust among stakeholders 
while fulfilling aspirations of 
customers through good times 
and tough. Guided by our belief 
in shared prosperity, we leverage 
balance sheet strength with an 
unwavering focus on asset quality 
to deliver sustained growth while 
making a meaningful difference to 
the lives we touch.

In a year like no other, we mobilised 
our financial and operational 
resources to participate in the 
nation’s fight against the pandemic. 
We facilitated Government welfare 
measures to reach the remotest 
beneficiary through our unparalleled 
reach while contributing to the 
economic rebound. 

Our commitment to delivering large-
scale positive impact prompted 
us to include sustainability as 
one of our core values. We 
remain focused on growing while 
reducing our carbon footprint 
through responsible actions and 
undertaking targeted interventions for 
sustainable development. 

With a new leadership at the helm, we 
are building on our execution muscle 
by creating future growth engines 
focusing on business verticals 
and delivery channels, with digital 
technology being the driving force. 
We will ‘Run’ and ‘Build the Bank’ of 
the future while staying responsible 
at the forefront of transformation in 
India’s banking landscape.

This Integrated Annual Report for  
2020-21 endeavours to provide a holistic 
assessment of the Bank’s financial and 
non-financial performance. It also outlines 
relevant information on the Bank’s strategy, 
governance, risks and prospects to offer 
better insights into its activities and 
progress. The Bank has been voluntarily 
reporting its sustainability performance 
annually since FY14, as a separate report. 
From this year onwards, our sustainability 
performance is also included entirely in this 
report.

responsible 
leadership

Leadership comes with 
great responsibility. As 
a systemically important 
Bank, we are committed 
to contributing to the 
Indian growth story while 
exercising prudence  
to create sustained value  
for all our stakeholders.  
This commitment is reflected 
in our steadily expanding 
balance sheet, which is the 
second largest amongst banks 
in India, while maintaining 
strong asset quality.

Our robust fundamentals enabled us to deliver 
banking services to our customers during 
the pandemic while supporting individuals 
and small businesses to ride out the storm 
— extending moratorium on repayments, 
facilitating loan restructuring and lending 
support to the Government’s ECLGS scheme.

We are also actively participating in the nation’s 
inclusive development agenda through focused 
interventions to improve life and livelihood 
opportunities. Joining in the fight against 
the pandemic, we are also helping build a 
healthcare ecosystem aimed at ensuring 
the health and wellbeing of our employees, 
customers and society at large. As we enhance 
our future-readiness and drive the next wave of 
growth, we remain anchored to our core values, 
good governance practices, and continue 
to make a difference to the lives of people 
through our social initiatives under HDFC Bank 
Parivartan. Towards our commitment to protect 
the environment, we pledge to become carbon 
neutral by FY32.

About Us

Responsible banking  
in a changing world

HDFC Bank is the largest private sector bank (by Balance Sheet size) in India offering 
a comprehensive range of financial products and services to a diverse customer 
base. Our unparalleled reach, coupled with our digital capabilities, enables us to 
serve the evolving needs of our customers across the country, even in an extremely 
challenging environment. 

Business verticals

Retail

Wholesale

Treasury

The Retail Business operated 
under extremely challenging 
circumstances in the year under 
review. This business is directly 
linked to consumption which slowed 
down during the lockdown. As 
the ‘unlocking phase’ gathered 
momentum, the business recovered 
and posted a healthy growth on 
a sequential-quarter basis in Q4. 
Domestic retail advances grew by 
6.7% (Y-o-Y) to over `5.27 Lakh 
Crore. This constituted about 47% 
of the Bank’s domestic loans as per 
Basel II classification.

Our Wholesale Banking business 
serves institutional customers such 
as Government, Large and Emerging 
Corporates, SMEs and was our key 
growth driver in FY21. Our strong 
offerings include Working Capital 
and Term Loans, Trade Credit, 
Cash Management, Supply Chain 
Financing, Foreign Exchange, and 
Investment Banking Services.

Domestic Wholesale Banking 
advances recorded a healthy 21.7% 
growth, ending FY21 with a loan 
book of over `5.83 Lakh Crore. 
This constituted about 53% of the 
Bank’s domestic loans as per Basel 
II classification.

The Treasury is the custodian 
of the Bank’s cash/liquid assets 
and handles our investments in 
securities, foreign exchange and 
cash instruments. It also manages 
liquidity and interest rate risks on 
the balance sheet and ensures 
the Bank meets its reserve 
requirements. The Treasury also 
caters to our customers’ needs in 
managing foreign exchange rate 
and interest rate risks, generating 
fee income from the services 
rendered. The Treasury recorded 
revenue of `2,438.4 Crore from 
foreign exchange and derivative 
transactions during FY21.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations are embedded 
in our growth strategy, which reflects our unwavering commitment towards a 
sustainable future.

Farewell Note to Mr. Aditya Puri

Aditya Puri,

Ex-Managing Director
HDFC Bank Limited

Dear Mr. Puri,
Sometimes words are not enough to express the 
influence you have had in building HDFC Bank into 
an industry bellwether in 25 years. Yet, as you leave 
behind your indelible imprint on everything we do today, 
we extend the humble two words of ‘thank you’ to 
express our gratitude for making us an integral part of a 
transformative journey. The roadmap you have given us 
– we will tread on that.

The journey that began during the initial phase of India’s 
liberalisation now connects the many Bharats that 
live within. As we take confident strides into a rapidly 
changing digital world with a customer first approach, 
knowledge, simplicity, empathy in our DNA, we remain 
true to your legacy – upholding the highest standards in 
corporate governance, inspiring actions for meaningful 
social impact, nurturing talent and continuing to be one 
of India’s most trusted and valuable brands.

Thank you once again for giving us the confidence 
that “the best of the Bank is yet to come.”

Our Focus Areas:

and Customers 

Sashidhar Jagdishan
Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer
HDFC Bank Limited

Dear Stakeholders,

Let me start by wishing all of you good 
health and happiness. The financial year 
gone by has taught all of us to value 
this more than anything else. Many of 
you may have lost your near and dear 
ones. My heartfelt condolences to all 
of you. We in the HDFC Bank family 
too have lost several colleagues. My 
head bows in grief and sorrow. We are 
supporting and will continue to support 
their families. 

The year gone by saw people across 
the world being largely confined to their 
homes with several travel restrictions in 
place. They faced myriad personal and 
professional challenges perhaps never 
before encountered in our lifetime. This 
obviously had an effect on the economy 
with the world officially being plunged 
into recession.

Governments and Central Banks across 
the world reacted introducing a range 
of measures to revive the economy and 
help people move forward.

Challenging Environment 

Our country was no exception. The 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the 
Government introduced a slew of 
measures to revive the economy. 
These measures bore fruit with the 
economy growing by 1.6 per cent in 
the fourth quarter of the year while it 
had contracted by 24.4 per cent at the 
end of the first quarter. In the current 
financial year India is expected to be 
one of the fastest growing economies 
in the world. The second wave of the 
pandemic has dented the optimism 
a bit, but the peak of the pandemic 
clearly appears to be behind us. As the 
vaccine rollout gathers momentum, the 
economy is expected to be on a much 
stronger footing especially from the 
second quarter. 

Our Performance

Areas for Improvement 

We posted a healthy growth in Net 
Profit, Net Interest Income and Balance 
Sheet size without compromising on 
asset quality. Net Profit increased by 
18.5 per cent to `31,116.5 Crore in  
FY21 and balance sheet size by 14.1 
per cent to `1,746,871 Crore. Gross 
NPAs increased to 1.32 per cent in 
FY21 from 1.26 per cent in the previous 
year. Net interest income, an indication 
of the difference between interest 
earned and interest paid grew by 15.5 
per cent to `64,879.6 Crore. The details 
of our performance are elaborated in 
the report. 

I am proud of my colleagues and thank 
all of them (and their families too) for 
this performance despite, the difficulties 
they had to face during the year. As an 
organisation we learnt and relearnt on 
the way, pivoted our way to a Work from 
Home culture and continued to serve 
our customers. I am delighted by the 
way our colleagues responded to the 
myriad challenges we all faced.

Strengths 

At this point I would like to elaborate 
on some of our strengths and also talk 
about things that we could have done 
better. 

One of our biggest strengths has been 
the legacy of over a quarter century. 
Our iconic ex-Managing Director, Mr 
Aditya Puri created an institution with 
strong foundation and fundamentals. 
It is a huge advantage as well as a 
privilege to inherit and build upon this. 
Thanks to his leadership, we today 
have a strong balance sheet with 
among the lowest NPAs in the banking 
industry and strong capitalisation. This 
has helped us to lend even during 
difficult times, build market leadership 
and deliver shareholder value without 
compromising on our commitment to 
society and the environment. 

Technology. Quite frankly, it continues 
to remain both a strength as well as an 
area for improvement. In the last couple 
of years our technological capability 
has been questioned. Justifiably. But 
at the same time, we cannot afford 
to miss the big picture. We would not 
have become a Bank of this scale, size, 
and grown market share consistently 
year after year, without having a strong 
technology backbone. We are one 
of the largest transaction processing 
Banks and have come up with cutting 
edge customer solutions like 10-second 
personal loans and digital loan against 
mutual funds. Not to forget the rollout 
of Video KYC during the pandemic 
which helped people to become a 
bank customer from the safety of 
their homes. Or the DigiDemat and 
Trading Account which we introduced 
in partnership with our subsidiary 
last year. In the last 28 months, we 
have, however, been in the spotlight 
for the wrong reasons when it comes 
to technology. Also, there have been 
deficiencies in compliance.

The technology problems as well as 
the compliance issues have led to 
regulatory actions. This brings me to my 
focus areas. 

My Focus Areas 

The last technology downtime led to 
the Reserve Bank of India banning 
us from issuing new credit cards as 
well as putting on hold new launches 
under Digital 2.0 initiative. Further, the 
regulator also appointed a third party 
audit of our IT systems. This audit is 
now over and the report has been 
submitted to the regulator. We now 
await the decision from RBI.

As a Bank we are certainly sorry for 
what has happened. And have taken 
this as an opportunity to improve and 
redouble our efforts to fix this problem 
for good. We have now embarked on 
a scale changing technology adoption 

and transformation agenda to help 
drive our ambitious future growth plans. 
Some of the specific initiatives that we 
have embarked on in our Technology 
Transformation Agenda are:

1   Infrastructure Scalability: 
We have invested heavily in the scale 
up of our infrastructure to handle any 
potential load for the next 3/5 years. We 
are also in the process of accelerating 
our cloud strategy to be on the cutting 
edge leveraging best-in-class cloud 
service providers.

2   Disaster Recovery (DR) 
Resiliency: We have strengthened 
our process of monitoring our Data 
Centre (DC) and have shifted key 
applications to a new DC. This includes 
key consumer facing ones. We have 
strengthened the Disaster Recovery 
trials and processes so as to bounce 
back to serve our customers faster and 
quicker. 

3   Security Enhancements:  
We have strengthened our firewalls 
further. We have to be scanning  
the horizon for potential security  
issues and be ever prepared to face 
them. We haven’t had any security 
issues in the past. But this is always 
an important area of focus and 
action plans are underway for further 
robustness.

4   Monitoring Mechanisms: 
An enhanced application monitoring 
mechanism has been put in place 
across the board to enable us to keep 
our IT systems Always On. 

While we execute this Technology 
Transformation agenda, there will 
sometimes be pain and outages beyond 
our control. But this is the bitter pill we 
need to swallow. As mentioned earlier 
we are putting in place measures that 
will ensure that downtimes will not be 
prolonged. Yes, it will take some time 
but we will get around this. And live up 
to the standards that people have come 
to expect from us.

Compliance 

There has also been some 
discussion around the deficiencies 
in compliance regarding the selling 
of GPS products. For many years we 
had been bundling the financing of 
GPS systems and cars. The teams 
believed this was a routine lending 
activity. Also, a particular vendor had 
entered into an arrangement with us 
directly. These products were never 
sold on a standalone basis but only 
bundled along with the purchase of 
cars. In November 2019, a whistle 
blower alleged that the vendor was 
incentivising some of the employees 
in the auto loan team to bundle these 
products with our car loans. We 
immediately conducted an enquiry 
and basis the findings have taken 
necessary actions against the involved 
employees including termination of 
their services and also terminated the 
arrangement with the vendor. RBI in the 
meanwhile also issued a show cause 
notice in connection with the Bank’s 
arrangement with the vendor. They 
contended that such an arrangement 
was in violation of provisions of the 
Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and 
hence the Bank is liable for penal 
action. Subsequently we have been 
asked to pay a penalty of `10 Crore and 
have also been instructed to repay the 
commission that we earned from this 
process back to customers. We accept 
this verdict and will comply with the 
directives. 

Importance of Culture 

These incidents have made us realise 
that we need to reiterate what culture 
is. Business objectives should be driven 
keeping in mind the three Cs: Culture, 
Conscience and Customers. Customers 
are at the heart of everything we do. 
But every individual has to ask himself: 
Am I doing the right thing for the 
customer? Am I doing the right thing for 

the organisation? Does my conscience 
permit this? As a Bank we have always 
taken pride in our integrity. However, 
the unscrupulous practices of a few 
people has made all of us resolve for 
far greater process controls to address 
this. I am personally determined to fix 
this. At an organisational level there is a 
greater focus on the role of Credit, Risk, 
Compliance, Audit and other enabling 
functions so that our checks and 
balances get strengthened. 

Customers are the reason we exist and 
our primary goal is to serve and delight 
them. We are proud of what we have 
achieved so far and still understand 
that we have a long way to go in 
improving our customer experience as 
consumer behaviours and expectations 
are changing every day. We realise 
that. As a Bank, we strongly believe 
we exist to enable our customers 
make better money choices, today 
and tomorrow. To pursue and realise 
this belief we are encouraging within 
the bank the principles of Simplicity, 
Knowledge and Empathy. Simplicity 
to make day-to-day transactions for 
our customers intuitive and rewarding, 
Knowledge to help customers realise 
their future dreams with the right choice 
of offerings from us and Empathy in 
the way we deal with our customers. 
We have put in place a systemic way of 
measuring our Customer Experience 
in the last year by adopting the Net 
Promoter System. We now have the 
ability to listen to our customers post 
transactions and journeys and we 
commit to use this feedback to solve 
their problems. We are committed to 
relook at the consumer journeys and 
redesign them to delight our customers 
including making investments in new-
age omni-channel customer experience 
technology and training our people 
to enable and empower our front end 
colleagues to serve our customers 
better. 

Reinforcing the three Cs: Culture, 
Conscience and Customers across the 
organisation is a clear focus area for 
both me and the Bank.

Strategy

Let me now come to our strategy. 
The hallmark of our strategy is that it 
has the ability to adapt, and evolve 
without losing the core. We are 
building upon our stated strategy of 
expanding our distribution footprint 
leveraging the Branch Channel and 
Virtual Relationship Channel with the 
addition of Digital Marketing as a key 
channel. This will enable us to capture 
the growth potential in both India 
and Bharat and different consumer 
segments like the tech-savvy and 
millennials going forward. While we 
continue to focus on the Corporate 
Cluster and Government Business to 
increase penetration, we have created a 
new business segment of Commercial 
(MSME) and Rural Banking to capture 
the next wave of growth. We will 
continue to strengthen our leadership 
position in the payments business 
and retail assets business and have 
added Wealth Management and Private 
Banking as a core focus area for us. 

All these core business areas would be 
supported by further strengthening our 
foundational capability in Technology 
and Digital domains. 

Our subsidiaries help us fulfil consumer 
needs for holistic financial solutions and 
we will continue to invest in them.

To realise this strategy we have unveiled 
Project Future Ready.

Project Future Ready

As a Bank we have grown for over a 
quarter of a century due to our ability 
to execute what we have laid out as per 
our plans. Project Future Ready aims to 
continue the same tradition by calling 
out clear areas of focus to further add 
strength to our strategic and execution 
muscle. 

1   We have clearly identified our 
growth engines: Corporate Banking, 
Commercial Banking (MSME) and 
Rural, Government and Institutional 
Banking, Private Banking, Retail Assets 
and Payments to be driven by our 
delivery channels of Branch Banking, 
Tele-Sales/Service/Relationship and 
Digital Marketing. These growth engines 
would be powered by our robust 
technology and digital platforms. These 
growth engines will account for the bulk 
of our future investments and can be 
broadly classified as Business Verticals 
and Delivery Channels.

2   Our growth engines will be fully 

supported by our renewed focus 
and vigour on Technology/Digital 
investments that would act as the core 
backbone to both Run and Build the 
Bank. As mentioned earlier, while we 
strengthen our Enterprise Technology 
Factory to keep our systems  
always ‘ON’, available and secure, we 
are creating a new Digital Factory. The 
mandate of the new Digital Factory is 
to foster innovations in the Product and 
Consumer experience domain through 
own build / collaborate with new age 
fin-tech and big-tech companies. 
Hollowing the core, moving to the 
cloud, creation of micro-services / 
API based architecture, innovating 
through partnerships leveraging API 
interconnectivity all backed by a strong 
Data / AI strategy would form the core 
of what we intend to pursue going 
forward. We are working on many new 
exciting opportunities to improve our 
consumer experience and introduce 

new innovations like ‘Banking on the 
Edge’, which would be announced in 
due course of time.

3   We have also put in place the 

right talent to drive Project Future 
Ready. The underlying philosophy is to 
develop employees with diverse skills, 
multifunctional exposure with a One 
Bank collaborative mindset to deliver on 
Project Future Ready and enable more 
opportunities for career growth. 

4   We will continue to strengthen 
our core enabling functions of Internal 
Audit, Credit and Underwriting, 
Risk Management and Compliance/
Governance to support the growth 
ambitions. 

I firmly believe Project Future Ready will 
catalyse, create and capture the next 
wave of growth. 

Environment, Social and 
Governance Strategy

The year gone by has brought home 
to all of us how interconnected our 
destinies are. Our ESG strategy is 
based on this interconnectedness, 
especially in the Environment and 
Social spheres. Climate change is 
possibly the biggest threat to humanity 
after the pandemic. Global warming has 
huge potential to disrupt both lives and 
livelihood. Over the years we have been 
taking small but sure steps to mitigate 
the impact of global warming. 

Recently, we have committed ourselves 
to becoming carbon neutral by the  
FY32. As a part of this initiative, 
the Bank is looking at reducing 
its emissions, energy and water 
consumption. The Bank will continue 
to incorporate and scale up the use of 
renewable energy in its operations.  
As a part of the roadmap, we will focus 
on offering loans for green products 
like electric vehicles at lower interest 
rates and incorporate ESG scores while 

making credit decisions. The Bank is 
also working on a framework for issuing 
green bonds. All this while we continue 
to transform lives through our CSR 
initiatives under Parivartan through 
which we have already impacted over  
8.5 Crore lives. 

Compassion 

I would like to end by once again 
thanking all my colleagues and their 
families for their tremendous efforts this 
year in spite of trying circumstances. 

Finally, my heartfelt gratitude to our 
customers who continue to repose 
their faith in us and keep pushing us to 
strive for more. To all of them, I would 
like to say this: There might have been 
instances where we may not have kept 
our timelines in serving you, as we used 
to, due to the pandemic situation we 
have found ourselves in. Our sincere 
apologies and many thanks for your 
understanding and consideration.  
I want to reiterate that we are 
committed to delight you with renewed 
vigour as we move forward.

One last word. As we grapple with 
many pandemic induced uncertainties, 
it is important to not lose the human 
touch while dealing with people in our 
day to day lives. It is the true wealth that 
we can bequeath to the world. While 
business and professional goals have 
their place, nothing really comes before 
human life. Take care of your health and 
stay safe.

Financial Performance 

Financial Capital

All-round performance

The Bank has maintained its leadership position and delivered consistent growth 
across a majority of its key financial parameters. Despite being a pandemic-disrupted 
year, it has held its own with a strong customer base, robust risk management 
framework and best governance practices. All of this underlines its commitment to 
‘Responsible Business’.

The percentage increase in performance indicators was subdued as compared to a pre-COVID-19 year; even so, the year-
on-year increase in key metrics shows a healthy and continued growth. The Bank’s growth metrics like its Balance sheet 
size which crossed `17 Lakh Crore – a 14.1% increase, was driven by similar increase in Advances (14.0%) and Deposits 
(16.3%). Our efficiency in managing capital can be seen from a 27.0% increase in our low-cost CASA deposits – the 
highest in previous three years. Our profitability in disruptive times, is an outcome of the operational efficiencies built into 
our system. We continue to deliver a double-digit growth in earnings, with an increase of 18.5% in net profit, while keeping 
a check on our operational costs, resulting in a lower cost to income ratio of 36.3%. The Bank’s business resilience is an 
important indicator of our credit risk evaluation and management. Our key strength continues to be maintaining one of the 
lowest levels of Gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in the Banking industry with provision coverage ratio of 69.8%.

HDFC Bank Limited | Integrated Annual Report 2020-21Statutory Reports and  Financial StatementsOverviewIntroduction to HDFC BankOur PerformanceHow We  Create ValueOur StrategyResponsible BusinessDriving aspirations
of inclusive 
growth

Semi-urban and rural 
markets (SURU) have been 
a core element of our 
strategy since inception. 
This assumed special 
significance in FY21. With the 
relative insulation of the rural 
economy from the pandemic, 
sectors dependent on the 
hinterland have performed 
relatively better.

The trend of rising income levels in 
these markets continued even while the 
economy was affected by COVID-19. 
Today, we are well positioned to address 
the growing demand for better quality 
financial products and solutions.

Another key aspect of our strategy in 
these markets has been the near trebling 
of the Business Correspondent network 
to 15,756 from 5,541 in the previous year. 
We have adopted a segment-specific 
approach like funding to agribusiness, 
MSMEs and dairy farmers.

We are focusing on SURU markets not 
just to expand our loan book, but also 
to empower our customers. One such 
initiative has been the Kisan Dhan Vikas 
Kendras. At these centres, farmers 
access information on soil health, mandi 
prices, and various government initiatives 
and receive expert advice. During the 
pandemic period, we have piloted digital 
outreach programmes. These services 
are also available on the Bank’s website in 
vernacular languages.

The focus on SURU validates our ability to 
identify opportunities early and address 
them by providing a wide range of 
products and solutions that are aligned 
with the customers’ evolving needs.

Bapupura is a small village located in the 
Gandhinagar district of Gujarat. Out of the 
2,500 odd people that call this village their 
home, many depend on dairy farming for their 
livelihood. India is the largest producer of milk 
in the world, yet, our farmers lack access to 
markets, finance and much needed know how 
to improve yields in the face of climate change.

HDFC Bank, has installed Milk-To-Money 
terminals in Bapupura, to help create a viable 
support ecosystem for small and marginal 
dairy farmers, automating the entire process 
of payments. The Milk-To-Money terminals 
act as multifunctional terminals that provide 
a transparent mechanism for the farmer to be 
paid exactly as per quality of milk delivered, 
thus eliminating any errors or discrepancies. 
The farmer accounts are electronically credited 
and they can withdraw the money from cash 
dispensers immediately, if needed. There 
are two objectives behind the initiative. One 
is promoting financial literacy and inclusion 
in deeper geographies where India resides. 
The other is promoting digital transactions for 
financial services in rural India. The project 
benefits the entire community in the locality 
irrespective of their demographic profile.

This initiative has helped the farmers inculcate 
the saving habit and ultimately helped enhance 
their status.

Identifying issues  
that impact value creation

We identify key topics that have a 
material impact on our ability to create 
value through a materiality assessment 
exercise, which is aligned with GRI 
requirements and is conducted in 
consultation with internal and external 
stakeholders. The topics identified as 
‘material’ to us reflect the challenges, 
risks and opportunities we might face. 

The last such exercise was undertaken 
in FY19, which enabled us to 
incorporate insights from relevant 
stakeholder groups into our decision-
making process. In FY21, we updated 
our materiality analysis to better reflect 
emerging ESG issues such as climate 
change risks.

General disclosure - Reporting practice

With the growing demand for ESG disclosures among the stakeholders, we ensure that such reporting is 
accurate and reliable. At HDFC Bank, we have put in place a sustainability reporting programme aimed at 
articulating our sustainability strategy, risks, and opportunities and performance on material ESG topics, 
aligned with internal and external stakeholder expectations.
We also accord due importance to report assurance process. Our Integrated Report and our Green House 
Gas (GHG) emissions are externally verified by third-party auditors based on the International Standard on 
Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised).

We have a diverse lending portfolio cutting across all sectors including power, heavy industries and real

been  initiated  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD). We also continue our endeavour to acquire granular data and test tools for climate risk 
assessment and conducting scenario analysis.

General disclosure - Governance

We have a multi-layered risk management process to identify, assess, monitor and manage risks through the 
effective use of processes, information and technology. As part of our overall risk management framework, 
we have a Board-approved Stress Testing Policy & Framework which forms an integral part of our ICAAP 
(Internal  Capital  Adequacy  Assessment  Process).  Stress  testing  involves  the  use  of  various  techniques 
to  assess  our  vulnerability  to  extreme  but  plausible  adverse  business  conditions.  Further,  we  have  a 
SEMS (Social & Environmental Management System) framework for assessing social and environmental 
credit  risks  in  our  portfolio.  Risk  exposures  are  actively  captured  and  reported  to  the  relevant  levels  of 
management, to initiate appropriate mitigation measures. The risk management function is independent 
from business, and reports directly to the Managing Director & CEO.

To move towards a low-carbon economy, we aim to adopt cleaner sources of energy. We also invest in 
renewable  energy,  manage  and  report  our  carbon  footprint,  and  engage  with  the  community  to  adopt 
environment-friendly practices. We have also set targets to reduce our GHG emissions. Further, in line with 
the Paris Agreement on climate change, we are in the process of committing to science-based emissions 
targets.

Economic performance; Local communities

Financial inclusion is crucial for India’s sustained economic growth. As the nation’s largest private bank, we 
are cognisant of our responsibility to brining the under-banked population of the country to the economic 
mainstream. This in turn provides an opportunity to reach out to a wider customer base.

Finance

Environmental compliance; Socioeconomic compliance

We recognise the inherent social and environmental/climate change risks in our loan portfolio. Thus, as 
a  part  of  our  credit  policy,  we  evaluate  all  loans,  whether  for  greenfield  projects  or  for  regular  capital 
expenditure,  with  a  value  of  more  than  `10  Crore  and  a  tenor  of  over  5  years,  through  our  Social  and 
Environmental  Management  System  (SEMS)  framework.  We  do  not  fund  projects  that  have  potential 
adverse impact on Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) levels. Further, we continue to invest in renewable 
energy and energy efficiency projects to lower our carbon footprint. We also encourage customers to make 
‘green banking’ choices.

the next wave 
of transformation

Over a quarter of a century,  
we have built a formidable banking 
franchise by spotting opportunities 
early and then capitalising 
on them in relevant markets 
and through the right channels. 
Steered by a new leadership, we 
recently launched Project Future 
Ready to catalyse, create and 
capture the next wave of growth.

Broadly classified under Business 
Verticals, Delivery Channels and 
Technology/Digital, these engines will be 
driven by a workforce with diverse skills, 
and multifunctional exposure with a  
One Bank collaborative mindset. This will 
be backed by our traditional strengths 
in Internal Audit, Underwriting, Risk 
Management and Governance. Further, 
we have already outlined our technology 
transformation agenda to synergise and 
integrate our technology/digital functions 
and will invest aggressively to both Run 
and Build the Bank of the future.

Our Future Ready  
Strategy 

As a Bank, we assess disruptions and real-time challenges for insights to adapt our 
strategies and focus areas. We continue to keep our stakeholders at the centre of our 
strategy with ESG as an overarching principle. Our strategic priorities as envisaged in 
the previous years has held us in good stead through the pandemic. However, this was a 
year of improvising, finding solutions and being pragmatic, in an unpredictable domestic 
and global environment.

To improve focus on what the Bank perceives as growth engines, we have fine-tuned our strategic priorities by making them 
more granular. Our strategy can be visualised as ten pillars supported by certain enablers. These are foundational to the Bank 
and hence critical for achieving our strategic goals.

about doing our business.

40

Our risk management and compliance 
framework is embedded in the systems 
and processes across operations and 
functions and complemented by a risk 
conscious culture led by the Board.

Aided with tools and technology, 
we would focus in ensuring a 
seamless process of onboarding 
customers, offering products and 
services, underwriting processes and 

customer engagements with minimum 
intervention, i.e., zero paper, zero touch!

The Bank encourages organisational 
culture of mentorship, transparency, 
communication, empowerment and 
supporting. 

Our ‘nurture and care’ attitude towards 
our people is fundamental to the Bank’s 
twin strategic objectives of leadership 
and development.

Strategic pillars

Re-Imagining the branch channel 

Our branches represent the Bank to 
its customers, the society and other 
stakeholders and own retail and 
business customer relationships. Retail 
branch banking is the key driver for 
retail deposits franchise, retail trade 
and forex business, unsecured and 
secured asset business and third-party 
distribution business. At the same time 
it’s also a congregation place for its 
sales force to get together, brainstorm 
and formulate its one bank approach for 
‘Go to market’.

Our strategy is to re-imagine this 
channel by bringing more science to  
the art of relationship management.  
The primary objective of this strategy 
is to acquire new customers, gather 
a larger share of the wallet of existing 
customers and deliver a best in class 
experience, thus building customer 
loyalty. 

The Bank intends to transform 
its branches into ‘phygital’ 
financial marketplaces through - 
catchment scoping and mining with 
institutionalised consistency and 
customer need centric conversations 
enabled through artificial intelligence 
led predictive analytics. Retail Branch 
Banking has evolved in a significant 
manner over a period of time and while 
the transformation journey continues, 
the ethos remains the same –  
‘Focus on customer’. The key strategic  
drivers are:

1   Holistic customer life cycle 
management: Centred around holistic 
Customer Lifecycle Management and 
our ability to read customer insights/
needs and provide the right product 
proposition. It also, inter alia, entails the 
ability to map and source the right set 
of customers using a differentiated go 
to market approach.

2   Analytics led customer 
conversation and distribution 
planning tool: An approach which

How we are re-imagining branch channel 

Access to high end AI
Adoption of ‘Next Best Action’ – an 
Al-powered analytical tool helping 
‘predict’ customer requirements

Omnichannel Experience
All of the Bank’s products available at 
every customer touch point

encapsulates the tenet of ‘Need 
Based Selling’. Using cutting edge 
AI, conversations with the customer 
are more meaningful. The decision 
matrix with respect to distribution 
expansion has now been embedded 
with structured and unstructured 
sources of data to help the business 
team take data driven decisions on key 
issues like opening branches, or serving 
customers through a ‘Smart Banking 
Lobby’ or, Business correspondents 

3   Digitisation of Sales, Service 
and Branch Operations: Significant 
headway in digital journeys in all 
customer touch points like sales, 
service and operations. Mobile-first 
approach leveraging Aadhar, and ‘walk 
out working’ straight through journeys 
are some of the concepts that are 
helping us achieve significant benefits in 
terms of improved customer experience 
and cost reduction

4   Customer Experience  
Excellence: The cornerstone of 
Customer Experience is to delight 
customers at every touch point. In 
this endeavour, key strategies include 
process simplification and digitisation 

thus reimagining the journeys and 
making them simple and user friendly. 
Also, enable self-service wherever 
possible so that there is complete 
empowerment of customers in 
completing paperless journeys on their 
own. Net Promoter Score as a metric 
of measuring customer satisfaction and 
loyalty has been introduced to build a 
‘Customer First’ culture. 

5   People Capability: Building 
a ‘Future Fit’ team that understands 
‘voice of customer’ and has the ability 
to funnel that understanding to create 
newer propositions, simpler processes 
and engaging customer experiences. 
Empowering teams to digitally access 
interactive learning interventions that 
equip them to build customer delight. 

Virtual Relationship 
Management 

Digital is transforming the marketplace. 
The Bank believed early that traditional 
relationship management is making 
way for technology and virtual 
engagement with customers. Over the 
last few years, the Bank has invested 

41

HDFC Bank Limited | Integrated Annual Report 2020-21Statutory Reports and  Financial StatementsOverviewIntroduction to HDFC BankOur PerformanceHow We  Create ValueOur StrategyResponsible BusinessStrategy in Action

in its virtual relationship management 
channel to further advance its customer 
engagement and enhance its service 
experience. In the last year, digital 
or contactless banking has become 
more of a necessity than a service 
enhancement. As digital literacy and 
exposure increases exponentially, VRM 
is gaining acceptance through wider 
engagement, deeper relationships and 
a complete suite of products to offer. 
A banking experience with digital ease 
and personalised conversations is the 
core of our VRM strategy. 

The Virtual Relationship Management 
practice is an integrated customer 
centric approach covering three pillars.

•  Virtual Relationship

•  Virtual Sales

•  Virtual Care

a) Seamless 24/7 access to 

customers with global service 
standards

b) Automated Interactive Voice 
Response solution in 12 
languages with over 20 services

We as a Bank believe we are best 
placed and have a head start with 
our Virtual Relationship Management 
practice leveraging four key 
components: 
a)  Omni Channel Engagement 

framework

b)  Seamless digital journeys
c)  Data Science led customer 

interaction

d)  Robust talent pool of well-trained 
Virtual Relationship Managers

The model is built on a foundation 
of Customer Obsession to Nurture, 
Care and Collaborate. The Virtual 
Relationship Managers offer world class 
service interaction with an analytics 
led need based product distribution 
approach aimed to make us the Primary 
banker of choice to the customer. The 
Virtual Relationship Managers serves 
the customer lifecycle under five pillars 
– a) Save b) Invest c) Borrow d) Transact 
e) Engage. This cohesive strategy 
allows to deepen the relationship and 
proactively offer the right product 
program to the customers.

42

The Bank is making significant 
investments in technology upgradation 
of the customer facing solutions 
around Interactive Voice Response 
Systems, Data Management and digital 
engagement platforms like Video KYC 
to offer world class virtual engagement 
framework for its customers.

Semi-Urban & Rural 
(SURU) and Government 
& Institutional (GI) 

The last few years have been a 
renaissance of sorts in the Rural 
Ecosystem with the advent, adaptability 
and usage of technology in the 
hinterlands. There has been a steady 
rise in mobile penetration in the Rural 
areas and the access of data has 
opened up the world of aspiration 
building, increasing demand and 
thereafter fulfilment. With more than half 
of our banking outlets and a third of our 
workforce (including Agri/ SLI and RIG) 
in this market, we are well poised to 
excavate and maximise this opportunity 
by creating phygital processes for 
business and market share increment 
as well our Bank’s penetration. Our 
Bank’s tie up with CSC – a special 
purpose vehicle (SPV) set up by 
Ministry of Electronics and Information 
Technology (MEITY) to offer Citizen 
Facilitation Services digitally has been 
a catalyst in increasing the distribution 
footprint in the semi-urban and rural 
geography without incurring cost on 
setting up a brick & mortar model. Till 
date we have on-boarded more than 
1 Lakh VLE’s as Business Facilitators 
and Business Correspondents to 
help source business for us. With 
the help of the VLEs, we intend to 
create a large distribution network 
to capture the opportunities in the 
semi-urban and rural areas as well as 
geographically increase our reach in 
deep geographies.

The lifting of the embargo on 
Government business for private sector 
banks, the Digital India Mission, and 
the recent circular on the Single Nodal 
Agency account by Government of India 
are strong tailwinds for this business. 
The growing emphasis at each level 

of Government to use technology to 
bring in transparency and efficiency 
offers significant promise. Given our 
large distribution network including 
in rural areas, technological prowess, 
partnerships with key digital platform 
and solution providers, competitive 
product offerings, and a focus on 
granular business we are well-poised 
to further our market share. On the 
institutional front, the opportunity is 
humongous in the following segments 
– education, healthcare, housing 
societies, NGOs, trusts given the 
multiple types of trusts, e.g. charitable, 
family, gratuity, etc. Each segment 
is a vertical in itself. We are adopting 
an ecosystem based approach to 
unlock the opportunity offered by each 
segment. This entails systematically 
targeting the constituents of each 
segment and putting in place the 
relevant products, partnerships, digital 
journeys, solutions, and offers for the 
constituents of each segment.  

Leadership in  
Payments Business 

We are the leading player in the 
payments ecosystem with dominant 
share in both card issuing and acquiring 
business

We have the most extensive suite of 
payment form factors to offer to our 
customers be it Cards, POS terminals, 
payment gateways, UPI, QR etc. With 
over 51 Million credit cards, debit cards 
and prepaid cards addressing every 
market segment, every third rupee 
spent on cards in India happens on 
HDFC Bank cards. We are a leading 
player in credit cards with a strong 
growth and market share on both 
booksize/ENR and spends. We have 
built several strong digital offerings 
like PayZapp and plan to fortify the 
product offering in the coming year to 
provide strong engagement platform 
for HDFC Bank customers. We will be 
providing strong unified experience 
across contactless payments, QR 
based payments, UPI payments, 
BNPL and digitalising all payment form 
factors with rich features in a unified 
platform. Smartbuy is growing as a 

strong offer platform which aggregates 
strong offers from merchants and 
partners, providing a one-view to the 
customer on all benefits which he/
she can avail exclusively as a HDFC 
Bank customer. We have provided a 
strong loyalty framework and gained 
popularity among customers for getting 
accelerated reward points and rewards 
redemptions in a single platform. 

To complete our suite of products and 
payment suite to the retail consumers, 
we are scaling BNPL with multiple 
variants that we are building to make 
customer purchases convenient. 
Between Credit card EMI, Debit card 
EMI, paper financing we are riding the 
wave of innovation and have become 
No.1 among all banks in BNPL. We 
plan to launch several new variants, 
customised solutions with large brands/
partners in the coming year. 

We have extremely strong plans to also 
grow two new segments apart from 
retail consumers. Commercial and SME 
payment solutions is a fast growing 
space and we have made strong 
carding and payment solution inroads 
into this segment. We have several 
curated solutions being rolled out for 
Corporate & SME segment and we will 
grow this segment by 2X in the coming 
2 years. 

Merchant Acquiring business provides 
the rail road for banking solutions 
and Payment offerings to the largest 
customer segment – MSMEs. As 
a Bank we have been leading this 
business for 15+ years and despite the 
disruptive competition in this space, we 
have continued to grow and currently 
have over 47% market share. Our 
focus is to grow our current 2 Million 
acceptance points network by 10X in 
3-5 years.

Over the years our strategy has 
evolved in-line with the competitive 
landscape and market opportunities, 
From focusing only on large and key 
merchants in the top 30 cities to 
expanding the industry by investing 
in digitising institutional segments like 
education, government and societies 

and taking the product range to 
deeper geographies to now focusing 
also on the small merchants and 
neighbourhood kirana stores and 
building partnerships, our strategy 
has continued to evolve. In recent 
times with large fintechs and MNCs 
entering this space, our strategy 
has been further strengthened with 
two new pillars of ‘Partnerships’ and 
‘Service and Experience’. The success 
of this is reflected in our consistently 
growing market share and merchant 
engagement metrics. 

To support this strategy we recently 
launched SmartHub 3.0 – a 
comprehensive banking and payment 
solution range for all merchants. This 
range of solutions allows merchants 
and self employed professionals to 
instantly open a mini savings account 
or current account and start accepting 
payments in-store, online and on-
the-go. The solution range is tailor 
made for the size and segment of the 
merchant and consists of a vast range 
of offerings starting from rent free 
SmartHub merchant app and QR to 
personalised payment link option to 
a vast bouquet of POS devices. This 
platform is further being expanded into 
a super app ecosystem with integrated 
servicing, integrated cash-flow based 
lending, small ticket size flexible 
repayment loans, business cards and 
suite of value added services, offered 
in partnership with fintechs. While the 
platform and ecosystem will ensure 
engagement and scale, with reducing 
transaction margins and need for 
higher investments, the business focus 
to generate revenue will be through a 
‘sandwich strategy’. Under this strategy 
the payments layer in the middle will 
be ring-fenced with a layer of liability 
offerings on one side and asset offering 
on the other. These offerings will be 
for both the merchants and also the 
customers of the merchant, integrated 
seamlessly in the SmartHub platform. 
This will help merchants improve their 
cash-flow as Bank will enable funding 
& affordability at transaction level on all 
its acceptance points. This has multi-
level benefits to both the bank and the 

merchants - Bank gets distribution point 
expansion and Merchants get cashflow 
benefit and also incentives from the 
Bank, thus creating a synergistic 
sustainable strategy for the Business.

Technology/Digital 

Our vision is to build a technology led 
bank. We are doing this by leveraging 
our strengths and building for the 
future. Some key aspects are:
•  Continue to focus on scale to 

manage one of the largest franchises 
in the world; creating infrastructure, 
partnerships and competencies for 
scale is a priority

•  Fortifying our infrastructure and 

building for resiliency

•  Focus of customer experience – 

make banking easy for young and 
old, urban and rural. Offering  
best-in-class experience for our 
existing and potential customers
•  Bring in operational efficiencies – 

build a highly productive workforce

•  Build a safe, transparent and a 

regulatorily compliant technology led 
bank that citizens can trust 

Our approach is two pronged - ‘Run the 
Bank’ and ‘Build the Bank of the future’. 
Making banking easy, contextual and 
safe for our customers is our priority. 
We have been digitising our customer 
journeys across the bank enabling easy 
onboarding, transactions and customer 
lifecycle management. In parallel we 
are also building new capabilities and 
competencies to build the bank of the 
future. 

As we realise the above objectives 
through multiple initiatives, we are also 
building one of the finest digital and 
technology capabilities in the financial 
services industry. We are not only 
fortifying our enterprise IT but also 
building new muscle through our newly 
created Digital Factory and Enterprise 
Factory. The new factories are bringing 
in new skills, new technologies and new 
ways of working. 

We have begun architecting our 
banking technology stack for the future:

2   Creating secure APIs and

3   Re-imagining intuitive and

4   Leveraging data analytics. 

We can already see some impact.  
Our transactions on mobile and 
net banking are increasing. As our 
onboarding journeys become simpler 
and intuitive through the use of new 
engagement platforms, we see a 
higher preference and adoption for 
digital. We are also leveraging data 
analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
Machine Learning (ML) for powering 
personalisation, credit underwriting and 
risk control. 

Our underlying core technology 
infrastructure is being further fortified 
to make it resilient and scalable to 
handle the ever increasing load of digital 
transactions. Our proactive monitoring 
of service paths and DevSecOps 
framework would ensure that we have 
a continuously integrated build and 
deployment pipeline to ensure agility, 
quality and security.

Commercial and Rural 

One of the important pillars of the 
Bank’s strategy is commercial and 
rural strategy which encompasses – 
micro, small and medium enterprises 
(MSME/SME), emerging corporates, 
the mid-market companies, commercial 
agriculture and commercial transport 
companies. This is the Bank’s fastest 
growing market group that contributes 
significantly to India’s manufacturing 
output, export, employment, supply 
chain network and infrastructure. 
Constraints faced by the group include 
lack of easy or timely access to credit, 
high cost of credit and collateral 
deficiency. These issues, viewed with 
the growth potential of the commercial 
and rural sector, is an opportunity like 

44

no other. The Bank aims to augment 
as well as facilitate the growth of 
individual ecosystems that exist within 
the group, (such as the rural ecosystem 
or the supply chain network), with 
products and services tailored to 
add-value and financial strength. 
Focusing on the commercial and rural 
group also supports the Bank’s goal 
of deep geographical penetration and 
expansion. Using customised product 
offering, digital expertise and deeper 
geographical presence, the Bank 
is contributing to bridging the gap 
between India and Bharat. 

Retail Assets

The Bank continues its leadership 
position in Consumer/Retail assets in 
various key and diversified product 
offerings like auto loans, personal 
loans and home loans among others. 
The strengths built in these products 
by serving the large metro and urban 
customer base can be adapted to serve 
the needs of the large population in 
the Indian hinterland where consumer 
aspirations are increasing. Their 
banking needs have to be assessed 
and addressed differently from the 
urban retail banking customers. We 
have carved Retail Assets as a separate 
strategic pillar to ensure higher focus 
on this segment especially in deeper 
geographies where the growth drivers 
come from using digital advancement 
and increased geographical presence. 
We will continue to focus on salaried 
segments within top rated corporates 
and government institutions across 
geographies and we believe that 
increasing aspirations will provide us 
a greater opportunity to cross sell our 
diversified retail products. The Indian 
market is likely to grow at a better rate 
in the coming five years vs the last five. 
This data is basis the emerging markets 
trends world over and with unorganised 
sector becoming more organised 
with bureau support the organised 

consumer financial sector will increase 
at a faster rate. HDFC Bank, with a 
strong distribution in both open market 
and internal customer franchise with 
digital strengths is in the right position 
to leverage and grow across touch 
points and pincodes. 

Corporate Cluster

The Bank’s corporate banking vertical 
offers comprehensive banking solutions 
to corporates across industries and 
sectors. This includes but is not limited 
to, large business houses, MNCs, 
companies in the manufacturing 
and service sectors, public sector 
enterprises, financial institutions, 
Global Capability Centres (GCC) etc. 
The focus of the corporate cluster 
is to deepen corporate relationships 
with more attention being paid to 
their requirements on the funding 
side, with regards to their collections 
and payments, their trade related 
requirements or even the financial 
well-being of their employees and key 
officials. 

The strategy around our ‘corporate 
cluster’ has been focused on 
serving the entire ecosystem of 
large corporates. Using ground level 
intelligence about our customers’ 
processes, distribution networks, 
geographies etc. the Bank provides 
value-adds and solutions for financial 
concerns that are unique to industries 
in this cluster. The Bank already has 
host to host connectivity with the 
large corporates using APIs and is 
working towards digitising end-to-
end transaction processing within 
their ecosystems. The quality service 
offering that is provided to our 
corporate customers can be extended 
to customers and suppliers of the 
corporate using ‘ecosystem banking’ 
with a view to bring the client’s entire 
financial world under one umbrella. 
The Bank’s value proposition is two-
fold; 1. To digitise the purchase and 
ownership journeys of the company’s 
customers and 2. To enable all sourcing 
to be digitally tracked and to use 
trade finance products to enable a 

better relationship with its supplier. 
This initiative uses digital platforms, 
interfaces, data analytics, and our 
wealth of relationships to provide 
the corporate and its entire gamut of 
customers and trade partners, quick 
and easy access to financial solutions 
with an aim to increase product 
penetration at each corporate.

Diversification of the corporate portfolio 
is also a key driver of the growth of the 
corporate cluster.

Wealth

A large proportion of wealth in India 
lies distributed even beyond the 
top 20 cities of the country. The 
Bank’s strategy is to cover a larger 
geographical spread, to provide 
differentiated wealth management 
solutions using digital tools. The Bank 
is creating new product offerings and 
improving its existing solutions to reach 
out to this population using technology. 
With focus on ‘wealth’ as a strategic 
priority, the Bank aims to increase its 
wealth management customer base 
significantly, in the next few years.

Digital Marketing

Our digital marketing strategy is to 
leverage it as an independent channel 
for end-to-end business generation.  
It rests on three key pillars.

1   Create Brand awareness and 

consideration: Leverage digital 
marketing to drive awareness about 
our financial solutions, create customer 
brand love, so they will consider us 
favorably while making their purchase 
decisions.

2   Deliver Portfolio Objectives: Use 

our Omni Channel forte consisting 
of website, net and mobile banking, 
notifications, SMS, Email, WhatsApp 
and social media to deliver the business 
portfolio objectives. Develop segmented 
and personalised communication based 
on highly advanced AI/ML models.

3   Contribute to direct business 
generation: Digital marketing relies 
on advanced analytics to identify and 
target the right customer with the right 
product, at the right time, in their most 
preferred channel of communication 
and with high levels of personalisation. 
Investments in advanced analytics 
tools on cloud have ensured we have 
a deep understanding of customer 
behaviour, and their preferences to 
curate personalised interventions, at 
scale and to create relevant customer 
engagement.

Investments in latest Martech solutions 
have been done to create frictionless 
digital journeys that allow customers to 
buy our financial products and services 
with zero or minimal physical interface.

We are closely linking customer 
understanding using technology to 

drive digitisation across the bank. We 
have honed the ability to execute digital 
marketing plans at scale and in tandem 
with the traditional marketing channels 
so as to provide our customers quick 
and easy access to all our financial 
solutions.

We have created frictionless digital 
journeys for loans, deposits and 
payment solutions which allow our 
customers experience making a 
purchase in a few clicks. This also helps 
us take our financial solutions to the 
under-penetrated semi-urban and rural 
segments.

Our Pay, Save, Borrow, Invest solutions 
will be part of these digital journeys, so 
that new and existing customers across 
segments can get instant approvals and 
purchase them without stepping out of 
their homes.

Subsidiaries
Through its subsidiaries HDFC Securities Limited (HSL) and HDB Financial 
Services Limited (HDB), the Bank offers a depth of customer relationship with 
the complete breadth of products. The subsidiaries are important pillars of 
the Bank’s strategy to tap into opportunities beyond banking services

HDB is a non-deposit taking non-
banking finance company (NBFC) 
that has positioned itself as a one-
stop financial services provider, with 
a complete suite of customised loan 
and other service offerings through 
a network of over 1,319 branches 
across 959 cities/towns. It’s range of 
services and products include loans-
consumer and enterprise loans, 
asset finance, micro-loans, fee-
based services and BPO services.

active customers accessed its 
services digitally. HSL’s distribution 
network extends across 216 
branches in 159 cities, serving a 
diverse set of retail and institutional

Responding to market challenges 

COVID-19 delivered a global economic shock, leading to a much wider 
macroeconomic impact than the global financial crisis of 2007-08. 

The pandemic disrupted the real 
economy, and not just the financial 
system alone. After a contraction of 
3.3% in 2020, the global economy is 
projected to grow at 6.0% in 2021, 
aided by monetary and fiscal support 
extended by Governments and Central 
Banks, and the vaccination rollout. 
However, the shape of the recovery is 
likely to vary across regions based on 
the path of the pandemic, the severity 

Projected global economic growth  
in 2021
6%

of restrictions imposed to contain the 
spread, and the magnitude of policy 
actions. 

In the US, the fiscal package of $1.9 
trillion is expected to bolster US 
economic growth and have a positive 
spill over effect on its trading partners. 
Among advanced economies, the 
US is expected to surpass its pre-
COVID GDP level in 2021 and the UK’s 
economy is expected to reach its pre-
pandemic size in Q4 2021, while many 
others in the group are likely to return 
to pre-pandemic levels only in 2022. 
Similarly, among emerging economies, 

China has already returned to its pre-
COVID GDP in 2020 and India is likely 
to return to its pre-pandemic level of 
output in FY22.

On the domestic front, the surge 
in daily COVID-19 cases is likely to 
impact a fragile recovery, with the 
relationship between lockdowns, 
reduced mobility and impact on growth 
being relatively strong. An increasing 
number of states were forced to go into 
a complete lockdown or strict localised 
containment for a longer period of time, 
resulting in high impact on  
economic activity.

Increasing government and regulatory interventions

The Government and Regulators stepped in during the year to alleviate the socio-economic 
effects of the pandemic and to stimulate growth. 

A

Two such measures were 
the moratorium and the loan 
restructuring packages introduced by 
the Reserve Bank of India. While the 
first allowed customers (from March 
to August 2020) to temporarily freeze 
loan repayments, the second eased 
the burden of monthly repayments.

Our response

Loan moratorium – The relief provided 
to our customers include

•  A standstill on delinquency position 

as of February 2020 

•  Relief from making loan repayments 
during between March 2020 and 
May 2020 (Moratorium 1) and 
between June 2020 and August 
2020 (Moratorium 2)

We operationalised the moratorium 
process through a robust multichannel 
customer outreach programme 
designed to guide customers in a 
frictionless manner. Customers seeking 
moratorium were directed to our 
website to process their applications.

Loan restructuring – The loan 
restructuring programme was aimed 
at easing the burden of monthly 
repayments for eligible customers 
who were significantly affected by 
the pandemic. Customers seeking 
loan restructuring were allowed to 
reschedule their loan repayments and 
were offered lower payment structures, 
with extended tenors of up to 24 
months.

We also conducted an outreach 
programme to help customers 
understand the modalities of 
restructuring and guide them through 
the process. Our approach through 
the period was based on empathy, 
understanding and transparent 
communication as was evidenced by 
the scale and scope of relief provided to 
customers.

B
The Union Cabinet unveiled a 
stimulus package of `3 Trillion in 
May 2020 known as the Emergency 
Credit Line Guarantee Scheme 
(ECLGS) in aid of Micro, Small and 
Medium Enterprises, (MSMEs). 
This was aimed at addressing their 
working capital needs, operational 
liabilities and aiding businesses to 
restart. 

HDFC Bank disbursed `29,622 Crore 
to over 1.23 Lakh customers in FY21 
under the ECLGS scheme. We have 
also emerged as a star performer under 
the ECLGS 1.0 and 2.0 schemes.

Banking industry 
environment

The stress on the banking sector was 
further accentuated by the pandemic. 
Estimates suggest that 19 sectors that 
were previously not under stress before 
the pandemic have been hit, accounting 
for almost `15.5 Lakh Crore of debt. 
Retail and wholesale trade being the 
worst hit with an estimated outstanding 
of `5.4 Lakh Crore. The pandemic also 
affected 11 sectors that were already 
under stress. These sectors have a 
cumulative debt of `22.2 Lakh Crore.  
Of these, non-banking financial 
companies (NBFCs) accounted for the 
bulk of the debt at `7.98 Lakh Crore.

The exponential spread of COVID-19 
has led to the GDP growth contracting 
by 7.3% in FY21. The pandemic has 
a significant impact on economic 
activities and lending potential across 
sectors. Financial institutions using their 
strong liquidity position played a key 
role in reinvigorating the economy. 

Our response

We actively reached out to large 
corporates for their funding 
requirements, which we could do 
because of our strong balance sheet. 
Due to TLTRO scheme, we were 
able to raise funds at lower rates and 
further improve our liquidity position. 
We also actively participated 
in lending to the MSME sector. 
We continued our retail lending 
which capitalised on the revival in 
consumption in Q3 and Q4 to post 
a Y-o-Y growth of 6.7% in domestic 
retail loans. 

Growth in total advances (FY21)

Social distancing and restrictions

The banking sector is facilitated by the network it has, whether with branches or 
physical availability of Bank employees especially in rural India. New norms,  
state-wise variations in restrictions due to lockdowns and fear of infection after 
easing of restrictions later in the year have affected all businesses including that of 
financial institutions. 

Restriction on mobility has led to different ways of operating for employees and 
customers whether retail or wholesale. There is an increased preference for 
contactless banking and operating remotely.

We started with initiatives to promote 
Secure Banking during COVID-19.  
We conducted workshops to increase 
awareness on the rising cases of 
cyber frauds while making financial 
transactions and prevent them. Our 
Mooh Bandh Rakho campaign was 
aimed to help prevent cyber frauds 
and the spread of COVID-19 by means 
of wearing a mask and keeping one’s 
mouth shut (Mooh Bandh Rakho).  
In another initiative, we deployed  
49 mobile Automated Teller Machines 
(ATMs) across 47 cities to assist 
customers during the lockdown. 
One can conduct over 15 types of 
transactions using the Mobile ATM, 

which are operational at each location 
for a specific period. We also launched 
video KYC to ensure full KYC savings 
account activation and onboard new 
customers. To ensure the safety 
and wellbeing of our employees, we 
undertook various measures such 
as providing sanitisers and masks, 
disinfecting and fumigating all offices. 
We also set up COVID-19 
medical helpline and deployed a 
dedicated team for providing updates to 
the employees on time. For employees 
working from home, we provided 
the required IT support and put in 
place robust and secure systems and 
processes. 

Evolution of technology in 
trade and commerce

Demonetisation led to the faster adoption 
of digital payments post 2016. Coupled 
with restrictions in logistics and physical 
movement induced by COVID-19, there 
has been a spectacular surge in digital 
transactions. Further, large companies 
with a turnover of more than `50 Crore are 
mandated to offer prescribed electronic 
payment options from January 1, 2020. 
In a recent notification, the Central Board 
of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has 
made e-invoicing for GST, mandatory for 
taxpayers having turnover of over  
`50 Crore, from April 1, 2021.

Fintech adoption 

Climate change and ESG 

We have witnessed a high adoption of 
fintech solutions in the banking, financial 
services and insurance (BFSI) sector, 
which is mainly due to Government 
initiatives like demonetisation, GST, 
Digital India initiatives and growth in 
e-commerce. The pandemic restricted 
people to their homes, prompting 
fintech players to innovate and make 
their solutions more mobile-friendly.

As corporate governance issues surface 
with increasing frequency, banks and 
financial institutions, along with the 
regulators, are looking at risks through 
the ESG lens. Assessing the ESG health 
of the creditors is important to identify 
the inherent risks and take steps to 
mitigate them in order to preserve credit 
portfolio quality. Climate change is one 
of the key ESG risks, with a potential 
disruptive impact on the economy. It 
poses both physical and transition risks 
to our business, as the world transitions 
to a low-carbon economy. Thus, climate 
change is both a risk and a value creation 
opportunity.

Our response

We continued to invest in our 
intellectual capital, especially 
technology. We have planned for 
upgradations in the short-and-
medium term. We have attracted 
talent in areas such as data anlaytics 
and IT. Also, 178 external APIs are 
currently active on our API gateway. 
All of this enabled us to increase our 
customer base to 6.18 Crore, acquire 
more merchants, and expand our 
market share.

We have increased our investments 
in technology and in designing 
solutions that are more user friendly 
and seamless. Further, we are 
partnering with various fintech 
companies, as part of our strategy, 
to provide a differentiated customer 
experience. 

Our response to climate change and 
ESG issues is three-pronged. First, we 
manage and mitigate climate change 
and ESG risks through our internal 
initiatives. Second, we are developing 
a strategy to address climate change 
and ESG risks in our portfolio. Third, we 
support our communities in enhancing 
their resilience to climate change and 
environmental risks. We have set targets 
for tree plantation and to reduce our 
energy consumption and Green House 
Gas (GHG) emissions. We have initiated 
steps towards implementation of TCFD 
and SBTi recommendations and continue 
our endeavor to acquire granular data 
and test tools for developing climate risk 
assessment and scenario analysis. We 
also fund the development of renewable 
energy projects.

Future-proofing the business

Our risk management process is flexible and allows us to adopt best industry 
practices and adapt them to our business needs. We have adopted a multi-layered 
risk management process to identify, assess, monitor and manage both traditional 
as well as emerging risks through the effective use of processes, information 
and technology.

Risk Governance
The Board of Directors of the Bank 
takes responsibility for managing the 
comprehensive risks faced by the 
Bank. The Risk Policy & Monitoring 
Committee (RPMC) is a Board level 
committee, which supports the Board 
by supervising the implementation 
of the risk strategy. It guides the 
development of policies, procedures 
and systems for managing risk. It 
ensures that these are adequate and 

appropriate to changing business 
conditions, the structure and needs of 
the Bank and the risk appetite of the 
Bank. 

The Chief Risk Officer heads the 
independent Risk Management Group 
(RMG) which drives risk management 
centrally in the Bank. The RMG is 
primarily responsible for implementing 
the risk strategy approved by the 
Board, developing procedures & 

systems for identifying, measuring, 
monitoring, assessing and managing 
risk. The Chief Credit Officer heads the 
independent Credit Group overseeing 
the underwriting functions and 
approvals across retail and wholesale 
credit functions and ensuring that credit 
underwriting and portfolio management 
are aligned with the Board approved 
credit appetite.

The broad categories of risk we face 
are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, 
interest rate risk in the banking book 
and operational risk. Further, our focus 
on digitisation leads to cyber security 
and data risk as well as reputation risk. 
We are also exposed to Environmental, 
Social & Governance risks arising out of 
the nature of business operations of our 
borrowers (particularly large, corporate 
borrowers), the industry segment in 
which they operate and the deficits in 
their compliance to statutory/ regulatory 
norms.

Risk exposures are actively captured 
and reported to the relevant levels of 
management for initiation of appropriate 
risk mitigation measures. The Bank has 
a structured management framework 
for the identification and measurement 
of the various material risks that the 
Bank faces. We are also continuously 
evaluating the efficacy of existing risk 
model assumptions and parameters 
and refining the models to reflect the 
new business normal.

The Bank has policies, processes and 
sound methodologies for the effective 
control and management of individual 

risks. The Bank has put in place an 
overall Risk Appetite statement.  
In addition, appetites for individual risk 
types are operationalised through risk 
specific policies and limit packages. 
Stress tests form an integral part of risk 
analysis and computation of capital 
adequacy under severe but plausible 
scenarios that may adversely affect 
the Bank. While each of these risks is 
assessed, monitored and managed 
under individual policies for  
day-to-day functioning, the stress 
testing framework endeavours to assist 
in identification of potential loss.

Minimising operational 
losses through risk 
mitigation 

At a broader level, risks from climate 
change are typically divided into:

An ESG policy framework has been 
formulated to address this risk. 

Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG)

•  Physical risks  

Economic losses (physical damage 
to property and assets) from extreme 
weather events attributed to climate 
change 

•  Transition risks 

The possible process of adjustment 
to a low carbon economy and its 
possible effects on the value of 
financial assets and liabilities 

Further, we have a robust Social & 
Environmental Management System 
(SEMS) framework to address social 
and environmental/climate change risks 
in our loans. As a part of the ESG risk 
identification and mitigation process, 
we evaluate all our loans, irrespective 
of project type (greenfield projects 
or for regular capital expenditure), 
having a value of more than `10 Crore 
and a tenor of more than 5 years, for 
adherence to Environmental, Health, 
Social & Safety (EHSS) norms. We also 
track and externally verify our carbon 
emissions to effectively manage and 
reduce our footprint

We are exploring frameworks 
to model and assess 
climate risk. We also 
continue our endeavour to 
acquire granular data and 
test tools for climate risk 
assessment and conducting 
scenario analysis. On the 
Emissions front: we have 
taken targets to reduce our 
GHG emissions. Further, 
we are aligning with the 
Paris Agreement on 
climate change by initiating 
commitment towards 
Science-Based Targets

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank 
may not be able to meet its financial 
obligations as they fall due without 
incurring unacceptable losses

mechanism to comprehensively track 
cash flow mismatches under normal 
as well as stressed conditions and 
critical ratios including Basel III ratios 
has also been implemented. The Bank 
has an extensive intraday liquidity risk 
management framework for monitoring 
intraday positions during the day

•  To maintain healthy 

liquidity in comparison

Ensuring uninterrupted 
operations amid rapid change

We live in an increasingly unpredictable world. This has been compounded further by the 
challenge posed by the pandemic as complex operations across multiple stakeholders 
have to be managed remotely and digitally. At HDFC Bank, we have a  
well-defined Business Continuity Plan (BCP) in place to ensure the reliability and 
continuity of operations. 

Our BCP is based on regulatory guidelines, ISO 22301 certified, and is subject to regular reviews. We have a Business 
Continuity Policy and Procedure with clearly defined roles and responsibility.

Business continuity in 
pandemic times 

At HDFC Bank, we rose to the challenge 
of delivering uninterrupted banking 
services amid large-scale restrictions 
following the outbreak of the COVID-19 
pandemic. We adopted a multipronged 
strategy to prioritise the safety of our 
employees while ensuring service delivery 
to our customers. Following the gradual 
easing of the nationwide lockdown, we 
moved from crisis mode to business 
mode but continued implementing 
various continuity strategies, keeping in 
mind the evolving pandemic scenarios.

Relentless pursuit
of sustainability 

At HDFC Bank, we have always 
believed that business growth is 
intricately linked with prosperity 
of the communities we serve. 
We are leveraging our scale and 
reach to empower those sections 
of the society that remain less-
privileged through our five pillars 
of Rural Development, Promotion 
of Education, Skill Training and 
Livelihood Enhancement, Healthcare 
and Hygiene and Financial 
Literacy and Inclusion

Our Holistic Rural Development 
Programme (HRDP) was born 
out of the conviction that the 
nation progresses only when rural 
India grows. Our multi-pronged 
interventions range from farm and 
non farm-based livelihood, water 
conservation, on-ground training for 
farmers, creation of Farmer Producer 
Organisations, sanitation to Natural 
Resource Management. We facilitate 
livelihood enhancement opportunities, 
particularly for women and youth, 
primarily in agriculture and allied 
areas such as dairy and poultry. The 
objective is to help them find jobs 
locally, enhance their household 
income and discourage migration.

Creating sustainable 
livelihood opportunities

Unemployment is a significant issue faced by 
many in the district of Idukki. It’s more prevalent, 
however, in the underdeveloped hamlet of 
Maniyarankudy - home to the socioeconomically 
marginal Mannan tribal community known for 
their unique customs and traditions.

To generate livelihood opportunities in the 
region, particularly among the women of the 
community, Parivartan established a tailoring 
unit and training centre after selecting and 
training a group of eight beneficiaries to run it. 
The first batch of 10 trainees are now involved 
in teaching stitching. Equipment provided to the 
centre by the Bank include furniture, tailoring 
machines, cutting machines, embroidery 
machines and other related accessories. 
In addition to monitoring by field staff, the 
programme was also linked to the Start-up 
Village Entrepreneurship Program (SVEP) so that 
it may be replicated across the state.

Each beneficiary chosen to run the centre, earns 
around `2,200 per month. Upon completion of 
the 3-month training period, the trainees are 
expected to find sustainable employment - thus 
setting in motion the gradual improvement of 
living standards in the region.

Our Sustainable Livelihood Initiative (SLI), a 
unique programme with possibly no parallel 
globally, is targeted at empowering families by 
empowering women through occupational skills 
training, financial literacy, credit counselling, 
livelihood finance and market linkage. 

We also provide infrastructure support, such 
as building toilets in schools and improving 
classrooms. At the community level, it also 
includes educating people on the importance 
of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH). Also, 
through the Zero Investment Innovations for 
Education Initiatives (ZIIEI), we are committed 
to enabling teachers to innovate which in turn 
benefit students. This programme is aimed at 
Government schools across India. Parivartan 
is thus not just about bringing a sustainable 
change in the society, but also about  
delivering long-term solutions for pressing 
social challenges.

Embedding ESG parameters 
in business strategy

At HDFC Bank, we factor in environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects 
while designing our products, processes and policies. Our ESG strategy focuses 
on climate change, community and society, along with practices related to 
people, customers, lending, procurement, and governance. 

ESG governance 

CSR & ESG Committee of the Board 
oversees the Bank’s sustainability and 
climate change initiatives. A management 
level ESG committee, represented by 
senior management members across 
major functions, reports to the CSR 
& ESG Committee of the Board and 
provides updates on our Environmental 
Policy and ESG framework to the Board 
for review annually. Our Group Head for 
CSR reports to the Board every quarter, 
chairs the management-level ESG 
Committee which undertakes focuses 
discussions through three  
sub-committees.

Targets

Our Environment Sub-Committee, part 
of the ESG Committee sets targets and 
identifies opportunities for improvement 
in areas of emissions, energy, water 
and waste. This is driven jointly by 
the Sustainability team with the ESG 
committee which reviews plans of 
action, targets, progress against targets, 
initiatives undertaken by internal business 
units and employees towards mitigation. 

We have recently set a target to 
become carbon neutral by FY32. 
We have achieved our earlier target to 
reduce energy consumption and overall 
emissions by FY22. We have now initiated 
the process to commit to the Science 
Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), which will 
enable us to set climate change targets 
in accordance with the latest climate 
science to meet the goals of the Paris 
Agreement. We have also taken up a 
target to plant 2.5 Million trees by  
FY25, of which 1.6 Million trees have 
already been planted.

Our Board sets the course and evaluates our 
performance on social and environmental 
responsibility, among others. The Board-governed 
environmental policy serves as a framework to 
understand and manage our environmental risks, 
impacts and opportunities. We continuously strive to 
incorporate environmentally responsible practices in 
our own operations, through our vendors, as well as 
through responsible financing. There were no cases 
of non-compliance with environmental laws and 
regulations during FY21. We have also put in place a 
Social & Environmental Management System (SEMS) 
framework to assess social and environmental risks 
for all loan applications with a ticket size above 
`10 Crore and a tenure of five years. We have also 
initiated steps towards the implementation of TCFD 
and SBTi recommendations. We track our GHG 
emissions and transparently report our environmental 
performance annually.

Performance indicators 
and targets 

Initiatives to reduce 
environmental footprint

Targets FY22

We monitor key performance indicators 
(KPIs) for all major environmental 
indicators and initiatives covering 
energy, GHG emissions, and waste 
for all our operations with the aim to 
minimise the environmental impact. 
We have surpassed our target to 
reduce energy consumption and overall 
emissions. In FY21, to further reinforce 
our corporate climate strategy, we have 
initiated the process to commit to the 
Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), 
which will enable us to set climate 
change targets in accordance with the 
latest climate science to meet the goals 
of the Paris Agreement. We have also 
set a target to become carbon neutral 
by FY31-32.

We are committed to conducting our 
business operations in a socially and 
environmentally responsible manner. 
We explore, develop and adopt 
business models to ensure low-carbon 
transformational growth across the 
entire value chain, thereby contributing 
to worldwide efforts to limit global 
warming to below 2°C, and move 
towards a sustainable future. We are 
incorporating both technological as well 
as process solutions in our day-to-day 
operations to make a positive impact on 
the environment.

Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time. At HDFC Bank, we 
have been recording our GHG emissions since 2010 and are continuously transforming our 
operations to achieve low-carbon growth. 

Reduced paper emissions 

Paper use accounted for about 
one-third of our Scope 3 emissions 
in FY21 and is thus one of our 
priority intervention areas. Our retail 
marketing team rolled out, Green Event 
Guidelines, through which we saved 
about 1.5 Million square feet of paper 
during the period under review. We are 
also switching to recycled paper, which 
accounted for nearly 13% of our total 

paper consumption in the reporting 
period. Our digital strategy has also 
enabled us to drastically reduce our 
paper consumption and helped avoid 
related emissions. Additionally, our 
digitised processes and products 
have helped customers reduce their 
frequency of visits to our branches, 
ATMs and Offices, thereby reducing 
associated emissions

Tree plantation 

We are implementing a very ambitious 
tree plantation programme. So far, 
we have planted 1.6 Million+ trees, 
which not only helps sequester some 
GHG emissions, but also provides 
an opportunity to further improve our 
connect with the communities.

We have been able to achieve a consistent reduction in our absolute emissions, as well as in Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emission intensity over the years. During FY21, not only our emission intensity (per ` Crore total income) decreased by 
over 27% Y-o-Y, but we also achieved a reduction of over 23% in absolute scope 1 and scope 2 emissions owing to our 
multi-pronged initiatives to reduce GHG emissions, as well as the pandemic-induced restrictions that resulted in some of 
our teams working from home, reducing the activity load at some of our operating locations.

Energy efficiency and energy management

Over 95% of our GHG emissions are attributed to energy consumption – purchased electricity from the grid and diesel 
consumption in DG sets. We are aggressively working to reduce our energy consumption across operations to complement 
our initiatives to decarbonise our energy consumption. We have made significant progress in this regard, by regulating existing 
equipment, installing energy-efficient equipment, and implementing automated energy management solutions, among others.

Energy efficient lighting

We have replaced over 12,000 
conventional/CFL/fluorescent fittings 
with LED lights at 248 of our locations 
across 22 states and UTs, resulting 
in potential energy savings of over 
1 Million kWh of electricity per year. 
Henceforth, all building premises that 
we occupy will have only LED lights.

Energy efficient space 
cooling

In FY21, we installed EC Fan Motors in 
55 Air Handling Units (AHUs) resulting 
in potential savings of 0.2 Million kWh of 
energy per year. We have also installed 
inverter ACs at our locations, which 
helped save over 1.75 Million kWh of 
electricity during FY21. We also saved 
32,325 kWh of electricity by installing 
VRF HVAC units at our back offices. 

Efficient data centres

Disposal of old assets at three of our 
data centres led to the avoidance of  
1.4 Million kWh of electricity during 
FY21. Our Bangalore data centre 
‘Netmagic-DC3B’ is a certified 
green data centre under the IGBC 
Green Data Centre Rating System. 
We have implemented several other 
energy-saving measures including 
upgradation to efficient cooling units, 

IGBC Platinum Certification 
for our data centre in 
Bangalore

cold-aisle containment, replacement 
of old storages and servers and 
with new generation hardware, and 
implementation of Smart iPDUs. We 
have also adopted environment-friendly 
measures at our data centres such 
as switching to R-407c refrigerant for 
INROW cooling, adoption of new fire 
suppression system with NOVEC 1230 
gas, and replacement of UPS batteries 
with Li-ion batteries. 

Building management 
and Green Buildings

We have incorporated several changes 
within our infrastructure to improve 
energy efficiency through auto controls 
and environment-friendly equipment. 
We have LEED Gold certified offices in 
Mumbai and Bhubaneswar. In addition, 
new buildings in Mohali and Palava 
training centres are being constructed 
to meet the IGBC gold certification 
standards. We have also implemented 
elevator and equipment scheduling to 
reduce our energy consumption, and 
installed occupancy sensors, capacitor 
banks as well as Building Management 
Systems at several of our operating 
locations. The energy management 
module with auto controls deployed 
across select branches since FY19 
resulted in potential energy savings 
of about 16%. We plan to extend 
this initiative to an additional 2,000 
branches across the country.

During FY21, not only our energy 
intensity (GJ/employee) decreased 
by over 30% over FY20, but we also 
achieved a reduction of over 28% in 
absolute energy consumption. The 
reduction in energy consumption 
is attributed to the comprehensive 
set of energy reduction measures 
implemented at our operating locations, 
as well as the temporary reduction 
in activity/energy load at some of 
our operating locations as a result 
of COVID-19 induced lockdown and 
movement restrictions.

We also surpassed our energy targets. 
In FY21, we achieved a reduction 
of about 34% in absolute energy 
consumption, and 24% in energy 
intensity (GJ/per employee) from base 
year FY19.

Renewable energy

We are continuously increasing the share 
of renewable energy in our total power 
consumption. We now have solar power 
plants at our operations across six cities 
– Jaipur, Pune, Noida, Bhubaneswar, 
Chandigarh and Mumbai. 

During FY21, we commissioned a 52.8 KWp solar plant at 
our office in Mumbai, taking our cumulative installed solar 
capacity to 198.3 KWp, as on March 31, 2021.  
To realise the potential of renewable energy, we endeavour to 
install solar panels in our upcoming office buildings wherever 
feasible. Further, in some rural areas where power fluctuation 
is high, we have installed solar-powered ATMs.

66

Cumulative solar power generation capacity 
commissioned as of 31 March 2021
198.3 KWp

We deal with three types of non-hazardous waste – e-waste, dry waste (paper waste) and wet waste (cafeteria, 
sewage), of which e-waste is disposed of through authorised recyclers. Hazardous waste within the Bank’s scope 
arising from diesel/fuel oil used in generator sets, is negligible. While we are progressively working to track paper 
waste from our operations, we have installed sewage treatment plants at some of our large office premises to treat 
wastewater before releasing it into municipal waste. 

In FY21, we generated 167.88 tonnes of e-waste, as a result of asset refresh, 
damaged and non-functional assets. We are also aggressively working towards 
minimising the use of plastic bottles. We have already replaced all single use plastic 
water bottles at our hub offices across India with multiple-use plastic bottles and 
glass jars in all meeting and video conferencing rooms.

Responsible 
financing 

We understand that our investment 
decisions may have an environmental 
impact. We are thus committed to 
exercising our position to enable a 
positive impact on environmental 
sustainability and equitable growth 
through our investments and lending 
practices. Environmental and social 
aspects are integrated into our overall 
risk assessment framework. We do 
not fund projects that have an adverse 
impact on environment, health, 
safety (EHS) levels. We do not lend 
to businesses that produce ozone-
depleting substances (CFC-11, CFC-12, 
CFC-113, Carbon Tetrachloride, Methyl 
Chloroform, Halons-1211).  

As a part of our credit policy, we 
evaluate all loan applications with a 
ticket size of more than `10 Crore 
and a tenure of more than 5 years, 
through our Social and Environmental 
Management System (SEMS) 
framework. In FY21, 463 loan proposals 
were screened and approved through 
the SEMS framework. 

The Product Responsibility sub-
committee of our ESG Action 
Committee focuses on identifying 
opportunities in the environmental and 
social space, such as Green Bonds. 
We aim to provide access to capital for 

environmentally sustainable projects 
that contribute to climate change 
mitigation. We also finance renewable 
energy projects, and to date, have 
underwritten financing for a cumulative 
capacity of 2,945 MW amounting to 
`10,869 Crore. We have also financed 
city-gas distribution networks under the 
Minimum Work Programme, with a total 
underwritten amount of `5,308 Crore 
for 935 CNG stations and over  
9.5 Million domestic connections.

In addition to our ongoing ambitious 
plantation programme, we promote 
the use of renewable energy through 
our social initiatives. The Bank 
invests in providing solar home lights, 
streetlights and water pumps as part of 
its community development projects. 
The solar water pumps are used in 
agriculture and for accessing drinking 
water. As of March 31, 2021, more than 
22,000 solar home lights have been 
deployed in rural areas, leading to 
potential avoidance of over 2,100 tCO2e 
per year. We have also deployed over 
9,700 solar streetlights across several 
villages, which would lead to additional 
avoidance of over 1,400 tCO2e per 
year. We also help our communities by 
creating water conservation structures. 
So far, we have supported construction 
of over 8,800 water conservation 
structures to enhance water storage 
capacity. We also supported the 
construction of 23,500+ household 
toilets, which will reduce the negative 
impact on the environment due to open 
defecation.

TCFD disclosures 

HDFC Bank acknowledges growing concerns of regulators, investors and clients arising from the climate 
risks facing companies, especially banks and financial institutions. The Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) provides an important framework for identifying climate related risks and 
opportunities, evaluating appropriate responses and disclosing key information to stakeholders. This is our 
second year working on the recommendations of the TCFD.

The Bank is exploring techniques to assess physical and transition risk of climate change. We also continue 
our endeavour to acquire granular data and test tools for developing climate risk assessment and scenario 
analysis. Further, we have been reporting on our climate change strategy, risks, opportunities and emissions 
to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).

Governance

Our ESG Action Committee, 
through its sub-committee 
on Product Responsibility will 
continue to focus on assessing 
Environmental & Social (E&S) 
risks, including climate risks in our 
operations while identifying new 
business opportunities in the  
E&S space.

We, at the Bank, have a robust Risk 
Management Group (RMG).headed 
by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), which 
drives risk management centrally in the 
Bank. The RMG is primarily responsible 
for implementing the risk strategy 
approved by the Board, developing 
procedures & systems for identifying, 
measuring, monitoring, assessing and 
managing risk. The Chief Information 
Security officer reports on updates from 
Business Impact Analysis and Disaster 
Response as well as cyber-security 
concerns for the Bank.

Credit managers analyse the 
environmental risks translating into 
Credit Risk from large loans, some 
with the help of a Lending Independent 
Engineer

The Bank's Group Head for Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) reports to 
the Board every quarter on updates 
from the Bank's sustainability (ESG) 
initiatives, chairs the management 
level ESG Action Committee that is 
functionally segregated into 3  
sub-committees for focused 
discussions.

The Environment Sub-Committee sets 
targets and identifies opportunities for 

68

improvement in areas of emissions, 
energy, water and waste to combat 
climate change.

A dedicated CSR & ESG team, 
led by the Head, Corporate Social 
Responsibility ideates and implements 
several social and environmental 
programmes of the Bank that are 
aimed holistic development of our 
communities (Under the social umbrella 
of ‘Parivartan’) environmental and 
sustainability reporting initiatives at 
the Bank, focuses on managing and 
mitigating climate change impacts 
through internal projects at the Bank, 
in partnership with the ESG Action 
sub committees (Infrastructure, 
Administration, IT and Risk teams 
at the Bank). Besides, dedicated 
Administration and Infrastructure 
teams at the Bank effectively manage 
and procure Bank’s infrastructure and 
oversee the Bank’s energy efficiency 
and emission reduction initiatives.

Strategy

The Bank has implemented a Board 
approved Stress Testing Policy & 
Framework which forms an integral 
part of the Bank’s ICAAP. Stress 
Testing involves the use of various 
techniques to assess the Bank’s 
potential vulnerability to extreme but 
plausible stressed business conditions. 
Climate linked scenario analysis is being 
explored in respect of the tools and 
data specific to the country, to conduct 
climate specific scenario stress testing. 
Given that climate risk is an emerging 
and long term risk for the Bank, we 

will consider adopting a suitable 
methodology/pathway to analyse the 
Bank’s exposures under different 
climate scenarios.

The Bank has established Board 
approved credit policies and 
procedures. Accordingly, the credit 
exposures are managed through target 
market identification, appropriate credit 
approval processes, post-disbursement 
monitoring and remedial management 
procedures. We recognise the inherent 
social and environmental/climate 
change risks in our loans and hence in 
addition to financial and governance 
performance evaluation, we have an 
Social & Environmental Management 
System (SEMS) framework for the 
assessment of social and environmental 
risks for all loan applications that are 
above `10 Crore in size and 5 years  
in tenure. 

Our robust business continuity plan 
incorporates insurance of our assets 
in case of disaster occurrences. We 
invest prudently in insurance and strong 
Business Continuity and Disaster 
Response systems. Affected assets 
serving as collateral in case of our 
loans, also increase our credit risks  
and this is factored in our credit 
appraisal process.

We realise that lending to certain 
sectors like the agricultural sector 
have inherent credit risks as a result 
of delayed monsoons/ droughts. We 
have taken steps to connect farmers 
to government initiatives and expert 
advice on weather, soil health and 
cropping patterns.

Risk types considered for climate-related risk assessments

Risk Management

Current 
regulation 

Emerging 
regulation 

Banks are a highly regulated entity in the country and mandates as part of current regulations are always 
integrated into the overall risk planning and assessment process. Current regulation is also factored in as part 
of the credit assessment process, especially through the SEMS (Social and Environment Management System) 
framework as part of which large loans are screened for environmental and social risks which also incorporates 
risk from violating environmental laws. 

Transition risk can impact the Bank's credit portfolio resulting from changes in the climate policy, technology, 
consumer and market sentiment during the adjustment to a lower carbon economy. This is particularly relevant 
in the case of policy changes that can result in loan defaults from certain sectors like coal, thermal and 
infrastructure. The Bank is exploring techniques for developing climate risk assessment and scenario analysis to 
analyse our portfolio at risk due to transition risk of climate change.

Technology 

While our digital environment and information security practices form the basis of our business today, being in the 
financial services sector, we do not anticipate technology as a risk type to cause considerable impact in climate 
risk. However, our digital banking products (low carbon) have leveraged technology as a driver to enable business. 

Legal 

Market 

Reputation

Acute physical 

In case of large loans, the Bank ensures that the project complies with all environmental laws of the land, failure of 
which could lead the loan converting into a non-performing asset in case the project enters into litigation for the 
same. This however does not pose a claim for the Bank. There are no other instances in which the Bank can be 
directly held responsible for climate related litigation claim. 

In the context of overall risk management, market risks are managed through a well-defined Board approved 
Market Risk Policy, Investment Policy, Foreign Exchange Trading Policy and Derivatives Policy that caps risk in 
different trading desks or various securities through trading risk limits/triggers. In the context of climate change, 
market could play an important role in shifting the demand and supply for certain products like green loans or 
bonds or in low carbon digital products. 

Reputation risk from community/ customer perception is a primary risk to our business and hence we invest in 
community and customer engagement through surveys to educate and inform them about the Bank's initiatives 
towards Environmental Sustainability. Further, the global investor community especially sovereign wealth funds 
and pension funds is increasingly factoring in ESG performance metrics to assess long-term profitable growth. 
We constantly endeavor to adopt environment friendly initiatives within our operations to demonstrate corporate 
responsibility. We also demonstrate our commitment to ESG, especially climate change by incorporating ESG 
aspects in its regulatory reporting like the Annual Report. Besides we also publish our GHG emissions and GHG 
footprint (third-party verified) in our sustainability reports and our Integrated annual report going forward.  
We also have a board governed ESG policy framework that integrates climate change strategy as part  
of our guidelines. 

Acute physical risks can impact the Bank's credit portfolio through bad debts as a result of damage to property, 
infrastructure and land, increasing credit risks. This is relevant also in the case of asset (that serve as collateral) 
destruction in the case of climate disasters. The Bank is exploring techniques for developing climate risk 
assessment and scenario analysis to analyse portfolio at risk due to physical risk of climate change. Besides, the 
Disaster Response and Business Continuity teams of the Bank conduct Business impact studies and have quick 
response mechanisms in place in case of scenarios like floods. 

Chronic physical 

Chronic physical risks are far into the future. The Bank is exploring the availability of granular data and tools which 
can help model the long term outcomes of chronic physical risks.

Metrics and Targets
Apart from monitoring impacts from our own operations, we intend to enhance our commitment to finance climate change 
solutions like energy transition, renewables, energy efficiency, sustainable transport, green buildings, climate-smart agriculture 
etc. We are in the process of defining KPIs and setting targets to help us monitor, manage and track progress towards our 
climate change strategy. This also includes a comprehensive assessment of our scope 3 emissions. Details on our metrics 
and targets have already been covered in the Environment section of the report.

Ensuring product quality and 
service delivery 

Robust Processes 
to Monitor Measures 

Ensuring product quality and service 
delivery becomes vital for business 
growth. We desire to achieve this by 
seeking customer feedback as well as 
benchmarking with the best-in-class 
business entities. We invite and review 
the performance on customer service as 
well as grievance redressal at different 
levels - Branch Level Customer Service 
Committees (BLCSCs), Standing 
Committee on Customer Service (SCCS), 
and Customer Service Committee of the 
Board (CSCB).

We have put robust processes in place 
to regularly monitor and measure quality 
of service levels not only at various touch 
points but also at a product and process 
level by a specialised team called Quality 
Initiatives Group (QIG), which also works 
towards implementing strategic initiatives 
of the Bank through customer experience 
management. As part of its continuous 
efforts to enhance quality of service, the 
Service Quality team carries out regular 
reviews, including mystery shopping, 
across various products/processes/
channels by following a structured 
calendar. Service Quality reviews span 
across all customer touch points.

Building a customer-
centric culture using Net 
Promoter System (NPS) - 
‘Infinite Smiles’
We, at the Bank, believe that delivering 
an outstanding customer experience is a 
strong differentiator for a great product 
and is key to a sustained competitive 
advantage. With this in view, we on-
boarded one of the top management 
consulting firms to help us develop and 
implement a Customer Experience (CX) 
programme called ‘Infinite Smiles’. This 
programme helps us establish employee 
behaviours and practices that leads to 
customer-centric actions and continuous 
improvements, in our offerings, 
processes, and policies.

A system for bottom-up measurement 
of customer loyalty is the cornerstone 
of this programme – which has been 
operationalised through our high velocity, 
closed-loop customer feedback system. 
The measurement encompasses key 
channels – Branch Banking, Virtual 
Channels and Contact Centres, critical 
episodes – In branch transactions, 
Service Interactions, Query/Request 
and Leads. We contacted around 43.5 
Million customers in FY21. 

Guided by our aspiration to move 
from score to systems, we have been 
working to institutionalise the process 
for addressing customer issues that 
transcend beyond measurement and 
create a culture of customer-centricity 
and agility. 

At HDFC Bank we believe that customer 
experience is the total journey of a 
customer’s interactions with a brand and 
is integrated with the customer’s entire 
lifecycle. Hence, we aim to improve 
customer’s advocacy (emotional, 
psychological, and physical connection) 
with the brand. Our ‘Infinite Smiles’ 
programme rests on three meticulously 
designed pillars – ‘Listen’; ‘Learn’; 
and ‘Act’ which enables us to embed 
customer feedback led transformation as 
a discipline into our systems, challenge 
what is considered as the standard, and 
offer a customer experience that places 
us amongst the greatest service brands.

1    Beyond strategic review 

item for the management: 

The aspiration to build a customer 
obsessed culture trickles down from 
the top management to our central 
and cross-functional teams. ‘Listen’, 
‘Learn’ and ‘Act’ is now a mantra used 
by everyone, every day to prioritise 
opportunities for improvement

2   Beyond benchmarking: 

We are diligently acting on practices to 
reinforce the employees’ commitment 
towards creating promoters. To 
achieve this, we are pursuing a culture 
of employee engagement through 
cascade workshops, coaching, 
trainings, recognition, and celebrating 
individual successes. 

3   Championing the change: 
We are continuously working to inspire 
the front-line with adequate training 
and coaching. Our ‘Smile Champions’ 
persistently work as NPS ambassadors 
at the frontline and central teams to 
foster demand for NPS in other parts of 
the business. 

4   Bias towards action: 

We are committed to translating the 
feedback into to CX initiatives. We 
are developing holistic ecosystems 
complemented with the requisite tools 
and framework that empower our 
employees to deconstruct customer 
feedback and inform about systemic 
improvements and strategic customer 
initiatives. We have conducted over 

84,000 huddles until March 2021 which 
has helped weave in a culture to review 
customer feedback, discuss actions 
and subsequently plan and execute 
improvements. 

We embarked on our journey to build a 
customer obsessed culture. It has been 
our constant effort to include everyone 
in the organisation and work together to 
achieve our CX ambition. 

Analytical marketing to 
drive customer centricity

Marketing initiatives backed 
by analytics and technology 
are important enablers to 
deliver a world class customer 
experience. We use advanced 
analytics to identify and target 
the right customer with the right 
product, at the right time, on 
their most preferred channel of 
communication with high levels 
of personalisation. Enabled 
through technology, AI led 
interventions and CRM systems, 
our physical channels and virtual 
contact centres are equipped for 
addressing all customer needs. 
To deliver highly personalised 
digital experiences, marketing has 
invested in the latest technologies 
to create frictionless digital journeys 
that allow customers to buy our 
financial products and services with 
zero or minimal physical interface.

Bank’s customer service initiatives

Mobile ATMs

49 Mobile Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) were deployed across 47 cities 
in India to assist customers during the lockdown. These ATMs eliminated the 
need to move out of localities to withdraw cash for exigencies. To ensure the 
safety and wellbeing of our customers and employees, we implemented several 
measures like frequent sanitisation and adherence to social distancing norms at 
the mobile ATMs.

Customers can conduct
15 types
of transactions using the mobile ATM

Mooh Bandh Rakho

Our Mooh Bandh Rakho campaign was aimed to help prevent cyber frauds and 
the spread of COVID-19 by means of wearing a mask and keeping one’s mouth 
shut (Mooh Bandh Rakho). The campaign was launched when the use of online 
banking services gathered momentum, as a fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Bank used artificial reality filters for the campaign which allowed customers to 
better absorb the message.

As a socially responsible corporate, we initiated Secure Banking workshops 
for customers and the general public across the country. In March 2021, we 
completed our 1000th workshop of educating people about Cyber Frauds and 
Secure Banking ways to counter online frauds. 

Campaign widely endorsed by: 
Police Officials, National Payment Corporation of India, ACI Worldwide 

Audience:
Law Enforcement Agencies, Senior Citizens, Channel Partners, Housing Societies, 
Educational Institutes and Society at large

Multiplying the power of knowledge – 
‘Business Banking Group (BBG) Workshops’ 

We believe in sharing knowledge with our customers. in  
FY21, we conducted workshops through which we reached 
out to Business Banking Group (BBG) clients.  
In these workshops, customers were informed about the 
impact of COVID-19 on the Indian economy, business 
cycle, various sectors, forex and markets, and were provide 
guidance on navigating the same.

HealthFirst Initiative

Inspired by the National Digital Health Mission, 
HDFC Bank under its HealthFirst initiative joined 
hands with Apollo Hospitals to provide Bank’s 
customers exclusive access to quality healthcare

Safety Grid for Social distancing

with trust, the Bank created physical markers on the ground 
to help people maintain the World Health Organisation 
(WHO) prescribed social distance while waiting in queue at 
a shop or an establishment. When the nation was fighting 
the pandemic, we decided to put the bank logo, known 
to millions of Indians, on the ground, for their safety and 
protection. 

It was rolled out in more than 10 cities – Mumbai, Pune, 
Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Bangalore,

HDFC Bank Festive Treats –

The festive season in India is that time 
of the year when Indian consumers tend 
to spend on themselves as well as their 
loved ones, without much inhibitions. 
They look for attractive deals and offers 
online and in stores. Keeping this in 
mind, we launched an industry-first 
property in 2019 – HDFC Bank Festive

offers and financial solutions. After the 
resounding success of the 1st edition, 
we returned with Festive Treats 2.0 in

brands as well as hyper-local offers 
from tie-ups with local merchants 
across semi-urban and rural locations.

To channelise creative energy and keep people motivated 
during the lockdown, we launched The Art Project,

groups. We created a dedicated microsite – a space 
to upload your creative output such as drawings,

Intellectual Capital

Staying ahead with smart banking

Digitisation is an important enabler for our vision to be recognised as a 
Bank which offers a distinctive customer experience. The Bank’s digitisation 
philosophy is inspired by empathy – for our customers and our associates.  
Hence, we are continuously designing products that make digital banking simple, 
easy, contextual, and highly secure. 

Our technology transformation 
is aligned with our digital 
strategy to bring agility in 
processes and in delivering 
outcomes.

Our approach is two-pronged 
- to digitise the current banking 
products and services and 
build for the future. Among 
other things, this approach 
involves ensuring that the core 
technology is always ‘ON’ and 
built for scale. Our channels 
and partnership sites are 
intuitive using data analytics 
and a digital stack that is future-
ready

Our digitisation initiatives are founded 
on our mission to emerge as a preferred 
bank with a “neo” customer experience, 
while also driving operational 
efficiencies, process optimisation, and 
productivity enhancements.

Digitising Customer Journeys 

We strive to transform the customer service paradigm by offering our potential and 
existing customers intuitive, zero-touch, paperless journeys. 

Integration of new-age technology 
and analytics in our processes, 
applications and APIs, enables us 
to offer differentiated experiences to 
our customers. We are increasingly 
using microservices and cloud-native 
applications to offer a comprehensive 
set of platforms and services to 
customers, starting from the on-
boarding stage and moving on to 
transactions and lifecycle management. 

Reimagining customer journeys  
and experiences

We are also increasingly developing 
APIs to make our products and services 
available outside our platforms with the 
ability to cater to the entire spectrum 
of our customers’ financial needs. Our 
aim is to extend end-to-end banking 
assistance throughout the transaction 
ecosystem for our customers. Our 
digital and technology systems are 
enabled to power customer interactions 
using analytics. We leverage data 
analytics, artificial intelligence, and 
machine learning to offer personalised 
services to our customers and enhance 
our underwriting capabilities.

Our key digital initiatives

Rural Digital Initiatives 

Digital Journeys

Intended to streamline all online 
forms, to provide consistency 
of customer experience through 
replication of an existing feature/
transaction/product/service currently 
available on other platforms, this 
initiative has helped us in offering a 
frictionless customer experience.

The end-to-end, straight through 
processing of Savings Account 
origination, has helped us offer digital 
and seamless customer onboarding 
to our new customers, reduce 
journey turn around time, ensure full 
KYC account activation, enhance 
user interface and experience, and 
offer a more robust journey within 
build validations. 

The digital journey created for 
Personal Loans was aimed at 
digitising the lending process to 
easily onboard new and existing 
customers with a significantly better 
experience. It has helped us achieve 
efficiencies in terms of faster credit 
decisioning and reducing costs. 

Our Rural Digital Initiatives align with 
GoI’s Digital India Initiative and has 
helped us penetrate Semi Urban & 
Rural (SURU) markets. With this, we 
have been able to extended banking 
services at Gram-Panchayat level as 
well as retail assets via CSCs and 
VLEs. 

Video KYC

Our Video KYC known as V-CIP 
service is designed for offering an 
enhanced on-boarding experience 
mostly for new to bank customers. 
This has helped us in reducing 
account opening TAT with higher 
conversions.

Customer Experience Hub

Customer Experience Hub (CXH) is 
a platform that would enable Omni-
channel banking for customers by 
enabling banking transactions on 
10+ self-assisted & agent-assisted 
channels. This platform would be 
powering transactions and information 
services that are consumed by 
channels in the front-end and, is 
intended to provide customers 
with personalised digital banking 
experiences, raise their engagement 
levels, and encourage them to adopt 
digital self-service workflows with 
conversational AI and ML.

Extending APIs for partners

This initiative has helped us extend 
APIs to internal and external platforms 
and achieve a larger distribution 
network for banking products/
services. It allows us to be present on 
the platform of choice of the customer 
and hence, power ecosystems 
through consistent STP journeys 
across multiple platforms.

Providing smart solution 

Problem Statement
Mrs Nalini Singh (name changed) from a small 
town in Madhya Pradesh wanted to urgently open 
a bank account to send across money to her 
parents. During the current pandemic with most 
of the offices closed and people becoming fearful 
of venturing out of their homes, it was difficult for 
Nalini to visit branch for In Person Verification to 
complete KYC for account opening. 

Video KYC Solution
In line with RBI guidelines on Video-based 
Customer Identification process, Bank has built 
a robust Video KYC solution for consent-based 
method of establishing the customer’s identity, for 
onboarding. The customers can now complete 
KYC process with convenience and safety from 
the comfort of their home, a video KYC call with 
Bank Official involves the process of verification 
of Customer’s Geographic location coordinates, 
Liveliness, Face Match and Document Verification.

With new Amendment of KYC norms by RBI, 
the VCIP solutions will be further leveraged to 
include new categories of customers such as 
proprietorship firms, authorised signatories and 
beneficial owners of Legal Entities and for periodic 
updation of KYC

On-boarding with Video KYC
Post customer’s consent and authentication, the 
customer receives a Video KYC link to complete 
the KYC process. Customer clicks on the link and 
is redirected to Video KYC page. The customer 
gets connected with the Video KYC Officer for 
customer identification and due diligence through 
Video Based verification process. The Video 
KYC Officer guides the customer step by step 
to capture KYC, Geo-coordinates (customer 
located within India), liveliness details and security 
checks. On successful verification of the customer, 
Video KYC Officer approves the application. The 
application is then sent to concurrent auditor 
for verification. The concurrent Auditor verifies 
compliance with KYC/AML policies & procedures 
and approves or rejects the application. Once 
approved, the customer is notified and account is 
regularised as Full KYC Account.

I must congratulate you on the 
seamless and quick service that your 
bank is providing to all present and 
potential customers to help set up 
an account. Also, I find worthy of a 
mention for Debojit from your team, 
who guided me through my video KYC 
to successfully complete it and the 
professionalism in his dealing made 
me even more confident about the 
customer focussed people that make 
up your organisation.

The process is very easy for 
the educated people and 
wish HDFC Bank to come up 
with something innovative 
which will help un-educated 
customers also to get the 
bank accounts opened 
instantly without any hassle.

The way you helped for Video KYC 
it is applicable. Demonstration given 
by you (VKYC officer) was really 
excellent. During recording also I 
could not complete in one go and 
you permitted me to take my own 
time to bring paper and adjustment 
of camera till my satisfaction.

I appreciate HDFC Bank for taking 
video call initiative. I stay in rural 
place and faced difficulty to open 
a new account. Being a mother of 
a 10 months old, its hard to go out 
because of COVID crisis. 

Great experience to complete KYC 
in a few steps. I am really Happy 
with service, and would like to 
Congratulate Mr. Suraj and video 
KYC Team for valuing us. Thanks for 
providing excellent Service such as 
Video KYC

Learning and development
We have put in place a Leadership 
Competency Framework, as well as 
a Functional Capability Framework to 
develop the competencies required to 
deliver on our strategic and operational 
objectives. Our training cycle begins 
with an onboarding programme. Our 
annual need assessment exercise 
forms the basis of our training modules 
with a view on regulatory compliance 
and governing laws. The Training Need 
Assessment support group facilitates 
training and measures the effectiveness 
of training initiatives. We adopt 
various modes for delivering trainings 
- classroom sessions, e-learning 
certifications, on-the-job training kits, 
guest lectures, exposure visits, among 
others. We have put in place well-
structured training modules to foster 
professional growth and personal 
development. We have designed 
curated development programmes 
for our people from every level and 
function. 

We continuously improve our training 
framework and delivery by collecting 
feedback from our employees for each 
of the concluded programmes. Our 
Talent Review Council meets twice a 
year to analyse employee feedback and 
address their concerns.

During the period under review, we 
navigated through the COVID-19-
induced challenges by conducting 80% 
of our training hours in e-learning mode. 
We more than doubled up our training 
from previous year which included 
over 1.8 Lakh person-hours of training 
on Human Rights and over 6.7 Lakh 
person-hours on anti-corruption, KYC, 
AML-CFT, among others. A zero-day 
onboarding programme (induction) was 
conducted for all new joinees covering 
human rights specific topics like Code 
of Conduct and Prevention of Sexual 
harassment (POSH), among others. On 
average, our employees spent over 106 
person-hours on training in FY21.

Employee wellbeing

Employee wellness is an integral 
component of our employee value 
proposition, centring around the 
value of ‘Care’. We constantly explore 
possibilities and opportunities to deliver 
the finest customer experience. In the 
process, we realised that an engaged 
workforce is not just a productive one, 
but also a key element for creating 
‘Happy Customers’. It begins with 
health. The key health issues at the 
workplace stem from sedentary 
lifestyle, coupled with improper posture 
and stress. We conduct regular medical 
check-ups and create awareness on 
best health practices. We also provide 
counselling to help our people deal 
with issues of mental health through a 
dedicated helpline. All our employees 
are provided medical cover. For our 
female employees on the path to 
embracing motherhood, we have a 
maternity care programme.

Female employees started receiving 
counselling under Healthy Motherhood 
Programme

In FY21, we aligned our on-going 
programmes to equip our people 
with the information and knowledge 
required to navigate through COVID-19. 
We rolled out ‘HDFC Bank Employee 
Medical Support Services related to 
COVID-19’ in September 2020, followed 
by ‘COVID-19 pandemic Situation 
Employee Assistance Services for 
HDFC Bank Employees’ in October 
2020 to support our employees 
affected by the pandemic. We also 
organised 15 Health Talk webinars on 
COVID-19 related topics.

There is an employee association at 
the Bank. As of FY21, 0.16% of our 
permanent employees are a part of this 
association. The Bank has an internal 
Memorandum of Settlements that may 
be interpreted as a collective bargaining 
agreement signed between the 
Management and Union office bearers. 
There are periodic negotiations with 
Union Office Bearers and Memorandum 
of Settlement is signed by Management 
to the extent of their benefits and 
service conditions – including any 
significant operational changes. We 
provide three months’ notice typically 
to employees and their representatives 
prior to implementation of significant 
operational changes that could 
substantially affect them. 

We strictly prohibit child labour, forced 
or compulsory labour in all forms at 
our operations. In addition, through 
our ESG policy framework, we strive to 
ensure that our vendors and suppliers 
abide by the labour laws and human 
rights – including prohibition of child

We strive to create and maintain 
an inclusive work environment for 
all our employees irrespective of 
gender, caste, creed, colour, sexual 
orientation, religion, among others. We 
provide equal and fair remuneration 
opportunities, irrespective of gender. 
We have adopted a gender diversity 
target to increase the representation of 
women in our workforce to 25% by  
FY25*. With this objective, we are 
working simultaneously on talent 
acquisition, as well as talent retention. 
We have launched a unique endeavour 
called Careers 2.0, which has provided 
a platform for transitioning back to work 
for skilled women professionals who 
had opted for a break due to family/
personal reasons. So far, we have 
onboarded 33 women through this 
initiative. 

*Excludes frontline staff and sales officers

We are also making efforts to prioritise 
female hiring, e.g., by offering additional 
referral bonus for women candidates. 
We have introduced policies and 
processes to enable women 
employees to manage professional 
and personal commitments – such 
as offering flexi work time and part-
time work arrangements with the 
objective of arresting attrition. To 
improve representation of women in 
leadership positions, we have designed 
a dedicated, multi-phased, three-
year-long leadership programme in 
middle-management, called the Career 
Accelerator Programme. Our flagship 
programme on diversity, ‘Shrishti’ aims 
to create a level-playing field for women 
employees. 

We understand the importance and 
potential of providing a supportive 
ecosystem for women to enable them 
to build successful careers. We work 
towards increasing sensitisation of 
managers and leaders across levels to 
enable them to develop a conscious 
and comprehensive understanding of 
the challenges women often face as 
a result of unconscious bias. As part 
of this initiative, we have launched an 
audio-visual campaign, ‘Uncovering 
Unconscious Biases’, which focuses 
on creating an inclusive work 
environment. We have also launched 
#IntentionalInclusion video series 
to create overall awareness around 
unconscious biases relating to gender, 
disability, age, marital status, sexual 
orientation, among others.

Employee Connect
We have created several events covering sports, arts, music, culture and nature, to enable 
employees to nurture themselves holistically. Apart from excelling in the professional space, 
employees get an opportunity to pursue and showcase their talent and interests. In FY21, 
keeping in mind the pandemic situation, our Employee Connect (EC) team converted all the 
existing initiatives in an online format and came up with new initiatives to engage with our

We are committed to ensuring 
holistic and sustainable development 
of our communities. Our CSR 
initiatives, through direct and indirect 
interventions, are also aligned with 
global goals. 

The past year was clearly an 
unprecedented one, especially for 
rural communities – not just in terms of 
the pandemic but also the economic 
challenges it brought with it.

With a total CSR  
expenditure of `634.91 Crore, 
we are one of the highest 
CSR spenders in India.

88

We continued to refine our strategy 
to respond to the pandemic-
induced challenges and enhanced 
the total value of our CSR support 
delivered across our programmes. 
Responding to the need for a collective 
effort to contain the pandemic, we 
contributed to the PM CARES Fund 
and have been working with our 
communities at the grassroots level 
for multi-dimensional development 
of their health, livelihood and natural 
environment.

Under Parivartan, our umbrella brand 
for social initiatives, we design and 
shortlist our programmes with the 
stakeholders through a participative, 

bottom-up and consultative process 
with the stakeholders. The programmes 
are implemented with the support 
of various NGO partners. The CSR 
department has put in place several 
internal systems and processes to 
monitor and evaluate the programmes. 
The CSR Committee reviews the 
progress on a quarterly basis. During 
FY21, there were no fines or non-
monetary sanctions due to non-
compliance with laws and regulations in 
the social area. No financial assistance 
was received from the government 
during FY21 with reference to our 
Financial Statements.

Parivartan – a step towards progress

Parivartan, which denotes change, 
seeks to bring about a meaningful 
difference to the lives of people, making 
them part of the national mainstream. 
We identify the most disadvantaged 
sections of society around our areas of 
operation and enable them – through 
direct or indirect interventions – to 
become self-reliant. Parivartan focuses 
on five distinct areas of socioeconomic 

empowerment: Rural Development, 
Education, Skill Training and Livelihood 
Enhancement Healthcare and Hygiene, 
and Financial Literacy and Inclusion. 
Parivartan is also at the forefront 
of responding to natural disaster 
response – restoring infrastructure and 
rehabilitating communities.

1   Rural Development 
The Holistic Rural Development Programme (HRDP) was born out of the conviction that the 
progress of India is dependent on the growth of its rural economy. Over half the country’s 
population lives in rural areas and primarily relies on agriculture for livelihood.  
We undertake focused interventions in the areas of soil, farm-based livelihoods, water, 
conservation, on-ground training for farmers, creation of Farmer Producer Organisations, 
education, sanitation and Natural Resource Management.

A digital platform for CWMI with NITI Aayog

In order to get an annual snapshot 
of the water sector status and 
water management performance 
of India’s different states and UTs, 
HDFC Bank Parivartan and NITI 
Aayog came together to create the 
Composite Water Management 
Index (CWMI). The digital initiative 
will make CWMI accessible 

to public while digitising the 
entire process of ranking states. 
Data for crucial indicators such 
as groundwater restoration, 
irrigation management, on-farm 
water use, rural/urban drinking 
water supply as well as water 
policy frameworks can be viewed 
in various formats for agencies 

to forecast, plan and manage 
water resources. The results of 
the entire exercise will be used 
to propel action in the states to 
improve respective outcomes, 
besides improving upon data 
collection and performance 
monitoring mechanisms.

2   Promotion of Education
The programme is being executed in partnership with several leading non-governmental 
organisations. It encompasses teacher training, scholarships, career guidance as well as 
infrastructure support, such as building toilets in schools and improving classrooms. 

The ‘Teaching the Teacher’ (3T) 
programme seeks to transform 
education in government schools 
across India by improving the skills of 
teachers. Our flagship Zero Investment 
Innovations for Education Initiatives 
(ZIIEI) was launched under the 3T 
programme to find and systematically 
scale up scattered, unrecognised 

but effective and zero-cost solutions 
created by teachers to improve existing 
systems and processes. Under 3T, 
teachers across 28 states/union 
territories have been trained, by inviting 
ideas from them and implementing the 
selected ideas in schools to improve 
the quality of education. 

In addition, with the objective of making 
learning fun and engaging for the 
students, we integrated technology with 
education and have so far supported 
state-run schools in eight states by 
introducing digital classrooms.

3   Skill Training and Livelihood Enhancement

Stories of change

Under our Skill Training and Livelihood Enhancement programme, we target people in rural 
India and impart income generating skills, primarily in agriculture and allied areas such as 
dairy and poultry. 

The objective is to empower the 
disadvantaged gain access to better 
opportunities, help them find jobs 
locally, enhance their household 
income and discourage migration. This 
programme alone has benefitted over 
1.7 Lakh people since its inception. 
As part of this, thousands of youth 
have received placement-linked skill 

development training thus far. Under 
this programme, we also provide 
career counselling to school students. 
During FY21, we responded to the 
need to create a skilled workforce 
to support our healthcare system, 
which was under immense pandemic-
induced stress. We trained Auxiliary 
Nurse Midwife (ANM) nurses in three 3 

Nursing Kaushal Colleges in Jharkhand, 
and plan to replicate this model in other 
states to enhance India’s ANM nursing 
throughput by 50%, with a goal of 
extending COVID-19 training to public 
healthcare workers.

Zero Budget for a

Education for a  
healthy future 

Dhanegao, Mujampeth, Hasapur and 
Nasratpur villages, Nanded District, 
Maharashtra 

The lack of hygiene is a serious issue for women in 
rural India due to inadequate resources coupled with 
traditional societal customs. Many of Nanded’s young 
women and girls are no different - and were ignorant 
of even basic hygienic measures.

We partnered with CARD organisation to conduct 
health camps in the selected four villages

These camps were used to raise awareness on 
hygiene issues specific to girls as well as to counter 
certain harmful, popular social trends with body 
positivity.

Haemoglobin levels of 127 girls were tested and were 
found to be below average.

The initiative impacted 151 
beneficiaries. It is being overseen by 
Tuljai Pathology, set on a mission to 
spread female hygiene awareness in 
Nanded’s rural communities.

Bindki Block, Fatehpur District, Uttar Pradesh 

Over 90% of Uttar Pradesh’s land belongs to marginal 
farmers. Market demands have forced majority of 
these farmers to shift from local resource based and 
labour-intensive agriculture to monocropping using 
artificial fertilisers and machines, resulting in the 
widespread degradation of soil quality and increasing 
input costs.

We partnered with Shramik Bharti to introduce 
Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) in 5 villages.

Farmers were collectivised under a Farmers 
Producer Organisation (FPO), and capacitated to 
undertake natural farming through exposure visits.

Farmers were provided agri-tools such as potato 
weeders and seed drills. Krishi-Mitras were developed 
in each of the villages to create a local resource pool 
that would be accessible to farmers 24/7. Additionally, 
community seed banks were established to allow 
sustainable usage of seeds.

While slow in taking off the intervention has 
gradually resulted in the creation of a sustainable 
livelihood for the farmers. The development of their 
skills has not only allowed them to bargain for better 
market rates but has also made them confident 
enough to open an agri processing unit for flour, gram 
flour, rice, mustard oil and spices. Overall, farmers 
in the region now make profits that range between 
`8,000 to `10,000 per month, thus drastically 
improving their socio-economic situation.

Stories of change

Empowering youth to 
improve employability

Infrastructure Development 
for better irrigation

Natun Salmora, Lakhimpur District, Assam

Pachdi village, Sohagpur, Madhya Pradesh

Manasjyoti Barik is a young college dropout and the 
only earning member in a family of five. He faced 
immense financial difficulties in making ends meet, 
tried hands at various professions without much 
success in absence of any vocational skill.

We partnered with IGSSS to provide training to 
Manasjyoti on Animal Husbandry at Lakhimpur 
College of Veterinary Science in 2018.

In line with his interest in poultry farming, he was 
provided with 200 chicks for the development of his 
farm in addition to a chicken cleaning machine to help 
with quick cutting and selling.

In 2020, Manasjyoti opened his meat 
cutting and selling shop. With aid 
of training and further support, he 
is earning `15,000 to `20,000 per 
month and has been able to purchase 
many batches of chicks. His income 
has increased to around `45,000 per 
month after he opened his shop.

Agriculture is the main source of livelihood in the 
village but remains highly under developed with 
poor civic infrastructure. The area ranked low in all 
important human development indicators such as 
infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, literacy 
and sanitation.

We partnered with Action for Social Advancement 
(ASA) for the construction of 3 new stop dams and 
renovation of 13 existing structures.

The structures were constructed with the help of the 
community participation.

The structures have a collective water holding 
capacity of 6 Crore litres over 2 years; and a capacity 
to irrigate over 200 acres of land.

More than 400 farming households are getting better 
irrigation facilities in a 750-acre area while more than 
1,500 farmers have benefited through the recharge of 
downstream structures.

Due to the stop dam construction, 
the cultivable area of the region has 
increased as well. As a result, farmers 
have started sowing Rabi crops, 
leading to an increase in income and 
food security along with a decrease in 
seasonal migration.

The Sustainable Livelihood Initiative (SLI) is our flagship programme under Skill 
Training and Livelihood Enhancement through which we aim to ‘create sustainable 
communities’ by empowering women and helping them break the vicious 
circle of poverty. 

We support women by forming 
Self Help Groups (SHGs) or Joint 
Liability Groups (JLGs) by providing 
occupational skills training, financial 
literacy, credit livelihood finance, and 
market linkage. We have started SLI 
EMI collections through Common 
Service Centres (CSCs) Village Level 
Entrepreneurs (VLEs) providing 
customer convenience at the village 
level.

4   Healthcare and Hygiene

Employee volunteering programme

We have been actively championing the cause of Swachh Bharat through several sanitation 
projects with a focus on infrastructure creation, complemented by driving behavioural 
changes. At the heart of these programmes are community-led sanitation campaigns that 
promote hygienic conditions in rural areas through appropriate wastewater disposal. We also 
organise health camps, nutrition programmes and vaccination drives. Our health camps not 
only offer diagnostic services, but also assist the communities on other healthcare-related 
aspects. At the community level, we educate people about water, sanitation and hygiene 
(WaSH) and create awareness on road safety and healthy financial practices. 

We also encourage dry waste 
management practices to improve 
and support resource utilisation, 
generate employment, and contribute 
to sustainable development goals. 
To mitigate environmental and health 
issues arising due to improper waste 
disposal, we have partnered with 

the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), India for dry waste 
management. Through this initiative, we 
aim to create an ecosystem with 5Rs of 
waste management – Refuse, Reduce, 
Reuse, Repurpose and Recycle – and 
bring waste pickers into the mainstream 
through social and financial inclusion.

Plant on-the-go

Go green at home

To encourage our employees to do 
their bit for making their surroundings 
greener, we distributed over 500 
‘seedbombs’ (mud balls consisting of 
seeds) among our staff in Mumbai. The 
‘seedbombs’ were specially made by 
tribal women from Mumbai and villagers 
in Madhya Pradesh.

We adapted our plantation drive to 
the prevailing COVID-19 situation. We 
encouraged our employees, along with 
their family, to plant saplings in their 
homes or in the vicinity.

‘Making a Difference’ 
initiative

We started a Virtual Volunteering 
Programme to reach out to students 
and youngsters in distress due to 
COVID-19 induced restrictions and 
economic slowdown. As part of this 
programme, we partnered with NGOs 
to create diverse and interactive virtual 
programmes, ranging from mentoring 
marginalised students to training staff of 
smaller NGOs with organisational skill 
sets.

Over 120 employees spent 86 hours 
cumulatively volunteering under this 
programme.

Combating 
COVID-19

98

Our COVID-19 response 
was guided by a spirit of 
developing closely-knit 
working relationships with 
Government and civil society 
to contain the spread of the 
virus and manage the crisis 
from a socio-economic and 
healthcare standpoint.

Extending support to the 
Government 
In FY21, recognising our responsibility towards 
the frontline warriors in the nation’s fight against 
the pandemic, we supported seven state/district/
city level institutions by providing face masks, 
sanitisers, gloves, kits, thermometers, in addition 
to monetary support for procurement of medical 
equipment.
Supporting the 
underprivileged 
We aligned our efforts towards supplying 
essentials to the migrant returnees and their 
families, as well as daily wage earners – most 
affected by the COVID-19-induced lockdown. In 
addition to providing financial support to several 
implementation organisations, we ensured supply 
of care-kits consisting of dry ration and other 
essentials to villagers across Bihar, Odisha, 
Maharashtra, Haryana and Rajasthan. We also 
provided cooked meals to those in need across 
cities including Mumbai, Bhatinda, Lucknow and 
Patna through our employee volunteers.

Mobilised community 
support and action 
We undertook mass awareness campaigns 
through cycles and rickshaws to reach the 
most remote places. We also guided villagers 
to maintain social distancing in several states 
including Assam, Jharkhand, Odisha, Haryana and 
Rajasthan. To salute the indomitable spirit of our 
COVID-19 warriors, and to drive donations to the 
PM Cares Fund, we released an anthem of hope 
and positivity, #HumHaarNahiMaanenge  
(We will not give up) and pledged to contribute 
`500 to the PM Cares Fund every time the song 
was shared on social media. Collectively, we 
raised and donated `2 Crore as part of this 
initiative. 

5    Financial Literacy 
and Inclusion 

Financial literacy is the first step towards financial 
inclusion. We conduct financial literacy camps at 
our banking outlets as well as at financial literacy 
centres across the country through our NGO 
partners. The camps are aimed at empowering the 
communities with knowledge about fundamentals 
of savings, investment and organised finance, 
thereby enabling them to make smart financial 
decisions. Our flagship programme under this 
initiative, Digidhan criss-crosses the length 
and breadth of India’s hinterlands on wheels, 
explaining the benefits of digital banking through 
audio-visual mode.

Contributing to India’s growth 

The rural sector emerged as a bright spot in the post-pandemic economic 
recovery, driven by a favourable harvesting season, aided by reverse migration and 
limited spread of COVID-19. Central Government’s measures like Direct Benefit 
Transfer (DBT) provided a boost to rural incomes. At HDFC Bank, we enabled 
efficient and timely disbursement of funds to millions of beneficiaries under 
various schemes through Public Financial Management System in compliance to 
Government of India guidelines.

As part of our humanitarian efforts for COVID-19 relief, we extended support 
towards the fund raising efforts of the Central Government down to the district 
level. We opened hundreds of accounts for COVID–19 relief, and collected 
more than `1,500 Crore through our crowdsourcing efforts from our retail and 
corporate customers.

Ensuring seamless Direct 
Benefit Transfers 
We focus on timely disbursement of 
Government funds, including DBT 
payments, through PFMS while 
ensuring maximum coverage for eligible 
beneficiaries of important government 
schemes such as MGNREGA, PMAY, 
PMKSY, among others. The Bank 
processed 9% of the total value 
of Direct Benefit Transfers in FY21 
including disbursement of funds to 
12,000+ beneficiaries under Pradhan 
Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) 
for setting up micro-irrigation systems in 
their farms. 

Digitising Gram Panchayats (GP)
We have received mandates from 
the Government to work with Gram 
Panchayats (GPs) in eight leading states 
to open accounts for various schemes 
including those recently introduced by 
the 15th Finance Commission to enable 
ease of access to funds through PFMS. 
During the pandemic, we conducted 
webinars across states to help train 
GP staff to work more efficiently by 
maximising the use of digital solutions 
provided by us. 

Digitising agricultural 
procurements 
HDFC Bank is among the six banks to 
integrate with National Agriculture Market 
(eNAM), a pan-India electronic trading 
portal managed by the Small Farmers 
Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) under 
the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ 
Welfare. eNAM aims to integrate 2,000 
Agricultural Produce Market Committees 
(APMCs) across the country through a 
common online platform, providing better 
price discovery through a transparent 
auction process. We support the platform 
by streamlining the payment flow from 
trader to farmer. It ensures faster and 
more transparent payments to farmers.

Facilitating ease of doing business

Partnering with the Ministry of 
Corporate Affairs (MCA) 
As part of the Prime Minister’s 
‘Ease of Doing Business in India’ 
initiative, we are now integrated into 
the Government’s MCA 21 platform. 
This enables us to issue a Current 
Account number on a real time basis 
to businesses during the registration 
process with the Ministry. 

Increasing participation of 
MSMEs in government supply 
chain 
We have also integrated with the 
Government’s GeM Portal for 
accepting Caution Money Deposit for 
procurement through the portal. This 
improves transparency and enables 
ease of doing business for MSMEs 
when paying the deposit. 

First Indian private bank to 
facilitate salary disbursements 
for our soldiers
We became the first private bank 
in India to be given the mandate to 

establish a Smart Banking lobby (fully 
digital branch) at the 13 Base Repair 
Depot of the Indian Air Force. Further, 
the Ordinance Factory Board under 
the Defence Ministry has empanelled 
the Bank to set up salary accounts for 
their employees across the country. We 
are also enabling the digitisation of fee 
collection for 134 Army Public Schools 
run by the Army Welfare Education 
Society.

Ensuring efficient Government  
fund allocation
Deploying the parent-child accounting 
structure, along with a fund 
management solution, we enabled 
several Government departments 
to better allocate funds to regions 
based on utilisation levels, and reduce 
leakages through efficient expense 
tracking mechanisms. Hundreds of 
crores of leakages have been arrested 
in departments where these solutions 
have been implemented.

Taking banking to the unbanked

Common Service Centres (CSCs) 
CSCs play a pivotal role in taking our 
cost-effective services to the under-
banked in the hinterlands of India. 
Managed by Village Level Entrepreneurs 
(VLEs), CSCs serve as access points 
for delivering essential public utilities, 
healthcare, financial, education and 
agrarian services alongside social 
welfare schemes and diverse B2C 
services. 

EMI collections including 
delinquent and overdue 
The collection mechanism of delinquent 
and overdue amount has become 
easier since the inception of the BC EMI 
Collection Centres on 28 January 2021. 
Borrowing customers no longer need to 
visit the Bank to pay their EMIs, which can 
be carried out at one of 15,000 locations 
across India.

Developing an ecosystem 
for Healthcare Banking

The pandemic has brought to the 
fore the need for rapid digitisation in 
the healthcare space. At HDFC Bank, 
we are entering into alliances with 
digital healthcare providers to provide 
customised and cost-effective banking 
solutions to various user groups on their 
platforms. This ranges from ensuring 
faster access to funds and banking 
products to addressing the challenges 
of high-cost treatments, providing loans 
to doctors and hospitals. We have 
enabled partner hospitals to provide 
loans and EMI facility on Debit/Credit 
cards. 

Attractive offers on Debit Card/Credit 
Card are being listed on HDFC Bank’s 
SmartBuy platform for customers to 
save more on their wellness spends. 
As part of this initiative, Apollo Hospital 
Group has designed ‘The HealthyLife 
Programme’ exclusively for HDFC Bank 
customers and is providing 24/7 tele-
consultancy, free delivery of medicines, 
COVID-19 care and One Apollo 
membership. HDFC Bank is providing 
payment options and ease of finance for 
treatments at Apollo Hospitals. 

CSC Grameen eStores
The CSC Grameen eStore with more 
than 1.38 Lakh stores, establishes market 
linkages for local and small businesses. 
Since its inception in 2020, Grameen 
eStores have catered to more than 3.2 
Lakh customers, recording a turnover 
of more than `100 Crore. We have 
onboarded more than 40,000 Current 
Accounts of VLEs registered as Grameen 
eStore.

Small savings through Fixed 
Deposits
Small ticket or big ticket, Fixed Deposits 
(FDs) have been one of the most trusted 
investment options to secure ones 
money. HDFC Bank has enabled the 
VLEs to open FDs for customers in 
deeper geographies across the country.

Promoting entrepreneurship through 
SmartUp programme

At HDFC Bank, we work with various 
State Governments and incubators/
accelerators including the Indian 
Institutes of Technology (IITs) and 
the Indian Institutes of Management 
(IIMs) to promote entrepreneurship 
under our SmartUp programme and 
Startup fund. We work with 20+ 
incubators certified by the Department 
of Science and Technology. 

We also organise networking and 
mentoring sessions for our start-
up customers with HNIs and senior 
executives of the Bank. We have signed 
MoUs with five State Governments 
and the Ministry of Electronics and 
Information Technology (MEITY) to 
facilitate the execution of their start-
up policies. During FY21, we provided 
financial and advisory support to 21 
social impact start-ups in the Ed-tech 
and skill development sectors. 

Digital solutions

Mid-day Meal 
At HDFC Bank, we have enabled 
digitisation of the Mid-day Meal 
scheme by providing a digital solution, 
integrated with its disbursement 
channel. It enables centralised fund 
management for distributed financial 
operations at State, District, Block and 
School levels. Digitisation of entire Mid-
day Meal data provides a centralised 
view to the state nodal agencies and 
helps monitor and analyse expenditure 
for efficient fund management. The 
solution has been rolled out in the state 
of Jharkhand.

Education 
HDFC Bank has led the digitisation 
drive not only in Government schools 
and colleges but also at the State 
Education Department. This has 
been achieved through providing 
solutions enabling deserving students 
to access scholarships through digital 
evaluation and timely disbursement of 
scholarships.

Sustainable financing solutions

Green bond 
We at HDFC Bank are proud to be 
associated with the issuance of the 
First Green Bond by Ghaziabad 
Municipal Corporation. This is the first 
Green Bond issue by any Municipal 
Corporation in the country. Earlier, 
we managed the Lucknow Municipal 
Bonds issue, the first ever municipal 
bond issue from North India and Uttar 
Pradesh. Our Bank acted as Merchant 

banker, Escrow banker and Bankers to 
the Issue for both the Bonds.

The issues received an overwhelming 
response from the market and were 
over-subscribed multiple times. The 
role of the Bank was highly praised 
by the Government of Uttar Pradesh 
and we received an award for both the 
Lucknow and Ghaziabad Bonds.

Board involvement and

Policies and frameworks 
for ethical conduct

The Board plays a vital role in shaping, 
maintaining, and improving the Bank’s 
processes and practices. The onset of 
the pandemic required the Bank and 
its Board to rethink the way business 
is managed and ensure security, 
continuity and growth. Accordingly, one 
of the focus areas for the Board in  
FY21 was to deliberate on and explore 
new opportunities, leading to initiatives 
and actions around infrastructure 
scalability, resilient disaster recovery, 
security enhancements and enhanced 
monitoring mechanism. Employee 
safety and wellbeing remain a key 
priority area for the Bank, as the 
second wave of COVID-19 infections 
sweeps through the nation.

Culture of transparency 
and accountability

Transparency and accountability 
are among the key expectations of 
stakeholders. To this effect, the Board 
has always encouraged adoption of 
global best practices in governance, 
timely disclosures, and fair presentation 
of information. We have established 
practices that allow for a sufficient 
and visible flow of information, with 
adequate safeguards in place. We have 
also formulated a Code of Practices 
and Procedures for Fair Disclosures in 
accordance with the SEBI (Prohibition 
of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015. 
This Code lays down principles of 
prompt disclosure and uniform and 
universal dissemination of information. 
Further, the Board has approved the 
following policies which are available on 
our website for easy reference:

•  Policy for appointment and fit and 

proper criteria of Directors

•  Charters of Board-level committees

•  Whistle Blower Policy

We drive ethical conduct in our day-to-
day operations. To ensure a pervasive 
culture of ethical behaviour, we have 
created an environment and instituted 
policies and frameworks that encourage 
appropriate business conduct. These 
policies are communicated regularly to 
the management, employees and other 
stakeholders.

Our corporate governance  
policies include 

•  Code for corporate governance 

•  Policies to prevent insider trading, 
govern related-party transactions 

•  Policies around Prevention of Sexual 

Harassment (POSH) 

•  Environmental Social & Governance 

(ESG) Policy Framework

Code of Conduct and  
Whistle-blower Policy

We promote an open and transparent 
system of working and dealing with 
our stakeholders. While our Code 
of Conduct & Ethics Policy directs 
employees to uphold our values and 
conduct business worldwide with 
integrity and highest ethical standards, 
our Whistle-blower Policy provides a 
comprehensive framework for capturing 
and addressing stakeholder complaints/
grievances. We did not make any 
political contributions during FY21. 

Our publicly available Conduct 
Philosophy document defines 
mechanisms to deal with issues related 
to inhumane treatment including 
mental or physical coercion or verbal 
abuse, sexual harassment, sexual 
abuse, slavery, of employees. During 
FY21, there were no complaints of 
infringement of human rights.

Customer satisfaction

The Customer Service Committee 
of the Board (CSCB) comprises a 
majority of non-executive directors and 
is tasked to bring about continuous 
improvements in the quality of services 
rendered to our customers. It also 
ensures the implementation of directives 
received from the RBI in this regard. 
Accordingly, the CSCB formulates the 
Bank’s comprehensive deposit policy 
incorporating the issues arising out of 
the product approval process, annual 
survey of depositor satisfaction, the 
triennial audit of such services, among 
others.

We strictly adhere to market conduct 
regulations to inform our customers and 
clients with transparent, accurate, and 
comprehensive marketing statements, 
advertising, and product-/service-
labelling. We have defined framework, 
strategy, policies, procedures and have 
put in place systems to ensure and 
maintain transparency in communication 

with our customers and clients to help 
them make informed decisions.  
During FY21, we didn’t record any case 
of non-compliance concerning product 
and service information and labelling, or 
marketing communications.

Customer Privacy, Information 
Security, and Data Protection are of 
paramount importance to us. The IT 
Strategy Committee is headed by an 
Independent Director with experience 
in the IT sector and also comprises 
an information technology expert, as 
well as an external expert. We adhere 
to the ‘Code of Bank’s Commitment 
to Customers’ as prescribed by the 
Banking Codes and Standards Board 
of India (BCSBI) and Employee and 
Customer Awareness Procedures to 
ensure customer privacy. We have 
in place a governance framework, 
information security practices, and 
business continuity plan to mitigate 
information technology-related risks. 

We are also guided by the Information 
Security Policy and Cyber Security 
Policy, followed by an independent 
assurance team within Internal Audit 
which provides assurance on the 
management of information technology-
related risks. 

The Bank conducts vulnerability 
assessment of its IT systems through 
an external entity, and the report thus 
provided to the Bank is incorporated 
by the IT team for remediation. During 
FY21, we received no complaints 
regarding identified leaks, thefts, or 
losses of customer data with respect 
to data security. During the same 
period, we received 36 complaints 
from customers concerning breaches 
of customer privacy, of which two were 
received from outside parties and two 
were from regulatory bodies. 

The Bank has a well-defined Grievance 
Redressal Mechanism for recording the 
complaints received through various 
front-end channels such as Branch/
Phone Banking /Email Management 
Support Unit. All customer complaints 
received across branches/front 
channels are logged in a state-of-the-
art centralised complaints management 
system – CRMnext – for tracking 
and resolution. Credit Card-related 
complaints are logged in the CBCI 
and other bank ATM transaction-
related complaints are logged into the 
DCD (Debit Card Dispute) system. 
An escalation matrix is built into this 
system to ensure customer complaints 
are closed adequately within stipulated 
timelines.

As a result of our 
continuous efforts, we have 
been consistently reducing 
our complaint resolution 
turnaround time – from 8 
working days in FY18 to 5 in 
FY21.

ESG Governance

Governance in areas of ESG or 
sustainability is an essential element 
of the governance framework of the 
Bank. The Environmental Social & 
Governance (ESG) agenda is driven 
through a management-level ESG 
Action Committee which reports to the 
CSR & ESG Committee of the Board. 
The Committee oversees sustainability 
reporting initiatives, climate change 
disclosures, internal projects to 
ensure reduction in the Bank’s overall 

emissions and tracks its progress on 
ESG to achieve industry leadership. The 
sustainability team works in tandem 
with different stakeholders within the 
Bank to achieve set targets in line 
with the ESG Policy and framework. 
For better focus and monitoring, we 
have set up various sub-committees 
of the ESG Action Committee – the 
Environment sub-Committee, the Social 
& Governance sub-Committee and the 
Product Responsibility sub-Committee.

charge backs etc.

Assurance Procedures

Our assurance process involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the reliability of specified disclosures. The 
nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the selected non-financial disclosures whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we 
have considered internal controls relevant to the preparation of the Report in order to design assurance procedures that are 
appropriate in the current circumstances. 

Our assurance procedures also included:

•  Assessment of HDFC Bank’s reporting procedures regarding their consistency with the application of GRI Standards.
•  Evaluating the appropriateness of the quantification methods used to arrive at the non-financial disclosures presented in 

the Report. 

•  Review of systems and procedures used for quantification, collation, and analysis of non-financial disclosures included in 

the Report. 

116

•  Understanding the appropriateness of various assumptions, estimations and materiality thresholds used by HDFC Bank 

for data analysis. 

•  Assessment of data reliability and accuracy. 
•  Review of selected key performance data as defined in scope, boundary and limitations was carried out on a sample 

basis through screen sharing tool with corporate office

Appropriate documentary evidence was obtained to support our conclusions on the information and data verified. Where 
such documentary evidences could not be collected due to sensitive nature of the information, our team verified the same 
with the HDFC Bank during virtual interactions.

Conclusions  

We have reviewed selected non-financial disclosures in the report of HDFC Bank for FY 2020-21. Based on our review and 
procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to believe that the non-financial performance 
data and information as per the scope of assurance presented in the Report is appropriately stated, in all material respects 
and in accordance with GRI Standards. 

We have provided our observations to the Bank in a separate management letter. These, do not, however, affect our 
conclusions regarding the Report.

Independence

The assurance was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including professionals with suitable skills and experience in 
auditing environmental, social and economic information in line with the requirements of ISAE 3000 (Revised) standard. 

Our work was performed in compliance with the requirements of the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, which 
requires, among other requirements, that the members of the assurance team (practitioners) be independent of the assurance 
client, in relation to the scope of this assurance engagement, including not being involved in writing the Report. The Code 
also includes detailed requirements for practitioners regarding integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, 
confidentiality and professional behaviour. KPMG has systems and processes in place to monitor compliance with the Code 
and to prevent conflicts regarding independence. The firm applies ISQC 1 and the practitioner complies with the applicable 
independence and other ethical requirements of the IESBA code.

sustainability topics, establishing and maintaining appropriate performance management, internal control systems and

HDFC Bank Limited | Integrated Annual Report 2020-21Statutory Reports and  Financial StatementsOverviewIntroduction to HDFC BankOur PerformanceHow We  Create ValueOur StrategyResponsible BusinessDirectors’ Report

Dear Stakeholders,

Your Directors take great pleasure in presenting the 27th Annual 
Report on the business and operations of your Bank, together 
with the audited accounts for the year ended March 31, 2021.

First of all, wishing all of you health and happiness on behalf of 
the HDFC Bank family.

As the virus casts a shadow over the entire world, the first thing 
that  all  of  us  must  do  is  take  every  possible  step  to  ensure 
our  safety  and  that  of  our  loved  ones.  And  say  a  prayer  for 
our collective well-being. Especially for all the frontline COVID 
warriors who served the nation, often at great risk to their own 
lives. Our heads bow in respect for those who lost their lives in 
this fight. This includes some of our colleagues too.

It delivered a total rate cut (repo) of 115 bps since February 2020, 
taking the repo rate down to 4.0 per cent. The central bank also 
took a slew of measures to address liquidity constraints such 
as the announcement of moratorium, liquidity infusion through 
TLTRO  (Targeted  Long  Term  Repo  Operations)  for  NBFCs  
(` 500 billion), liquidity facility of ` 500 billion for mutual funds, 
liquidity support of ` 500 billion for all India financial institutions 
and  a  cut  in  the  Cash  Reserve  Ratio  (CRR)  by  100  bps  to  3 
per cent. These measures helped anchor borrowing costs in 
the economy, support credit growth and cushioned the impact 
of the disruptions in the financial market (Please refer to the 
Macroeconomic  and  Industry  section  on  page  128  for 
more details).

Needless  to  say,  the  pandemic  affected  the  economy.  
If FY 2019-20 was one of the most challenging years for  the 
Indian economy, then the challenges only multiplied in FY 2020-
21. And this was accentuated further by geo-political tensions.

The  year  started  with  one  of  the  most  severe  lockdowns  in 
the world. Although it was eased in stages, the economy was 
bound  to  take  a  hit.  For  the  first  time  in  many  years,  India’s 
GDP contracted  by 7.3 per cent in FY 2020-21. This was an 
improvement  after  the  first  quarter  low  of  -24.4  per  cent.  As 
the lockdown eased, the economy contracted by 7.4 per cent 
in the second quarter and touched positive territory in the third 
quarter, posting a growth of +0.5 per cent and 1.6 per cent in 
the fourth quarter.

The Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) 
announced a host of measures to cushion the direct impact of 
the  lockdown  on  the  economy.  The  Government  announced 
a stimulus package of ` 20 trillion in five different tranches in  
FY 2020-21 to provide support to 1) the MSMEs and the Non 
Banking Financial Companies via a credit guarantee scheme and 
liquidity support 2) Migrant labourers via direct spending, and 
generating employment via enhanced allocation to MNREGA, 
3) Small traders, vendors and farmers via loan facilities and 4)
Announced structural reforms across sectors like coal, power,
agriculture, etc.

On  the  monetary  policy  side,  the  RBI  also  took  a  number  of 
steps to provide liquidity and enhance credit flow in the system. 

The  Budget  announcements  for  FY  2021-22  too  have  given 
confidence  to  business  with  its  focus  on  stimulating  growth 
through expansionary fiscal policy at the centre and increasing 
capital expenditure at the central as well as state Government 
levels. 

While  all  these  have  been  clear  positives,  what  has  cast  a 
shadow on the economy again has been the resurgence of the 
pandemic in many parts of the country, resulting in partial or 
complete lockdowns. The mitigating factor has been the arrival 
of the vaccine and the decision to step up the vaccination drive 
by making all those over 18 years eligible for taking the vaccine. 
The Government has invited more manufacturers from abroad 
to come to India to boost supply in the country.

In this uncertain environment, your Bank continued on its growth 
path by conducting its business responsibly and reinforcing its 
commitment to the environment and community at large.

Financial Parameters
Your  Bank  recorded  an  improvement  in  a  majority  of  its  key 
financial parameters, largely due to its prudent credit evaluation 
of  targeted  customers  and  diversified  loan  book  across 
customer  segments,  products,  and  sectors.  Managing  risk-
return decisions with discipline also contributed to the Bank’s 
performance.  Net  Profit  at  ` 31,116.5  crore  went  up  by  18.5 
per cent. Net Interest Income at ` 64,879.6 crore rose 15.5 per 
cent. Net Interest Margin remained stable at 4.1 per cent. Gross 
Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) at 1.32 per cent were among the 
lowest in the industry.

Parivartan
Your Bank continued to transform lives through its umbrella CSR 
brand, Parivartan, which denotes change.

The  Bank  believes  that  businesses  can  only  prosper  if  the 
communities in which they operate prosper as well. This belief 
has inspired its social initiatives, which have potentially made a 
difference to the lives of over 8.5 crore people, predominantly 
in rural India. Driving this change is the Sustainable Livelihood 
Initiative  (SLI)  team,  which  employs  about  10  per  cent  of  the 
Bank’s workforce and works exclusively on improving livelihood 
opportunities.  The  ‘Teaching-The-Teacher’  initiative  has 
impacted  over  2  crore  students  since  inception.  The  Holistic 
Rural Development Programme has touched another 20 lakh 
people  across  more  than  1,970  villages.  Having  an  umbrella 
brand enables the Bank to lend a sharper focus to these efforts. 
Your Directors are also happy to report that your Bank met the 
mandatory CSR expenditure through a spend of ` 634.91 crore. 
The Bank contributed ` 70 crore towards Prime Minister’s CARES 
Fund to support the Government’s fight against the COVID-19 
pandemic.

Summary
In FY 2021-22, the pandemic and vaccination drive are critical 
factors for the pace of economic recovery. In the near-term, the 
resurgence of COVID-19 cases across the country does pose 
a risk to the pace of economic recovery but the absence of a 
national lockdown is a positive. This, of course, poses challenges 
for your Bank in the short run.

In the long run, the market in the post-pandemic recovery period 
presents tremendous opportunities, given the under-penetration 
of banking services in the country. Your Bank is well positioned 
to  capitalise  on  these  opportunities,  given  the  strength  of  its 
major franchises. It is also poised to make a greater contribution 
to bridge the urban-rural divide - be it through its business or 

social  initiatives.  This,  of  course,  will  not  be  possible  without 
the  contribution  of  the  ever-growing  family  of  over  two  lakh 
employees  (including  those  of  the  subsidiaries)  across  the 
country, who remain at the forefront of taking your Bank forward 
every day.

Your Directors would like to especially thank those who went 
well beyond their call of duty during the COVID-19 pandemic 
to  keep  your  Bank  functioning.  Many  of  them  soldiered  on 
despite the loss of loved ones. During the year, we also lost a 
few of our colleagues. While we have structured a compensaton 
package for the families of the deceased, no word or action can 
adequately convey our sorrow.

Your Directors would also like to place on record that we did 
not reduce salaries during this trying period. Your Bank paid 
bonuses and increments on time in the year under review and 
followed the normal promotion cycle. It is doing the same this 
year as well.

Mission and Strategic Focus
Your Bank’s mission is to be a ‘World-Class Indian Bank’. Its 
business  philosophy  is  based  on  five  core  values:  Customer 
Focus, Operational Excellence, Product Leadership, People and 
Sustainability.  Sustainability  should  be  viewed  in  unison  with 
Environmental, Social and Governance performance. As a part 
of this, your Bank, through its umbrella CSR brand Parivartan, 
seeks to bring about change in the lives of communities mainly 
in rural India.

During the year under review, the bank did not lose its human 
touch but continued building sound customer franchises across 
distinct  businesses  to  achieve  healthy  growth  in  profitability 
consistent with your Bank’s risk appetite.

In line with the above objective, the Bank aims to take digitalisation 
to the next level to:
(cid:116)(cid:1) Deliver  superior  experience  and  greater  convenience  to 

customers

(cid:116)(cid:1) Increase market share in India’s growing banking and financial 

services industry

(cid:116)(cid:1) Expand geographical reach

(cid:116)(cid:1) Cross-sell the broad financial product portfolio

(cid:116)(cid:1) Sustain strong asset quality through disciplined credit risk 

management

(cid:116)(cid:1) Maintain low cost of funds

Dividend
The RBI, vide notification dated December 4, 2020, stated that in view of the ongoing stress and heightened uncertainty on account 
of COVID-19, banks should continue to conserve capital to support the economy and absorb losses. The notification also stated 
that in order to further strengthen the banks’ balance sheets, while at the same time support lending to the real economy, banks 
shall not make any dividend payment on equity shares from the profits pertaining to the financial year ended March 31, 2020.  
Your Bank did not declare dividend for the financial year ended March 31, 2020.

Given that the current ‘second wave’ has significantly increased the number of COVID-19 cases in India and uncertainty remains, 
the Board of Directors of the Bank, at its meeting held on April 17, 2021, had considered it prudent to not propose dividend for the 
financial year ended March 31, 2021, and decided to re-assess the position based on any further guidelines from the RBI in this 
regard. Subsequently, RBI has, on April 22, 2021 vide its Circular mentioned that banks may pay dividend on equity shares from 
the profits for the financial year ended March 31, 2021, subject to the quantum of dividend being not more than fifty per cent of the 
amount determined as per the dividend payout ratio prescribed in paragraph 4 of the May 4, 2005 circular of RBI. In view of this 
RBI Circular, the Board of Directors of the Bank, at its meeting held on June 18, 2021, has recommended a dividend of ` 6.50 per 
equity share of ` 1/- each, for the financial year ended March 31, 2021. This translates to a Dividend Payout Ratio of 11.5% of the 
profits for the financial year ended March 31, 2021.

In general, your Bank’s dividend policy, among other things, balances the objectives of rewarding shareholders and retaining capital 
to fund future growth. It has a consistent track record of dividend distribution, with the Dividend Payout Ratio ranging between 20 
per cent and 25 per cent, which the Board endeavours to maintain.

The dividend policy of your Bank is available on your Bank’s website: https://v1.hdfcbank.com/htdocs/common/pdf/corporate/

Management Discussion and Analysis
Macroeconomic and Industry Developments
The Indian economy contracted sharply in FY 2020-21 in the 
wake of the global pandemic, with GDP contracting by 7.3 per 
cent in FY 2020-21 as compared to a 4.0 per cent growth in 
FY 2019-20. To recall, the World Health Organization declared 
on March 12, 2020 that the virus is a pandemic. On March 23, 
2020, the Government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown 
for 21 days, which got further extended till May 31, 2020 with 
some relaxations. India enforced one of the strictest lockdowns 
at an early phase of rising cases to limit the spread of the virus. 
Daily COVID-19 cases peaked in September touching a high of 
~98,000 and easing to ~8,600 in early February 2021, due to 
introduction of social distancing norms, localised lockdowns and 
containment measures.

The Government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced 
a host of measures to cushion the direct impact of the lockdown 
on the economy. This helped GDP growth come off its low of 
-24.4 per cent in Q1 and -7.4 per cent in Q2 to +0.5 per cent in 
Q3 and +1.6 per cent in Q4 2020-21. Looking at the internals, 
agriculture  growth  continued  to  remain  positive  (registering  a 
growth of 3.6 per cent in 2020-21) due to the relative insulation of 
the rural sector from the virus. Manufacturing growth contracted 
by 7.2 per cent in 2020-21. However, the sector showed signs 
of recovery in H2 2020-21 - with a contraction of 18.7 per cent 
in  H1  2020-21  but  picked  upto    +  1.6  per  cent  in  Q3  and  + 
6.9 per cent in Q4. Service sector remained a laggard with a 
contraction of 8.4 per cent in 2020-21. Domestic demand began 
to show green shoots in the second half of the year as activity 

resumed. Private consumption indicators such as production 
of consumer durables and non-durables gathered pace in Q3 
along with passenger vehicle (PV) sales that turned green in H2 
FY21. Encouragingly, GST collections rose to ` 1.23 trillion in 
March 2021, averaging ` 1.13 trillion in H2 FY21 as compared to 
an average collection of ` 0.76 trillion in H1 FY21.

The Government announced a stimulus package of ` 20 trillion 
in five different tranches in FY 2020-21 to provide support to  
1) the MSMEs and the NBFCs via a credit guarantee scheme 
and liquidity support 2) migrant labourers via direct spending and 
generating employment via enhanced allocation to MNREGA 
3) small traders, vendors and farmers via loan facilities and 4) 
announced structural reforms across sectors like coal, power, 
agriculture, etc.

On the monetary policy side, the RBI also took a number of steps 
to provide liquidity and enhance credit flow in the system. The 
RBI delivered a total rate cut (repo) of 115 basis points (bps) since 
February 2020, taking the repo rate down to 4.0 per cent. The 
central bank also took a slew of measures to address liquidity 
constraints  such  as  the  announcement  of  the  moratorium, 
liquidity  infusion  through  TLTRO  (Targeted  Long  Term  Repo 
Operations) for NBFCs (` 500 billion), liquidity facility of ` 500 
billion for mutual funds, liquidity support of ` 500 billion for all 
India financial institutions and a cut in the CRR (Cash Reserve 
Ratio) by 100 bps to 3 per cent. These measures helped anchor 
borrowing  costs  in  the  economy,  support  credit  growth  and 
cushioned the impact of the disruptions in the financial market.

Looking at the inflation side, CPI inflation averaged 6.7 per cent in 
H1 FY21 mainly due to higher food prices on account of COVID-
led supply disruptions. Inflation eased below RBI’s upper band 
of 6.0 per cent from December 2020 to February 2021. In FY 
2020-21,  the  headline  inflation  averaged  6.2  per  cent,  above 
the RBI’s target range of 4 +/-2 per cent. In FY 2021-22, CPI 
inflation  rose  to  6.3  per  cent  in  May-21  from  4.2  per  cent  in 
Apr-21, breaching the RBI’s upper threshold of 6 per cent for 
the  first  time  in  six  months.  Apart  from  higher  fuel  and  food 
inflation, a large part of this increase was driven by higher core 
inflation, possibly reflecting the impact of second wave related 
supply disruptions and a pass through of cost push pressures. 
Going forward, we expect inflation to remain above 6 per cent 
for the next 3 months. For FY 2021-22, we expect the headline 
inflation to average 6.1% led by higher commodity prices and 
sticky core inflation.

On the policy front, we expect the central bank to keep its rates 
unchanged  in  FY  2021-22  and  maintain  an  accommodative 
stance. The RBI is likely to only gradually reduce the liquidity 
surplus in the system once it is confident about the prospects of 
growth recovery. The central bank is likely to continue managing 
the yield curve, especially the benchmark yield through open 
market  operations  (sterilised  and  unsterilsed)  and  the  latest 
announced G-SAP bond buying programme in order to contain 
borrowing costs in the economy and improve transmission.

Introduction to 

Our 

On the policy front, we expect the central 

bank to keep its rates unchanged in FY 2021-

22 and maintain an accommodative stance.

In the financial sector, the onset of COVID-19 weighed down 

on  credit  growth  while  the  deposit  growth  remained  robust. 

In FY 2020-21, the credit growth averaged at 5.9 per cent as 

compared to 9.5 per cent y-o-y in FY 2019-20. A sharp slowdown 

in economic activity as reflected by a 7.3 per cent contraction in 

GDP weighed on credit demand. On the flip side, deposit growth 

improved to 10.9 per cent in FY 2020-21 from 9.9 per cent in FY 

2019-20. The improvement in deposit growth could be reflecting 

pandemic related saving tendency among individuals. In Apr-

21, while credit growth came in at 5.7 per cent, deposit growth 

tracked at 10.3 per cent.

Looking at the credit sectoral level, the weakness was recorded 

in the industry sector (large industries) while credit deployment 

to personal loans and to services sector rose albeit at a slower 

pace. As per the RBI’s January 2021 Financial Stability Report, 

the GNPA ratio of scheduled commercial banks eased to 7.5 

per cent in September 2020 from 9.3 per cent in September 

2019. That said, the central bank estimates the ratio to increase 

to 13.5 per cent by September 2021. The GNPA could escalate 

to 14.8 per cent if the macroeconomic environment worsens 

into a severe stress scenario. Heading into FY 2021-22, credit 

growth  outlook  is  expected  to  improve  amid  improvement  in 

GDP growth and as liquidity remains comfortable.

Vehicles (SPVs) in which the Government had initially taken an 

equity stake. Thus, for instance, the targeted credit flow of ` 300 

billion in the form of collateral free loans to the smaller MSMEs 

was backed by a 100 per cent Government of India guarantee 

given  through  National  Credit  Guarantee  Trustee  Company 

(NCGTC). Other measures included creating a fund of funds for 

MSMEs, PCGS for NBFCs/MFIs and providing subordinate debt 

for stressed MSMEs through a Credit Guarantee Fund Trust.

The  direct  fiscal  spending  component  (on  MNREGA,  EPF 

support for business and workers, foodgrain supply for migrant 

workers  and  enhancing  micro  food  enterprises  among  other 

things) is relatively low and stands at ` 2 trillion or 1 per cent of 

GDP. Instead, the broad strategy of the stimulus is to remove 

bottlenecks  on  the  supply  side  for  the  smaller  and  labour-

intensive  firms  to  set  off  a  ‘virtuous  cycle’  of  more  viable 

operations, increased production and employment, and higher 

incomes that would translate into enhanced demand.

supply side for the smaller and labour-

intensive firms to set off a ‘virtuous cycle’ 

of more viable operations, increased 

production and employment, and higher 

incomes that would translate into enhanced 

demand.

For the financial sector, the Government announced the Partial

of  COVID-19.  This  made  them  particularly  vulnerable  to  the 

additional outlay of ` 102 billion towards industrial expenditure, 

lockdown and its aftermath. The NBFC sector, a major provider 

industrial incentives and development of defence equipment.

of funding to the MSMEs had also been going through a period 

of stress, particularly in its access to finances both from banks 

and  the  market.  Thus,  the  stimulus  package  focused  on  the 

survival of both MSMEs and NBFCs through the COVID-19 crisis 

and also their revival. The critical element of the stimulus was 

its attempt to facilitate the flow of credit to both MSMEs directly 

and to NBFCs. The Government aimed to do this by reducing 

the risk taken by banks and other institutions in lending to them 

by providing explicit guarantees either on the entire loan or a 

fraction. The guarantees delivered were through Special Purpose 

From  the  Government  side,  trend  in  capex  has  also  been 

encouraging.  In  FY  2020-21,  the  Government  has  spent  INR 

4.3 trillion on capex, which is a 26.5 per cent y-o-y increase from  

FY 2019-20. For the ongoing fiscal year, the Government has 

budgeted capex at an 18 year high of 2.5 per cent of GDP. In INR 

terms, FY 2021-22 capex is budgeted at INR 5.3 trillion, which 

marks an increase of 30.5 per cent from the last year.

In fiscal 2020-21, while export demand dipped by 7.2 per cent, 

imports  shrank  17.6  per  cent,  reflecting  pandemic  related

disruptions.  However,  trend  in  services  trade  balance  was 
encouraging.  Services  trade  balance  improved  to  USD  85.1 
Billion from USD 80 Billion in FY 2019-20. Taking these factors 
into account, we expect current account to record a surplus of 
1.0 per cent of GDP in FY 2020-21 vs a deficit of 0.9 per cent in 
FY 2019-20. However, on a quarterly basis, we expect current 
account to record a deficit of 0.7 per cent in Q4 FY20-21. Foreign 
flows remained strong in FY 2020-21 despite initial jitters in the 
market. While gross FDI flows improved to USD 81.7 Billlion in 
FY 2020-21 as compared to 74.4 Billlion in FY 2019-20, FII flows 
recorded a net inflow of USD 30.3 Billlion vs. a net outflow of 
USD 5.1 Billion  in the previous year. With robust capital flows 
and a surplus in the capital account, we expect BoP surplus to 
improve to a record high of USD 100 Billlion in FY 2020-21. Going 
ahead, with improvement in domestic demand conditions and 
higher commodity prices, we expect current account to record 
a deficit of 1.8 per cent of GDP in FY 2021-22. 

As  India  emerges  from  the  impact  of  the  pandemic  in  2021, 
it is expected to be one of the fastest growing economies in 
the world in FY 2021-22 with GDP growth expected to rise by 
9.1  per  cent  in  real  terms.  We  expect  the  economy  to  reach 
its pre-pandemic output level (2019) by the end of the current 
fiscal  year.  Growth  is  likely  to  be  supported  by  higher  capex 
spending  by  the  Government,  recovery  in  domestic  demand 
and continued monetary policy support from the RBI. For the 
next fiscal year, the pandemic situation and vaccination drive 
are critical factors for the pace of economic recovery. In the near 
term, the second wave of COVID  is likely to weigh on the pace of 
recovery in Q1 FY2021-22. However, as the economy begins to 
open up, we expect recovery to pick up pace in Q2 FY2021-22 
with support from both fiscal spending and continued monetary 
accommodation.

Financial Performance
The financial performance of your Bank during the year ended 
March  31,  2021,  remained  healthy  with  Total  Net  Revenue 
(Net  Interest  Income  plus  Other  Income)  rising  13.4  per  cent 
to ` 90,084.5 crore from ` 79,447.1 crore in the previous year. 
Revenue growth was driven by an increase in both Net Interest 
Income and Other Income. Net Interest Income grew by 15.5 
per cent to ` 64,879.6 crore due to acceleration in loan growth 
coupled with a Net Interest Margin (NIM) of 4.1 per cent.

Other Income grew by 8.4 per cent to  ` 25,204.9 crore. The 
largest component was Fees and Commissions at ` 16,169.3 
crore.  Gain  on  Revaluation  and  Sale  of  Investments  was 
` 3,867.0 crore. Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Revenue was 
` 2,438.4 crore, and recoveries from written-off accounts were 
` 2,148.4 crore. Consequent to the outbreak of the COVID-19 
pandemic, the Indian Government announced a lockdown  in 
March  2020.  Subsequently,  the  national  lockdown  was  lifted 
by  the  Government,  but  regional  lockdowns  continue  to  be 
implemented in  areas with  a significant number  of COVID-19 
cases. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in customer 
behaviour  and  pandemic  fears,  as  well  as  restrictions  on 
business and individual activities, have led to significant volatility 
in global and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease 
in global and local economic activities. The slowdown during 
the year led to a decrease in loan originations, the sale of third 
party products, the use of credit and debit cards by customers 
and the efficiency in collection efforts. This may lead to a rise 
in  the  number  of  customer  defaults  and  consequently,  an 
increase  in  provisions  there  against.  The  extent  to  which  the 
COVID-19 pandemic, including the current second wave that has 
significantly increased the number of cases in India, will continue 
to  impact  the  Bank’s  results  will  depend  on  ongoing  as  well 
as future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, 
among other things, any new information concerning the severity 
of the COVID-19 pandemic and any action to contain its spread 
or mitigate its impact whether Government-mandated or elected 
by us.

Operating  (Non-Interest)  Expenses  rose  to  `  32,722.6  crore 
from ` 30,697.5 crore. During the year, your Bank set up 354 
new branches and 1,186 ATMs / Cash Deposit and Withdrawal 
Machines (CDMs). This, along with higher spend on IT, resulted in 
higher infrastructure and staffing expenses. Staff expenses also 
went up due to employee additions and annual wage revisions. 
Further, Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 
(DICGC) premium cost increased due to deposit growth and 
rate increase. Despite higher staff and infrastructure expenses, 
the  Cost  to  Income  Ratio  improved  to  36.3  per  cent  from  
38.6 per cent.

financial year included credit reserves relating to the coronavirus 
pandemic in the form of contingent provisions of approximately 
` 1,300.0 crore.

The Coverage Ratio based on specific provisions alone excluding 
write-offs was 69.8 per cent and including General and Floating 
provisions  it  was  115  per  cent.  Your  Bank  made  General 
Provisions of ` 867.0 crore during the year. Gross Non Performing 
Assets (GNPAs) were at 1.32 per cent of Gross Advances, as 
against 1.26 per cent in the previous year. Net NPA ratio stood 
at 0.40 per cent as against 0.36 per cent in the previous year.

In  accordance  with  the  COVID-19  regulatory  packages 
announced by the RBI on March 27, 2020, April 17, 2020 and 
May 23, 2020, your Bank, in accordance with its Board approved 
policy, offered a moratorium on the repayment of all instalments 
and / or interest, as applicable, due between March 1, 2020 and 
August 31, 2020 to all eligible borrowers classified as standard, 
even if overdue, as on February 29, 2020. In respect of such 
accounts that were granted moratorium, the asset classification 
remained standstill during the moratorium period. Your Bank has 
made provisions above the RBI prescribed requirements against 
the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic (based on the 
information available at this point in time).

Business Review
Your Bank’s operations are split into Domestic and International.

A) Domestic Business comprises the following:
Retail Banking
The  Retail  Business  operated  under  extremely  challenging 
circumstances in the year under review. This business is directly 
linked to consumption, which slowed down during the lockdown. 
As the unlock gathered momentum, the business recovered and 
with domestic advances rising 6.7 per cent.

Domestic Retail Deposits grew by 21.1 per cent to ` 1,064,684 
crore from ` 879,145 crore in the preceding year, while Retail 
Advances rose 6.7 per cent to ` 527,586 crore from ` 494,401 
crore.

Your Bank continues to be a leader in the auto loans segment 
with  strong  presence  in  passenger,  commercial  vehicle  and 
two-wheeler  financing.  The  first  two  quarters  were  impacted 
by the lockdown but growth revived in the third quarter and the 
momentum  continued  in  the  fourth.  This  enabled  your  Bank 
to  close  the  year  at  pre-pandemic  levels.  While  there  was  a 
marginal uptick in ticket size in the fourth quarter, growth came 
largely on the back of improved distribution.

Profit Before Tax grew by 13.8 per cent to ` 41,659.0 crore. After 
providing for Income Tax of ` 10,542.5 crore, Net Profit increased 
by 18.5 per cent to ` 31,116.5 crore from ` 26,257.3 crore. Return 
on Average Net Worth was 16.60 per cent while Basic Earnings 
Per Share was ` 56.58 up from ` 48.01.

The Personal Loan Business is also surging back to pre-COVID 
levels, and ended the year  at  ` 118,000 crore. About 80 per 
cent of the incremental loans were to employees of top rated 
corporates with reasonably high disposable income. In the year 
under review, the portfolio further improved qualitatively, which 
is indicated by an increase in credit scores across segments.

As on March 31, 2021, your Bank’s Total Balance Sheet stood at 
` 1,746,871 crore, an increase of 14.1 per cent over `1,530,511 
crore on March 31, 2020. Total Deposits rose by 16.3 per cent 
to ` 1,335,060 crore from ` 1,147,502 crore. Savings Account 
Deposits grew by 30.0 per cent to ` 403,500 crore while Current 
Account Deposits rose by 21.8 per cent to ` 212,182 crore. Time 
Deposits stood at ` 719,378 crore, representing an increase of 
8.5 per cent. CASA Deposits accounted for 46.1 per cent of Total 
deposits. Advances stood at ` 1,132,837 crore an increase of 
14.0 per cent. Domestic Loan Portfolio of ` 1,111,510 crore grew 
by 14.1 per cent over March 31, 2020.

Increase in FY 2020-21

Your  Bank  also  continues  to  drive  value  through  its  digital 
platforms, increasing penetration in its internal customer base. 
Digitalisation also plays a key role for your Bank in pioneering 
various digital loans - 10 second Personal Loan, Digital Loan 
Against  Shares  and  Loan  Against  Mutual  Funds.  There  is 
also  increased  focus  in  digitisiting  processes  and  customer 
touchpoints to better your Bank’s reach to customers across 
products.

The  Payments  Business,  where  your  Bank  has  a  dominant 
presence not only acts as a catalyst for cashless transactions 
but also spurs consumption. With 3.67 crore debit cards, 1.49 
crore credit cards and about 21.34 lakh acceptance points, it 
is  among  the  largest  facilitators  of  cashless  payments  in  the 
country. Your Bank’s payments business has launched digital 
offerings such as Bharat QR Code, UPI, and SMS pay solutions. 
It has also pioneered products such as the SmartHub app for 
small  merchants  and  DigiPos,  which  enables  traditional  PoS 
machines to accept digital payments.

With 3.67 crore debit cards, 1.49 crore 
credit cards and about 21.34 lakh

largest facilitators of cashless payments in 
the country.

In  the  credit  card  business,  the  RBI,  through  its  order  dated 
December 2, 2020, advised your Bank against sourcing new 
credit card customers. Your Bank subsequently recalibrated its 
strategy and began selling more to existing customers of the 
Bank. Credit cards constitute about 6 per cent of the overall 
Bank book.

The Virtual Relationship Management (VRM) programme gained 
traction  during  the  year  under  review.  Digital  or  conctacless 
banking  has  become  a  necessity  in  the  pandemic.    Under 
VRM, Relationship Managers reach out to customers through 
remote  and  digital  platforms,  leading  to  deeper  engagement 
in  a  cost-effective  manner.  As  digital  literacy  and  exposure 
increases  exponentially,  VRM  is  gaining  acceptance  through 
wider engagement, deeper relationships and a complete suite 
of products to offer. A banking experience with digital ease and 
personalized conversations is at the core of our VRM strategy.  
The Virtual Relationship Management practice is an integrated 
customer  centric  approach  covering  three  pillars  –Virtual 
Relationships, Virtual Sales and Virtual Care.

Meanwhile,  your  Bank  also  added  354  branches  during  the 
year, taking the total to 5,608 across 2,902 cities / towns. The 
share of semi-urban and rural outlets in the network is 50 per 
cent, reflecting our continued focus on penetrating further into 
these  markets.  In  addition,  your  Bank  has  15,756  business 
correspondents  primarily  managed  by  the  Common  Service 
Centres. The number of ATMs / CDMs also increased to 16,087 
from 14,901. The total number of customers your Bank catered 
to as on March 31, 2021 was over 6.18 crore, up from over 5.60 
crore in the previous year.

As you are aware, your Bank operates in the Home Loan Business 
in conjunction with HDFC Limited. As per this arrangement, your 
Bank  sells  HDFC  home  loans  while  HDFC  Limited  approves 
and disburses them. Your Bank receives sourcing fee for these 
loans and, as per the arrangement, has the option to purchase 
up  to  70  per  cent  of  fully-disbursed  loans  either  through  the 
issuance of mortgage-backed Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) 
or a direct assignment of loans. The balance is retained by HDFC 
Limited. The year under review saw a 62 per cent rise over the 
previous year in home loans. The increase in demand coupled 
with the SOPs in Maharashtra aided the growth in Q4. Your Bank 
originated, on an average, ` 2,470 crore of home loans every 

132

month in the year under review and purchased ` 18,980 crore 
as direct assignment of loans.

Third Party Products
Your Bank distributes Life, General and Health Insurance, and 
Mutual Funds (third party products). Income from this business 
grew by 27 per cent to ` 3,573 crore from ` 2,817 crore and 
accounted for 22 per cent of Total Fee Income in the year ended 
March 31, 2021 compared with 17 per cent in the preceding year.

Insurance
The  open  architecture  adopted  by  your  Bank  for  insurance 
distribution  with  eight  insurers  was  made  more  robust  by 
leveraging more branches and expanding the product bouquet. 
Continuing  with  the  digital  focus,  straight  through  process 
from prospecting to proposal stage was introduced with real 
time integration across all insurers. Premium mobilisation in life 
Insurance for the year ended March 31, 2021 was ` 5,888 crore.

In  the  Non-Life  insurance  space,  your  Bank,  along  with  its 
Insurance  partners,  introduced  new  and  innovative  products 
and increased customer offerings. All the products offered are 
enabled through Netbanking and telesales platforms. Employees 
across channels have been trained on the new products and 
processes. Manpower has been strengthened across Non-Life 
insurers to increase our business in the non-motor insurance 
space. Premium mobilisation in General and Health Insurance 
grew by 13 per cent over the year earlier to ` 2,230 crore.

Retail Advances
6.7 per cent  
Growth in FY 2020-21

Wholesale Banking
The  Wholesale  Banking  business  was  a  key  growth  engine 
for your Bank in the year under review. This business focuses 
on institutional customers such as the Government, large and 
emerging corporates, and SMEs. Your Bank’s strong offerings 
include working capital and term loans, as well as trade credit, 
cash management, supply chain financing, foreign exchange, 
and investment banking services.

The  Wholesale  Banking  business  recorded  healthy  growth, 
ending  FY  2020-21  with  a  domestic  loan  book  size  of  over 
` 583,925 crore, recording a growth of 21.7 per cent over the 
year earlier. This constituted about 53 per cent of your Bank’s 
domestic  loans  as  per  Basel  II  classification.  Your  Bank  was 
able to expand its share of the customer wallet, primarily using 
sharper customisation, cross-selling and expanding into greater 
geographies. And continuing to lend during the pandemic while 
being prudent.

earlier. This was thanks to your Bank’s focused outreach 

to large corporates and well-rated/blue chip PSUs at the 

outset of the pandemic to offer them liquidity. It was able 

to do so as it was armed with sufficient cash due to its 

strong  capital  base  and  balance  sheet.  Also,  post  the 

TLTRO scheme under which banks could access long-term 

debt from the RBI at the repo rate, this only got reinforced. 

As  per  the  guidelines  of  the  TLTRO  scheme,  your  Bank 

deployed this money in designated sectors like agriculture, 

agri-infrastructure,  secured  retail,  MSMEs,  and  drugs, 

pharmaceuticals and healthcare.

This business also continued to capitalise on the trend of 

large companies preferring to deal with fewer banks. Your 

Bank deepened its existing relationships as well as gained 

market share by leveraging its wide product offering. The 

Emerging Corporates Group, which focuses on the mid-

market segment, too witnessed significant growth. Your 

Bank  leveraged  its  vast  geographical  reach,  technology 

backbone, automated processes, suite of financial products 

and quick turnaround times to offer a differentiated service, 

which has resulted in new customer acquisitions as well as 

a higher share of the wallet from existing customers. The 

business continues to have a diversified portfolio in terms 

of both industry and geography.

In  the  year  under  review,  the  Bank  continued  its  focus 

on the MSME sector. There has already been increased 

formalisation of the MSME sector due to the adoption of 

the Goods and Service Tax (GST). The COVID-19 pandemic 

led to the sector experiencing substantial stress, prompting 

the Union Government to announce the Emergency Credit 

Line Guaratee Scheme (ECLGS), under which your Bank 

emerged as a star performer in disbursing credit.

In  the  Government  business,  your  Bank  sustained 

its  focus  on  tax  collections,  collecting  direct  tax  of 

` 302,823.78 crore and indirect tax of over ` 1,65,741.27 crore  

during  FY 2020-21. It continues to enjoy a pre-eminent 

position among the country’s major stock and commodity 

exchanges in both Cash Management Services and Cash 

Settlement Services.

Your Bank has been a pioneer in providing Digital Banking 

Services  to  its  wholesale  banking  customers.  It  was  an 

early adopter of digital technology through the Corporate 

Net Banking Platform, ENet.

Your  Bank  offers  the  entire  gamut  of  financial  services, 

such as payments, collection, tax solutions, Government 

business,  trade  finance  services,  cash  management 

solutions and corporate cards through its flagship platform, 

besides seamlessly connecting its customers through API,

ranked 2nd in the Bloomberg rankings of 

Rupee Bond Book Runners for FY 2020-

from 13.72%.

Treasury

The Treasury is the custodian of your Bank’s cash/liquid 

assets and handles its investments in securities, foreign 

exchange and cash instruments. It manages the liquidity 

and  interest  rate  risks  on  the  balance  sheet  and  is  also 

responsible for meeting reserve requirements. The vertical 

also helps manage the treasury needs of customers and 

earns a fee income generated from transactions customers 

undertake  with  your  Bank  while  managing  their  foreign 

exchange and interest rate risks.

Revenue accrues from spreads on customer transactions 

based on trade and remittance flows and demonstrated 

hedging needs. Your Bank recorded revenue of ` 2,438.4 

crore from foreign exchange and derivative transactions 

in the year under review. While plain vanilla forex products 

were in demand across all customer segments, demand 

for  derivatives  products  increased  with  RBI  liberalising

regulations and allowing Indian banks to participate in Non-
Deliverable Offshore markets.

As part of its prudent risk management, your Bank enters into 
foreign exchange and derivatives deals with counterparties 
after  it  has  set  up  appropriate  credit  limits  based  on  its 
evaluation  of  the  ability  of  the  counterparty  to  meet  its 
obligations. Where your Bank enters into foreign currency 
derivatives contracts not involving the Indian Rupee with 
its  customers,  it  typically  lays  them  off  in  the  inter-bank 
market  on  a  matched  basis.  For  such  foreign  currency 
derivatives, your Bank primarily carries the counterparty 
credit risk (where the customer has crystallised payables or 
mark-to-market losses) and may carry only residual market 
risk, if any. Your Bank also deals in derivatives on its own 
account, including for the purpose of its own Balance Sheet 
risk management.

Your Bank maintains a portfolio of Government Securities, 
in line with the regulatory norms governing the Statutory 
Liquidity  Ratio  (SLR).  A  significant  portion  of  these  SLR 
securities  are  ‘Held-to-Maturity’  (HTM)  category,  while 
some  are  ‘Available  for  Sale’  (AFS).  Your  Bank  is  also  a 
primary dealer for Government Securities. As a part of this 
business, your Bank holds fixed income securities as ‘Held 
for Trading’ (HFT).

In  the  year  under  review,  your  Bank  continued  to  be  a 
significant participant in the domestic exchange and interest 
rate markets. It also capitalised on falling bond yields to 
book profits and is now looking at tapping opportunities 
arising out of the liberalisation in the foreign exchange and 
interest rate markets.

International Business
To address the needs of NRI clients and Indian corporates,
your Bank has opened branches and representative offices 
in Manama (Bahrain), Hong Kong, Dubai, DIFC, Abu Dhabi
and Nairobi (Kenya). These offices increase awareness of
your Bank’s brand with existing and prospective clients.
It  also  has  a  presence  in  International  Financial  Service
Centre (IFSC) at GIFT City in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. This
unit was opened four years ago. Your Bank offers products 
such as trade credits, foreign currency term loans including 
External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) and derivatives to
hedge loans. As on March 31, 2021, the Balance Sheet size 
of the international business was US$ 6 billion. Advances
constituted 2.78 per cent of your Bank’s Gross Advances.
The  Total  Income  of  the  overseas  branches  constituted
0.64 per cent of the Bank’s Total Income for the year. The
numbers may appear small, but what is significant here is
your Bank’s ability to cater to a large and growing Indian
diaspora and maintain its leadership position among the
peer group.

C) Partnering with the Government

1) CSC Partnership

Your  Bank  has  been  closely  working  with  the
Government  both  at  the  central  and  state  levels.  It
has an equity investment of over 6.5 per cent in CSC
e-Governance  Services  India  Ltd.  CSCs,  operated
by Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs), are the access
points  for  the  delivery  of  essential  public  utility
services, social welfare schemes, healthcare, financial, 
education and agriculture services, apart from a host
of B2C services to citizens in rural and remote areas
of the country. It is a pan-India network facilitating the
Government’s mandate of a socially, financially and
digitally  inclusive  society.  The  Government  of  India
envisages at least one VLE per 2.54 gram panchayat.
Your bank will use this network to offer retail products
and  banking  services  and  further  contribute  to  the
Government’s ‘Digital India’ initiative.

During the year under review, your Bank considerably
strengthened its relationship with CSCs by empanelling 
an additional 10,000 plus Business Correspondents
taking the number of such correspondents to 15,756.

2) Start-Up Fund and SmartUp Banking

Under  its  SmartUp  Banking  Programme  for  Start-
ups,  your  bank  crossed  the  milestone  of  16,000
such  businesses.  It  is  working  with  various  state
governments and incubators/accelerators to promote
entrepreneurship. MoUs have already been signed with 
five state governments and Ministry of Electronics and 
Information Technology (MeitY) to enable execution of
the varied aspects of their respective start-up policies. 
Your Bank also works with 20+ incubators certified by
the Department of Science and Technology, including 
various  Indian  Institutes  of  Technology  and  Indian
Institutes  of  Management.  This  year  we  extended
financial  and  advisory  support  to  21  social  impact
start-ups in the Ed-tech and skill development sectors. 
We are also causing connects through initiatives like
HNI  meets  along  with  our  partners  and  mentoring

D) Semi-Urban and Rural

The Semi Urban and Rural markets have always been a
focus of your Bank’s strategy. In the last few years, your
Bank has made a renewed push into the semi-urban and
rural  markets  as  rising  income  levels  and  aspirations  of
rural customers are leading to demand for better quality
financial products and services. The rural groups in every
department  of  your  Bank  work  together  to  tap  these
opportunities.

Apart  from  meeting  its  statutory  obligations  under  PSL,
your Bank has been offering a wide range of products on
the asset side, such as auto, two-wheeler, personal, gold,
Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV), small shopkeeper loans
in these markets. Now, it plans to increase its coverage of
villages and deepen relationships in existing ones. The semi 
urban and rural push has  been backed by the bank’s digital 
strategy.

Your Bank’s operations in Semi Urban and Rural locations are 
explained below:

Agriculture and Allied Activities
Yours  Bank’s  advances  to  Agriculture  &  Allied  activities  rose 
by  10.92  per  cent  to  `  94,977.14  crore  for  the  year  ended  
March 31, 2021.

The importance of this segment can be understood from the 
fact  that  about  60  per  cent  of  the  population  is  dependent 
on agriculture for livelihood. In the year of the pandemic, the 
Bank disbursed about ` 2,000 crore in line with Government 
regulations which benefited over 1.42 lakh farmers.

1.42 lakh  
Farmers benefited in the pandemic year

The rural economy which primarily depends on agriculture was 
largely insulated from the pandemic. Post July there was month 
on month growth in tractor sales thanks to a good monsoon and 
healthy cash flow. In FY 2020-21, the domestic tractor industry 
grew 25 per cent in terms of units sold on a YoY basis. HDFC 
Bank Tractor Loans registered a growth of 55% in FY 2020-21 
in terms of no. of units financed. The size of the book has grown 
30 per cent YoY crossing ` 5,000 crore.

In general the key to your Bank’s success in this market has been 
its ability to tap the opportunities through:

- Wide product range

- Faster turnaround time

- Digital solutions

The Bank’s product range includes pre-and post-harvest crop 
loans, two-wheeler loans, auto loans, tractor loans, small agri 
business loans, loan against gold, among others. This has helped 
the Bank establish a strong footprint in the rural hinterland with 
its asset products. Apart from advising farmers on their financial 
needs, your Bank is increasingly focusing on facilitating various 
Government/regulatory  schemes  such  as  crop  insurance, 
Government  subsidy  /  crore  guarantee  schemes,  interest 
subvention etc.

The Bank has designed a range of crop and geography-specific 
products in line with the harvest cycles and the local needs of 
farmers across diverse agro-climatic zones. It has transformed 
rural banking services from being product centric to customer 
centric.

Products  such  as  post-harvest  cash  credit  and  warehouse 
receipt  financing  enable  faster  cash  flows  to  farmers.  Credit 
is  also  offered  for  allied  agricultural  activities  such  as  dairy, 
pisciculture, and sericulture.

Your  Bank’s  focus  in  the  rural  markets  has  not  just  been  on 
increasing credit offtake, but also on cementing relationships 
with customers by empowering them. As part of these efforts, 
farmer centers or Kisan Dhan Vikas Kendras have been rolled out 
in Punjab, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. At 
these centers, farmers access information on soil health, mandi 
prices,  and  various  Government  initiatives  and  also  receive 
expert advice. These services are also available on the Bank’s 
website in vernacular languages. Kisan Dhan Vikas e-Kendra is 
one of its kind in the Banking Industry to reach out to the farmers 
as one stop solution for all their requirements viz. loan eligibility, 
online application facility, training though kiosks, call an expert 
facility,  soil testing  and  much more. Your Bank also provides 
advisory on weather, cropping and harvesting through SMS.

In line with this, the Bank also launched the e-KISAN Dhan app, 
a unique digital app for the Rural/farming community. This is 
an  exclusive  mobile  App  for  all  rural  banking  and  agriculture 
information needs from HDFC Bank.

This app aggregates crucial information required by the farmers.  
There have been about 97,000 downloads of the app.

Multiple needs of the farmers can be serviced such as shopping 
of seeds, agro products, information on best practices, weather 
alerts,  mandi  rates,  expert  advice,  Agri  news,  information  on 
Government  schemes  like  debt  waiver,  interest  subvention, 
crop insurance, godown and livestock centre amongst others. 
Another important initiative this year has been the launch of the 
‘KGC-Shaurya for the Armed forces personnel/Ex-Servicemen 
engaged in farming.

This product program offers a hassle free transaction for the 
defence personnel, so that they can avail farming loans under 
Kisan Gold Card (based on the KCC guidelines of Government).

Directors’ Report

KGC  Shaurya  weaves  a  smooth  process  of  addressing  the 
farming  requirements  of  defence  personnel  under  various 
scenarios  where  loan  processes  are  executed  even  if  the 
concerned person is on deputation and is unable to be physically 
present for verification. The target customers are from the Army, 
Navy and Air Force, Personnel of Para Military Forces like BSF, 
ITBP, CRPF, Coastal Guards, CISF and Assam/J&K Rifles owning 
agricultural lands either in their own names or the names of their 
family members.

Digitising Milk Procurement: This initiative brings transparency 
in the milk procurement and payment process, which benefits 
both farmers and dairy societies. Multi-function Terminals (MFTs), 
popularly known as Milk-to-Money ATMs, are deployed in dairy 
societies. The MFTs link the milk procurement system of the dairy 
society to the farmer’s account to enable faster payments. MFTs 
have cash dispensers that function as standard ATMs. Payments 
are credited without the hassles of cash distribution. Further, 
this process creates a credit history which can then be used 
for accessing bank credit. Apart from dairy and cattle loans, 
customers  gain  access  to  all  the  Bank’s  products  including 
digital offerings such as 10 Second Personal Loans, Kisan Credit 
Card, Bill Pay, and Missed Call Mobile Recharge. So far, your 
Bank has digitized payments at over 1,315 milk co-operatives 
across 21 states, benefiting more than 5.08 lakh dairy farmers.

The Dairy business as a whole witnessed a 46 per cent year 
on year growth in disbursements and 54 per cent in the book.

Substituting  Moneylenders:  Your  Bank  is  slowly  making 
inroads into a market traditionally dominated by the unorganized 
sector, moneylenders and pawn brokers. Loans against gold 
jewellery grew by over 33 per cent to about ` 8,300 crore in 
FY 2020-21 from over 6,200 crore in FY 2019-20. The entry of 
organized players has increased awareness and transparency. 
The availability of the asset and the ease of securing a loan have 
made this a convenient and viable credit option. 

In FY 2020-21, your Bank added 225 more branches, taking the 
total number to 1,000 through which gold loans are distributed. 

Social initiatives in Farm Sector: Farm yield and income are 
subject to the vagaries of the weather. In addition, factors like 
soil health, input quality (seeds and fertilizers), water availability, 
and Government policy have significant impact, along with price 
realizations  and  storage  facilities.  Your  Bank  has  launched  a 
variety of initiatives to ease the stress on farm income and rural 
households.

Over  the  last  few  years,  several  parts  of  the  country  have 
been severely impacted by natural calamities such as drought, 
unseasonal rains, hailstorms, floods and the pandemic. Within 
regulatory guidelines, your Bank has been providing relief to the 
impacted farmers. It also has put in place systems designed to 
enable direct benefit transfers in a time-bound manner.

Lending to the agriculture sector, including to small and marginal 
farmers, is a regulatory mandate as part of priority sector lending 
requirements.  This  segment  has  inherent  credit  risks.  Your 
bank has taken various initiatives to navigate the changing agri-
lending trend. It has also taken steps pertaining to delinquency 
management like root-cause analysis of critical locations, close 
monitoring of delinquency, prioritisation-based recovery strategy, 
system  automations.  The  Bank  has  leveraged  its  extensive 
knowledge  of  rural  customers  to  create  as  well  as  deliver 
products and services at affordable price points and with quick 
turnaround time. This has enabled the Bank to establish a strong 
footprint in the rural geographies, which it has now leveraged to 
increase its penetration of liability products. Further, your Bank is 
building a segment-specific approach like funding to horticulture 
clusters, supply chain finance, agribusiness, MSMEs and dairy 
farmers.  It  also  continues  to  engage  closely  with  farmers  to 
mitigate risks and protect portfolio quality.

Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME)
The MSME sector serves as an important engine for economic 
growth  and  is  one  of  the  largest  employers  in  the  economy. 
Advances to the MSME and Trader and Wholesaler segment 
as  on  March  31,  2021  stood  at  `  2,01,833  crore  as  against 
` 1,59,107.93 crore a year ago. Your Bank’s advances to the 
Micro Enterprises alone stood at ` 60,846.03 crore.

The MSME sector was one of the sectors identified for special 
support by the Government and the RBI during the pandemic 
through various schemes.

Your Bank has ensured support for its customers through these 
schemes.  Be  it helping them avail of the interest moratorium 
or the Funded Interest Term Loans. And above all, loans under 
ECLGS  Scheme.  On  the  interest  and  principal  moratorium  1 
and  2  schemes,  your  Bank  ensured  complete  coverage  of 
this  scheme  to  its  existing  customers  as  per  the  terms  and 
conditions announced by the Government. Digital applications 
were accepted through the Bank’s website and straight through 
processing was done to smoothen the process and ensure faster 
delivery. Your Bank also emerged as a star performer under the 
ECLGS 1.0 and 2.0 schemes. It disbursed loans amounting to 
` 29,622 crore to over 1.23 lakh customers. This swift support 
enabled existing customers to meet their operational liabilities 
and helped in the smooth functioning of their businesses.

ECLGS schemes - loan disbursements
` 29,622 crore   
Over 1.23 lakh customers

The silver lining has been that the pace of digitisation among 
MSMEs has gained further momentum. This will not only help 
the pace of disbursement but also increase transparency in the 
sector. The process started with Government’s digitisation push 
and the adoption of GST, which resulted in easy availability of 
data for banks regarding cash flows of these companies.

The  SME  portal  continues  to  offer  ad  hoc  approvals,  

pre-approved  TODs  on  an  STP  basis  to  existing  customers. 

They  can  request  top-up  of  loans  and  submit  the  required 

documents online. The SME portal also helps customers access 

your Bank’s services related to sanctioned credit facilities 24/7 

from anywhere.

On  the  trade  side,  your  Bank’s  focus  has  been  on  customer 

engagement  for  increasing  the  penetration  of  Trade  on  Net 

applications.  This  is  a  complete  enterprise  trade  solution  for 

customers engaged in domestic as well as foreign trade, enabling 

them  to  initiate  online  requests  and  track  them  seamlessly, 

resulting in reduced time and costs.

Taking Banking to the Unbanked

Your Bank is fully committed to taking banking to the remotest 

parts  of  the  country  through  a  combination  of  an  extensive 

physical  network  and  a  robust  digital  suite  of  products  and 

services. Today, about half of your Bank’s outlets are located 

in rural and semi-urban areas. Your Bank also offers last mile 

access through mobile applications such as BHIM, UPI, USSD, 

Scan and Pay, and RuPay enabled Micro-ATMs.

To  bring  more  under-banked  sections  of  the  population  into 

formal financial channels, your Bank has opened over 25.39 lakh 

accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) 

and enrolled 35.67 lakh customers in social security schemes 

since inception. We now rank among the leading private sector 

banks in this regard. Under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana 

package, an amount of ` 500 per month each for April 2020, 

May 2020 and June 2020 has been credited to 14.13 lakh women 

PMJDY account holders under direct benefit transfer during the 

COVID-19 pandemic. In the year under review, loans to the tune 

of `  5,531.98  crore  to  8.94  lakh  beneficiaries  were  extended 

under  the  Pradhan  Mantri  Mudra  Yojana  (PMMY)  and  nearly 

` 82.60 crore to 388 beneficiaries under the ‘Stand up India’ 

scheme  to  Scheduled  Caste,  Scheduled  Tribe  and  women 

borrowers. Your Bank also has actively supported PM Street 

Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi (PMSVANIDHI) a special scheme 

under micro-credit facility for street vendors with a collateral free 

affordable term loan of ` 10,000 for 1 year, where your bank has 

disbursed ` 10,000 each to 3,157 street vendors to support them 

during the pandemic and have also educated the street vendors 

for using digital mode for making financial transactions.

E) Environmental Sustainability

Banking  by  the  very  nature  of  its  business,  is  environment-

friendly. During the year under review, your Bank has gone a little 

further. The Bank has undertaken several initiatives to reduce 

its Scope I and Scope II emissions and energy consumption in 

line  with its set targets.  To encapsulate your Bank’s philosophy, 

maintaining a balance between natural capital and communities 

is now integral to our functioning.

To  this  end,  our  ATMs  have  gone  paperless,  contributing  to 

a reduction of the carbon footprint. Your Bank has given this 

effort a further fillip by ensuring multi-channel delivery through 

NetBanking, Phone Banking, and Mobile Banking. This results 

in  lower  carbon  emission  not  just  from  operations,  but  also 

from reduced customer travel. We have installed rooftop solar 

panels in some of our large offices to supplement grid power 

with renewable energy.

F)   Business Enablers

1)   People Transformation

In a year which has seen the worst humanitarian and health 

crisis  of  the  century,  your  Bank  has  continued  to  show 

buoyant growth and resilience due to the commitment and 

tenacity of its people.

This year, your Bank, being in the essential services sector, 

had  to  strike  a  delicate  balance  between  ensuring  the 

health and safety of its employees while at the same time 

ensuring that banking operations continued unhindered. 

As an immediate response to the COVID-19 crisis, every 

effort was made to transition large sections of the employee 

base to ‘Work from home’. However, there were also several 

employees who had to continue to attend office physically 

as branches and ATMs continued to be functional during the 

lockdown. Hence a two-pronged approach was taken viz. 

a) Measures to ensure health and safety of employees who 

were physically required to attend office and b) Transition 

support to new ways of working to those who were working 

from home. The focus of the actions has been along three 

dimensions: a) Physical well-being, b) Psychological well-

being and c) Social well-being.

The  entire  employee  awareness  and  support  campaign 

under the aegis of #HumHaarNahinMaanenge’ and ‘HDFC 

Bank Cares’. which was initiated during the initial wave of 

the pandemic continues to run even now as we battle the 

second and more serious wave of the pandemic in India. The 

campaign also focused on building employee morale and 

resilience during this period of crisis. Your Bank’s internal 

communication channel ‘Our World’, which is accessible 

to  all  employees,  was  leveraged  to  ensure  all  relevant 

communication  reached  employees  through  a  single 

channel.  This  was  in  addition  to  regular  communication 

over emails.

Strengthening  our  Communication  Channels:  We 
strengthened  the  ‘structured’  Employee  Connect  on  the 
ground by our HR business partners to enable any urgent 
support to employees. A ‘We Care’ survey was rolled out 
during  April  2020  to  assess  employee  well-being  at  the 
start of the pandemic. This enabled employees who were 
operating in far-flung locations across the length and breadth 
of the country to reach out and seek help for themselves and 
their family members. Employees who needed medical help 
were connected with doctors and guided further on medical 
assistance. This was basis the Bank’s tie ups for medical 
insurance.

24*7 access to Doc on Call facility and Counselling facility 
was  provided  to  employees  and  their  families  to  seek 
immediate  medical  guidance  over  a  quick  phone  call 
during a crisis. Mental health issues due to stress have also 
increased globally during the pandemic. The counselling 
facility enabled employees to seek help while being assured 
of confidentiality.

Resource  Support:  Several  wellness  related  online 
videos were made available to employees to support their 
physical and mental well-being. Yoga sessions and online 
fitness challenges like Stepathalon etc. were conducted. An 
awareness campaign around building immunity practices 
and talks by psychologists to manage anxiety were also 
made available in the e-mode. We recognise the critical 
role  played  by  managers  in  ensuring  high  engagement 
levels amongst employees during this transition. Hence, 
resources  to  enable  managers  realign  themselves  to 
managing  their  teams  in  a  remote  working  environment 
have also been a key focus area.

Your  Bank  has  also  put  in  place  several  measures  to 
support employees who have been required to attend office 
in person in branches or at Central offices.

This  includes  temperature  screening  and  providing  an 
adequate  stock  of  sanitisers  for  those  coming  to  work. 
Rostering enables people to follow social distancing norms. 
Detailed guidelines and advisory on ‘Do’s and Don’ts’ at 
the workplace - have been circulated. Timely sanitisation 
and fumigation measures and periodic deep cleaning are 
being ensured. Strict norms for quarantine procedures, in 
case self or family members are found positive, are being 
adhered to.

As the first wave receded and a larger set of employees 
started coming to office physically, a detailed ‘Return to 
Work’ handbook ensured ready availability of guidelines to 
employees.

Social Wellness: We recognise that all through the harsh 
period  of  lockdown  and  social  distancing,  a  key  human 
need to bond and socialise with fellow colleagues has been 
left unfulfilled. This can result in considerable psychological 

stress.  So,  several  employee  connect  initiatives  were 
recalibrated to a digital mode to bring in the much needed 
social  bonding  and  recreational  element  at  work.  Your 
Bank’s annual talent competition ‘Hunar’ was run digitally 
and several new initiatives like Festive Webinars, a Digital 
Voice  Hunt,  online  photography  contests  etc.  were 
introduced. Effort was also made to bring in family members 
of the employees within the umbrella of these initiatives. 
Unique  participants  to  each  programme  aggregated  to 
more than 44,000 employees.

Policy  and  processes  to  support  remote  working  and 
impacted employees have been put in place. Employees 
affected  by  the  coronavirus  can  take  special  leave  until 
they recover over and above the regular leaves available 
to  them.  Detailed  guidelines  on  availing  staff  medical 
insurance have been circulated. We have also extended 
the medical insurance benefit for expenses incurred during 
home quarantine. Your Bank is also reimbursing the cost 
of vaccination for employees and their dependents. With 
the  rising  number  of  cases  in  the  second  wave,  we  are 
putting in place tie-ups through which employees can have 
ready access to quarantine and medical care facilities for 
themselves and their families.

All of the above have been designed to support employees 
and their families navigate through the crisis. We have also 
continued to pay regular salaries to all employees and also 
ensured annual increments,  bonus and promotions in line 
with  the  usual  cycle  followed  in  your  Bank.  There  have 
been no lay-offs and the sense of security instilled amongst 
employees has gone a long way in ensuring a high level of 
employee engagement.

During the initial phase of the lockdown, your Bank focused 
on utilising the available productive time of employees in 
skill  building  and  learning  certifications.  To  enable  this, 
the  entire  learning  architecture  was  made  available  in  a 
digital mode on a war footing. Innovative ways of imparting 
learning  to  a  remote  workforce  were  explored  and 
appropriate  certifications  based  on  business  need  were 
made  available  in  a  digital  mode.  As  many  as  33  lakh+ 
learning certifications were completed with more than one 
lakh employees completing at least one certification.

We recognise that an essential quality 
which has helped your Bank and its 
large employee base spread across 
geographies respond so well to the crisis 
is a culture which is highly resilient and 
deeply rooted in what we know as the 
‘HDFC Bank way’ of doing things.

Bank has embarked on a conscious journey of a Culture 
Transformation which is enshrined along with the critical 
leadership tenets of ‘Nurture, Care and Collaborate’.

A  large  scale  organisation  transformation  which  is 
leader-led,  with  interventions  designed  to  reach  every 
supervisor in the Bank across every remote geographical 
location,  is  an  ambitious  goal  which  we  have  set  for 
ourselves  This  is  expected  to  result  in  an  engaged 
workforce  which  in  turn  will  be  a  source  of  competitive 
advantage. A blend of interventions based on the 70:20:10 
principle  ranging  from  fireside  chats  with  leaders,  video 
messages,  on  the  job  activities  have  been  incorporated 
into this which will run well into the coming year as well.  
A culture based on the ethos of ‘Nurture, Care, Collaborate’  
pre-supposes the existence of an inclusive culture. A video-
based campaign under the aegis of ‘Valuing Differences’ 
was launched to create awareness on inclusion.

In  addition,  we  have  continued  to  focus  on  creating  the 
building blocks of an institutionalised approach to talent 
management in the Bank. This year was witness to several 
initiatives aimed at strengthening the talent pipeline and 
putting in place clearly visible succession plans for 100+ 
senior leadership positions. Detailed talent review meetings 
in order to have a formal, unified, organisation-wide view 
of  talent  and  chalking  out  focused  development  plans 
which started last year, have been now recalibrated to a 
virtual set-up. It is now being institutionalised. as a defined 
practice.  Focus  is  now  on  creating  technology  enablers 
which  will  help  deepen  this  process  across  your  Bank. 
Likewise, the availability and identification of successors to 
senior leadership positions has been a key focus area. The 
emphasis will now be on ensuring required developmental 
inputs to ensure high level of readiness.

SPARK was a structured Leadership Development initiative 
for 100+ senior leaders which was delivered in conjunction 
with  a  globally  acclaimed  partner.  It  was  developed 
basis  detailed  discovery  workshops  with  the  senior 
leadership and was delivered in a blended format, which 
included  self-discovery  through  rigorous  psychometrics 
and individualised coaching sessions, fireside chats and 
state-of-the-art courseware for self-paced learning. This 
is the first step towards building a structured approach to 
leadership development, catering to varying needs across 
different leadership levels.

The focus on building a talent pipeline at the entry level 
through  the  job-ready  model  termed  ‘Future  Bankers 
Program’, created in partnership with the Manipal Global 
Academy of BFSI, has done well. There have been 1500+ 
enrolments into the programme pan-India and candidates 
from the initial batches have been successfully absorbed 
into full time roles after an internship with your Bank.

Your Bank was at the seventh place in the Business Today 
list of India’s Coolest Workplaces.

2) Information Technology 
New Ways of Banking
In the last year, the global pandemic has changed the way 
India banks. Digital banking has become a way of life and 
your bank has been taking consistent steps to ensure a 
smooth and safe customer experience. In the new normal, 
your Bank has introduced new ways to bank, such as:
(cid:116)  

Insta Account Opening: This allows instant account 
opening with just a mobile, Aadhaar and PAN numbers

(cid:116)   Video  KYC:  Automation  of  KYC  process  through 
video  calling  from  the  comfort  and  safety  of  a 
customer’s home

Strengthening Technology Infrastructure
Digital  Products  are  only  as  strong  as  the  infrastructure 
supporting  them.  In  the  last  12  months,  your  Bank  has 
taken multiple steps to ensure robust, scalable and secure 
technology.

Some key initiatives include:
(cid:116)   Capacity  for  UPI  has  been  tripled:  Your  Bank  has 
successfully managed over 23 lakh transactions in an 
hour. It is ranked among the top in the published NPCI 
dashboard of UPI Performance Metrics

(cid:116)  

Technical declines are down with the average uptime 
for  customers  at  99.91  per  cent  in  the  year  under 
review

(cid:116)   Net Banking and Mobile Banking capacity has been 
doubled  to  manage  90,000  users  concurrently;  a 
significant step as most of our customers now rely on 
our digital channels for banking needs

(cid:121)   Your  bank  has  migrated  core  Data  Centres  in 
Bengaluru and Mumbai to state-of-the-art facilities

(cid:116)   Disaster  Recovery  drills  have  been  completed  for 
all critical payment systems. This has reinforced our 
capability to switchover in less than 45 minutes when 
needed

Technology Issues and Solutions
Your  Bank  faces  technology  challenges  and  humbly 
accepts It and is actively working towards resolving it.

Things however have to be seen in perspective. Your Bank 
could  not  have  become  a  leading  player  in  the  space, 
grown its market share across business segments (y-o-y) 
and serviced millions of customers in real time without a 
strong technology backbone.

In  the  last  28  months,  your  Bank  has  experienced  five 
instances  of  downtime.  Every  instance  has  hardened 
its  resolve  to  do  better.  The  country  has  embarked  on 
a  tremendous  digitisation  drive  across  all  sectors  of 
the  economy.  And  your  Bank  is  committed  to  rising  to 
the  occasion  and  delivering  value  for  all  stakeholders 
by  implementing  cutting-edge  technology  solutions. 
This  transformation  is  an  ongoing  journey.  Some  of  the 
technology  transformation  will  be  implemented  with 
strategic long-term objectives such as adopting the latest 
best-in-class technology.

Your  Bank  also  has  ambitious  growth  plans.  In  this 
context, it has embarked on a scale changing technology 
adoption and transformation agenda. Our aim is to ‘Keep 
Systems ALWAYS ON. ALWAYS SECURE. AND PERFORM 
at  SCALE’.  Some  of  the  specific  initiatives  that  we  have 
embarked  on  in our  Technology  Transformation  Agenda 
include:  Infrastructure  scalability,  Disaster  Recovery 
(DR)  resiliency,  Security  Enhancements  and  Enhanced 
Monitoring Mechanisms.

Your Bank continues to invest in IT products, infrastructure, 
services and tools to ensure a seamless banking experience. 
Key initiatives like a streamlined Customer Experience Hub 
and a modernised and significantly strengthened customer 
experience, allowing access to content across channels 
and devices, are on the anvil. Your Bank will continue to 
innovate and provide an enhanced digital experience so 
that your banking needs can be fulfilled in a safe, secure 
and convenient manner.

3)  Service Quality Initiatives and Grievance Redressal
Customer  Focus  is  one  of  the  five  core  values  of  your 
Bank.  Driven  by  this  core  value,  your  Bank  has  always 
endeavoured  to  improve  customer  experience  and  has 
adopted a holistic approach for the same across multiple 
channels. This is critical in a highly competitive business 

140

environment,  especially  since  it  has  various  lines  of 
businesses. Ensuring product quality and service delivery 
becomes  vital  for  business  growth.  Your  Bank  desires 
to achieve this by seeking customer feedback as well as 
benchmarking  with  best-in-class  business  entities.  Your 
Bank  invites  and  reviews  the  performance  on  customer 
service as well as  grievance redressal at different levels 
- Branch Level Customer Service Committees (BLCSCs), 
Standing  Committee  on  Customer  Service  (SCCS)  and 
Customer Service Committee of the Board (CSCB).

Your  Bank  has  adopted  a  multi-pronged  approach  to 
provide an omnichannel experience to its customers. On 
one side, your Bank has traditional touch points like branch 
and  phonebanking,  and  on  the  other  side,  it  has  state-
of-the-art  platforms  like  Net  Banking,  Mobile  Banking, 
the chatbot Eva offering a wide range of channel choice 
to its customers. Your Bank has also improvised on the 
relationship  based  banking  programmes.  In  addition  to 
the  branch  based  relationship  managers,  it  now  has  a 
Virtual Relationship Manager (VRM) programme to cater 
to various financial needs in a personalised manner. Your 
Bank has put robust processes in place to regularly monitor 
and measure quality of service levels not only at various 
touch points but also at a product and process level by 
a specialised team called Quality Initiatives Group, which 
also works towards implementing strategic initiatives of your 
Bank through customer experience management.

As  part  of  its  continuous  efforts  to  enhance  quality  of 
service,  the  Service  Quality  team  carries  out  regular 
reviews,  including  mystery  shopping  across  various 
products/processes/channels  by  following  a  structured 
calendar. Service Quality reviews span across all customer 
touch  points  like  Retail  Branches,  ATM,  PhoneBanking, 
NetBanking, MobileBanking, Email Services, Relationship 
based banking etc, and cover key service parameters like 
adherence  of  stipulated  TAT,  complaints  reduction  and 
transactions monitoring to ensure meeting the committed 
service  levels  along  with  process  enhancements. 
The  effectiveness  of  the  quality  of  service  is  reviewed 
periodically  at  different  levels,  including  the  Customer 
Service Committee of the Board.

Your Bank has provided multiple channels to its customers 
to share feedback on its services as well as register their 
grievances.  It  has  a  Grievance  Redressal  Policy,  duly 
approved by its Board, available in the public domain for 
ready  reference  of  the  customers.  Your  Bank  is  at  the 
forefront of developing innovative financial solutions and 
digital  platforms.  This,  coupled  with  concerted  efforts 
at  creating  awareness  among  customers,  has  led  to 
an  increase  in  the  use  of  its  digital  channels  as  well  as 
customer  loyalty.  Keeping  customer  interest  in  focus, 
your  Bank  has  formulated  a  Board  approved  Customer

Your  Bank  is  on  a  journey  to  measure  customer  loyalty 

through a high velocity, closed loop customer feedback 

system.  This  customer  experience  transformation 

programme  will  help  employees  empathise  better  with 

customers  and  improve  turnaround  times.  Branded  as 

‘Infinite  Smiles’,  the  programme  would  help  establish 

behaviours and practices that result in customer-centric 

actions  through  continuous  improvements  in  product, 

services, process and policies.

Thanks to these initiatives, your Bank’s customer complaints 

for  FY  21  decreased  by  14.8  per  cent  to  3,25,786  from 

3,82,235 in the previous year.

Traditionally,  the  key  risks  that  your  Bank  is  exposed  to 

in the course of its business have been the Pillar 1 risks 

-  Credit  Risk,  Market  Risk  and  Operational  Risk.  Given 

the evolving banking landscape, Liquidity Risk and Cyber 

Security  Risk  are  also  vital.  These  risks  not  only  have  a 

bearing on your Bank’s financial strength and operations 

but  also  on  its  reputation.  Keeping  this  in  mind,  the 

Bank  has  put  in  place  Board-approved  risk  strategy 

and  policies,  whose  implementation  is  supervised  by 

the  Risk  Policy  and  Monitoring  Committee  (RPMC).  The 

Committee monitors the compliance of risk parameters /

aggregate exposures with the appetite set by the Board. 

It ensures that frameworks are established for assessing 

and managing various risks faced by your Bank, systems 

are  developed  to  relate  risk  to  the  Bank‘s  capital  level 

and methods are in place for monitoring compliance with 

internal risk management policies and processes. It guides 

the development of policies, procedures and systems for 

managing  risks.  It  ensures  that  these  are  adequate  and 

appropriate to changing business conditions, the structure 

and needs of your Bank and its risk appetite.

The hallmark of your Bank’s risk management function is 

that it is independent of the business sourcing unit with 

convergence only at the CEO level.

The  gamut  of  key  risks  faced  by  the  Bank  which  are 

dimensioned and managed include:

Credit Risk

Credit Risk is defined as the possibility of losses associated with 

diminution in the credit quality of borrowers or counterparties. 

Losses  stem  from  outright  default  or  reduction  in  portfolio 

value.  Your  Bank  has  a  distinct  credit  risk  architecture, 

policies, procedures and systems for managing credit risk in 

both its retail and wholesale businesses. Wholesale lending is 

managed on an individual as well as portfolio basis. In contrast, 

retail lending, given the granularity of individual exposures, is 

managed largely on a portfolio basis across various products 

and customer segments. For both categories, there are robust 

front-end and back-end systems in place to ensure credit quality 

and to minimise loss from default. The factors considered while 

sanctioning retail loans include income, demographics, credit 

history, loan tenor and banking behaviour. In addition, there are 

multiple credit risk models developed and used to appraise and 

score different segments of customers on the basis of portfolio 

behaviour. In wholesale loans, credit risk is managed by capping 

exposures on the basis of borrower group, industry, credit rating 

grades and country, among others. This is backed by portfolio 

diversification, stringent credit approval processes and periodic 

post-disbursement  monitoring  and  remedial  measures.  Your 

Bank  has  been  able  to  ensure  strong  asset  quality  through 

volatile times in the lending environment by stringently adhering 

to prudent norms and institutionalised processes.

During  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  your  Bank  followed  RBI 

directions and granted moratorium, loans backed by Government 

guaranteed schemes and also carried out one-time restructuring 

of the accounts. Your Bank has been prudent and adaptive in 

ensuring  higher  risk  standards  and  proactively  reviewing  risk 

thresholds keeping in mind the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, 

your Bank assessed the potential stress impact of the pandemic 

on the credit profile of the Bank basis the available information 

accompanied with assumptions and judgemental overlay. As 

on March 31, 2021, your Bank’s ratio of Gross Non Performing 

Assets (GNPAs) to Gross Advances was 1.32 per cent. Net Non-

performing Assets (Gross Non-Performing Assets Less Specific 

Loan Loss provisions) was 0.40 per cent of Net Advances.

Your Bank has a conservative and prudent policy for specific 

provisions on NPAs. Its provision for NPAs is higher than the 

minimum regulatory requirements and adheres to the regulatory 

norms for Standard Assets.

Digital Lending and Credit Risk
Driven  by  rapid  advancements  in  technology,  digitalisation  is 
increasingly becoming a key differentiator for customer retention 
and service delivery in the banking sector. Digital lending enables 
customers to secure loans at the click of a button in a matter of 
minutes, if not seconds. However, there are also attendant risks 
associated with it and your Bank has put in place appropriate 
checks and balances to manage these risks. Such loans are 
sanctioned primarily to your Bank’s existing customers. Often, 
they are customers across multiple products, thus enabling the 
Bank ready access to their credit history and risk profile. This 
facilitates evaluation on their loan eligibility. Besides, most of the 
credit checks and scores used by your Bank in process-based 
underwriting are replicated for digital loans. The Bank has an 
independent model validation unit that minutely assesses the 
models used to generate the credit scores for such loans. These 
models are monitored, reviewed periodically, back tested and 
corrective action is taken whenever needed.

Market Risk
Market Risk arises largely from your Bank’s statutory reserve 
management  and  trading  activity  in  interest  rates,  equity  and 
currency market. These risks are managed through a well-defined 
Board approved Market Risk Policy, Investment Policy, Foreign 
Exchange Trading Policy and Derivatives Policy that caps risk in 
different trading desks or various securities through trading risk 
limits/triggers. The risk measures include position limits, tenor 
restrictions, sensitivity limits, namely, PV01, Modified Duration 
of Hold to Maturity Portfolio and Option Greeks, Value-at-Risk 
(VaR) Limit, Stop Loss Trigger Level (SLTL), Scenario based P&L 
Triggers, Potential Loss Trigger Level (PLTL), and are monitored on 
an end-of-day basis. In addition, forex open positions, currency 
option  delta  and  interest  rate  sensitivity  limits  are  computed 
and monitored on an intraday basis. This is supplemented by 
a  Board-approved  stress  testing  policy  and  framework  that 
simulates various market risk scenarios to measure losses and 
initiate remedial measures. The Market Risk capital charge of 
your Bank is computed on a daily basis using the Standardised 
Measurement Method applying the regulatory factors.

Your  Bank’s  framework  for  liquidity  and  interest  rate  risk 
management is spelt out in its Asset Liability Management Policy 
that  is  implemented,  monitored  and  periodically  reviewed  by 
the Asset Liability Committee (ALCO). As part of this process, 
your Bank has established various Board-approved limits, both 
for liquidity and interest rate risks. While the maturity gap and 
stock ratio limits help manage liquidity risk, net interest income 
and market value impacts help mitigate interest rate risk. This is 
reinforced by a comprehensive Board-approved stress testing 
programme covering both liquidity and interest rate risk. Due 
to the moratorium on loans and advances announced by the 
RBI during the COVID-19 pandemic, your Bank has conducted 
liquidity stress under an additional stress scenario, assuming 
incremental moratorium availed by  customers and the stress 
gaps were within the internal threshold defined.

Your Bank conducts various studies to assess the behavioural 
pattern of non-contractual assets and liabilities and embedded 
options available to customers, which are used while managing 
maturity  gaps.  Further,  your  Bank  also  has  the  necessary 
framework in place to manage intraday liquidity risk.

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a global standard, is also 
used to measure your Bank’s liquidity position. LCR seeks to 
ensure that the Bank has an adequate stock of unencumbered 
High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted into 
cash easily and immediately to meet its liquidity needs under 
a 30-day calendar liquidity stress scenario.  While the RBI had 
provided dispensation to maintain the LCR at 80 per cent until 
September 30, 2020 and at 90 per cent until March 31, 2021 
owing  to  COVID  19  pandemic,  your  Bank  has  consistently 
maintained the LCR well above 100 per cent. Based on Basel 
III  norms,  your  Bank’s  LCR  stood  at  137.95  per  cent  on  a 
consolidated basis for FY 2020-21.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio
137.95 per cent   
on a consolidated basis for FY 2020-21

Further, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, your Bank evaluated 
the  plausible  Mark  to  Market  (MTM)  impact  on  the  trading 
portfolio, assuming judgemental scenario shocks, and undertook 
frequent reviews of trading portfolio for optimised deployment of 
surplus liquidity within the Bank. It is observed that at the onset 
of the pandemic, most of the asset classes became extremely 
volatile  and  the  market  witnessed  significant  correction  in 
equities, weakening of domestic currency, surge in corporate 
spreads, etc under extreme risk aversion. Subsequently, both 
the global and Indian markets showed a sharp recovery.

The RBI has also proposed a minimum Net Stable Funding Ratio 
(NSFR) of 100 per cent, which shall be effective from October 
1, 2021. The NSFR seeks to ensure that your Bank maintains a 
stable funding profile in relation to the composition of its assets 
and off-balance sheet activities. As a prudent risk management 
practice, your Bank has been monitoring this ratio, and is thus 
adequately prepared to meet the RBI mandated requirements.

The accommodative policy stance by the RBI during the pandemic 
has resulted in the system liquidity at elevated levels. Your Bank 
also had a comfortable liquidity surplus during the year.

Given  below  is  a  detailed  explanation  under  four  different 
heads: Framework and Process, Internal Control, Information 
Technology and Security Practices and Fraud Monitoring and 
Control.

a.   Framework and Process

To manage Operational Risks, your Bank has in place a 
comprehensive Operational Risk Management Framework, 
whose  implementation  is  supervised  by  the  Operational 
Risk  Management  Committee  (ORMC)  and  reviewed  by 
the  RPMC  of  the  Board.  An  independent  Operational 
Risk  Management  Department  (ORMD)  implements  the 
framework. Under the framework, the Bank has three lines 
of  defence.  The  first  line  of  defence  is  the  business  line 
(including support and operations).

The first line is primarily responsible for managing Operational 
Risk on a daily basis, in addition to implementing internal 
control-related policies and procedures.

The second line of defence is the ORMD, which develops 
policies, procedures, tools and techniques to assess and 
monitor  the  adequacy  and  effectiveness  of  your  Bank’s 
internal controls. In order to achieve the aforesaid objective 
pertaining to operational risk management framework, the 
ORMC oversees the ORMD with special focus on:
(cid:116)  

Identification and assessment of risks across the Bank 
through the Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) 
and Scenario analysis

(cid:116)   Measurement of Operational Risk based on the actual 

loss data;

(cid:116)   Monitoring of risk through Key Risk Indicators (KRI)) and

(cid:116)   Management and reporting through KRI, RCSA and 

loss data of the Bank. 

(cid:116) 

Internal Audit is the third line of defence. The team 
reviews  the  effectiveness  of  governance,  risk 
management and internal controls within your Bank.

b.  

Internal Control
Your Bank has implemented sound internal control practices 
across all processes, units and functions. It has well laid 
down policies and processes for management of its day-to-
day activities. Your Bank follows established, well-designed 
controls,  which  include  traditional  four  eye  principles, 
effective segregation of business and support functions, 
segregation of duties, call back processes, reconciliation, 
exception  reporting  and  periodic  MIS.  Specialised  risk 
control units function in risk prone products/ functions to 
minimise operational risk. Controls are tested as part of the 
SOX control testing framework.

various  operations.  This  throws  up  operational  risks 
such as business disruption, risks related to information 
assets,  data  security,  integrity,  reliability  and  availability, 
among others. Your Bank has put in place a governance 
framework,  information  security  practices  and  business 
continuity plan to mitigate IT-related risks. An independent 
assurance team within Internal Audit provides assurance 
on the management of IT-related risks.

Your Bank has a robust Business Continuity and Disaster 
Recovery  plan  that  is  periodically  tested  to  ensure  that 
it  can  meet  any  operational  contingencies.  There  is  an 
independent  Information  Security Group that addresses 
information  security  related  risks.  A  well-documented 
Board-approved  information  security  policy  and  cyber 
security  policy  are  in  place.  Your  Bank  also  has  a  well-
documented crisis management plan in place to address 
the  strategic  issues  of  a  crisis  impacting  the  Bank  and 
to  direct  and  communicate  the  corporate  response  to 
the  crisis  including  cyber  crisis.  In  addition,  employees 
mandatorily and periodically undergo information security 
training and sensitisation exercises.

d.   Fraud Monitoring and Control

Your Bank has put in place a Whistle Blower and Vigilance 
policy  and  a  central  vigilance  team  that  oversees  the 
implementation  of  fraud  prevention  measures.  Frauds 
are  investigated  to  identify  the  root  cause  and  relevant 
corrective steps are taken to prevent recurrence.

Fraud Monitoring committees at the senior management 
and Board level also deliberate on material fraud events and 
advise preventive actions. Periodic reports are submitted 
to the Board and senior management committees.

Compliance Risk
Compliance Risk is defined as the risk of impairment of your 
Bank’s integrity, leading to  damage to its reputation, legal or 
regulatory sanctions, or financial loss, as a result of a failure (or 
perceived failure) to comply with applicable laws, regulations and 
standards. Your Bank has a Compliance Policy to ensure the 
highest standards of compliance. A dedicated team of subject 
matter  experts  in  the  Compliance  Department  works  with 
business and operations teams to ensure active Compliance Risk 
management and monitoring. The team also provides advisory 
services on regulatory matters. The focus is on identifying and 
reducing risk by rigorously testing products and also putting in 
place robust internal policies. Products that adhere to regulatory 
norms are tested after rollout and shortcomings, if any, are fully 
addressed till the product stabilises on its own. Internal policies 
are reviewed and updated periodically as per agreed frequency 
or based on market actions or regulatory guidelines /actions. 
The compliance team also seeks regular feedback on regulatory 
compliance from product, business and operation teams through 
self-certifications and monitoring.

Information Technology and Security Practices
Your  Bank  operates  in  a  highly  automated  environment 
and  makes  use  of  the  latest  technologies  to  support

is carried out by integrating the stress tests of the subsidiaries. 
Similarly, capital  adequacy projections are formulated for the 
group  after  incorporating  the  business/capital  plans  of  the 
subsidiaries.

ICAAP
Your  Bank  has  a  structured  management  framework  in  the 
Internal  Capital  Adequacy  Assessment  Process  (ICAAP)  to 
identify, assess and manage all risks that may have a material 
adverse  impact  on  its  business/financial  position/capital 
adequacy.  The  ICAAP  framework  is  guided  by  the  Board-
approved ICAAP Policy.

Stress Testing Framework
Your Bank has implemented a Board approved Stress Testing 
Policy and Framework which forms an integral part of the Bank’s 
ICAAP.  Stress  testing  involves  the  use  of  various  techniques 
to  assess  your  Bank’s  potential  vulnerability  to  extreme  but 
plausible  stressed  business  conditions.  The  changes  in  the 
levels  of  Pillar  I  risks  and  select  Pillar  II  risks,  along  with  the 
changes in the on and off balance sheet positions of your Bank 
are assessed under assumed ‘stress’ scenarios and sensitivity 
factors. Typically, these relate, inter alia, to the impact on your 
Bank’s profitability and capital adequacy.

In the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, your Bank developed 
a  topical  stress  scenario  to  assess  the  impact  of  COVID-19 
stress  on  Credit  Risk,  Market  Risk  and  Liquidity  Risk.  The 
COVID-19 pandemic crisis has been unprecedented, uncertain 
and  continuously  evolving.  Thus  the  underlying  assumptions 
and  building  blocks  of  the  stress  methodology  get  modified 
depending upon how the pandemic evolves domestically and 
globally. The stress results from this framework are deployed to 
ascertain the capital consumption under Pillar II risks as well as 
the overall impact on the capital adequacy of your Bank.

The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has been 
unprecedented, uncertain and continuously 
evolving. Thus the underlying assumptions 
and building blocks of the stress 
methodology get modified depending upon 
how the pandemic evolves domestically and 
globally.

Group Risk
Your Bank has two subsidiaries, HDB Financial Services Limited 
and HDFC Securities Limited. The Board of each subsidiary is 
responsible for managing their respective material risks (Credit 
Risk, Market Risk, Operational Risk, Liquidity Risk, Technology 
Risk, Reputation Risk, Compliance Risk and others). The Group 
Risk  Management  Committee  (GRMC)  was  instituted  in  your 
Bank  under  the  ICAAP  framework  to  establish  a  formal  and 
dedicated structure to periodically assess the nature/quantum 
of  material  risks  of  the  subsidiaries  and  adequacy  of  its  risk 
management processes. Stress testing for the group as a whole 

144

Business Continuity Planning (BCP)
Your Bank has an ISO 22301 certified Business Continuity Plan 
(BCP)  in  place  to  minimise  service  disruptions  and  potential 
impact  on  its  business,  employees  and  customers  during 
any unforeseen adverse  event  or circumstances. The central 
Business  Continuity  Office  works  towards  strengthening  the 
continuity preparedness. The plan is designed in accordance 
with  the  regulatory  guidelines  and  is  reviewed  regularly.  The 
implementation is overseen by the Information Security Group 
and the Business Continuity Steering Committee which is chaired 
by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). The Business Continuity Policy 
and Procedure defines roles for Crisis Management, Business 
Recovery,  Emergency  Response  and  IT  Disaster  Recovery 
Planning teams. Please refer to page 54 for more details.

Ensuring Business Continuity during COVID 19
Team HDFC Bank rose to the challenge of delivering banking 
services during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Your 
Bank emerged successfully from the nationwide lockdown and 
adopted a hybrid approach of working from home, nearby location 
as well as base location in accordance with pandemic protocols 
that have been periodically released by the Government.

This  has  ensured  that  we  continue  to  keep  the  safety  of  our 
employees as our first priority. It was realised that the pandemic 
situation  was  going  to  be  a  long  haul.  Therefore  the  teams 
adopted various continuity strategies like split operations, work 
transfer, people transfer and work from home to move from crisis 
mode  to  business  mode  and  continue  delivering  services  to 
customers.

5) Implementation of Indian Accounting Standards 
(IND-AS)
The  Ministry  of  Corporate  Affairs,  in  its  press  release  dated 
January 18, 2016, had issued a roadmap for implementation of 
Indian Accounting Standards (IND-AS) for scheduled commercial 
banks, insurers/insurance companies and non-banking financial 
companies. This roadmap required these institutions to prepare 
IND-AS based financial statements for the accounting periods 
beginning  April  1,  2018  with  comparatives  for  the  periods 
beginning  April  1,  2017.  The  RBI,  through  its  circular  dated 
February  11,  2016,  required  all  scheduled  commercial  banks 
to comply with IND-AS for financial statements for the stated 
periods. The RBI did not permit banks to adopt IND-AS earlier 
than the stated timelines. The said guidelines also stated that 
the RBI shall issue necessary instructions/guidance/clarifications 
on the relevant aspects for implementation of IND-AS as and 
when required.

The  implementation  of  IND-AS  by  banks  requires  certain 
legislative  changes  in  the  format  of  financial  statements  to

Introduction to

comply with the disclosures required under IND-AS. The change 

in the format requires an amendment to the third schedule of the 

Banking Regulation Act, 1949 to make it compatible with the 

presentation of financial statements under IND-AS. Considering 

the amendments needed to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, 

as well as the level of preparedness of several banks, the RBI, 

through its Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies 

dated April 5, 2018, had deferred the implementation of IND-AS 

by a year by when the necessary legislative amendments were 

expected. The legislative amendments recommended by the RBI 

are under consideration by the Government of India. Accordingly, 

the RBI, through its circular dated March 22, 2019, deferred the 

implementation of IND-AS until further notice.

The implementation of IND-AS is expected to result in significant 

changes to the way your Bank prepares and presents its financial 

statements.  The  areas  that  are  expected  to  have  significant 

accounting impact on the application of IND-AS are summarised 

below:

1) Financial assets (which include advances and investments) 

shall be classified under amortised cost, fair value through other 

comprehensive income (a component of reserves and surplus) or 

fair value through profit/loss categories on the basis of the nature 

of the cash flows and the intention of holding the financial assets.

2) Interest will be recognised in the income statement using the 

effective interest rate method, where the coupon, fees net of 

transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts will be 

amortised over the life of the financial instrument.

3) Stock options will be required to be fair valued on the date 

of  grant  and  be  recognised  as  staff  expenses  in  the  income 

statement over the vesting period of the stock options.

4)  The  impairment  requirements  of  IND-AS  109,  Financial 

Instruments,  are  based  on  an  Expected  Credit  Loss  (ECL) 

model that replaces the incurred loss model under the extant 

framework. Your Bank will generally be required to recognise 

either  a  12-month  or  lifetime  ECL,  depending  upon  whether 

there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  since 

initial recognition. IND-AS 109 will change the Bank’s current 

methodology for calculating the provision for standard assets 

and NPAs. Your Bank will be required to apply a three-stage 

approach to measure ECL on financial instruments accounted 

for at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive 

income.  Financial  assets  will  migrate  through  the  following 

three stages based on the changes in credit quality since initial 

recognition:

Stage 1: 12-Month ECL

For exposures which have not been assessed as credit-impaired 

or where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk 

since initial recognition, the portion of the ECL associated with 

the  probability  of  default  events  occurring  within  the  next  12 

months will need to be recognised.

Stage 2: Lifetime ECL - not Credit impaired

For credit exposures where there has been a significant increase 

in credit risk since initial recognition but are not credit-impaired, 

a lifetime ECL will need to be recognised.

Stage 3: Lifetime ECL - Credit impaired

Financial assets will be assessed as credit impaired when one 

or more events having a detrimental impact on the estimated 

future cash flows of that asset have occurred. For financial assets 

that have become credit impaired, a lifetime ECL will need to be 

recognised.

Interest  revenue  will  be  recognised  at  the  original  effective 

interest rate applied on the gross carrying amount for assets 

falling under stages 1 and 2 and on written down amount for the 

assets falling under stage 3.

5) Accounting impact on the application of IND-AS at the transition 

date shall be recognised in equity (reserves and surplus).

Your Bank, being an associate of Housing Development Finance 

Corporation  Limited  (the  ‘Corporation’),  is  required  to  submit 

its  consolidated  financial  information  (‘fit-for-consolidation 

information’), prepared in accordance with the recognition and 

measurement principles of IND-AS as specified under Section 

133  of  the  Companies  Act,  2013,  to  the  Corporation  for  the 

purposes of the consolidated financial statements/results of the 

Corporation. The results of the Bank upon its first-time adoption 

of and transition to IND-AS, based on the updated regulations 

and accounting standards/guidance and business strategy at 

the date of actual transition, could differ from those reported in 

the fit-for-consolidation information.

6) Internal Controls, Audit and Compliance

Your  Bank  has  put  in  place  extensive  internal  controls  and 

processes to mitigate Operational Risks, including centralised 

operations and ‘segregation of duty’ between the front office 

and back office. The front-office units usually act as customer 

touch-points and sales and service outlets while the back-office 

carries  out  the  entire  processing,  accounting  and  settlement 

of transactions in the Bank’s core banking system. The policy 

framework, definition and monitoring of limits is carried out by 

various mid-office and risk management functions. The credit 

sanctioning and debt management units are also segregated 

and do not have any sales and operations responsibilities.

Your Bank has set up various executive-level committees, with 

participation from various business and control functions, that 

are designed to review and oversee matters pertaining to capital, 

assets and liabilities, business practices and customer service, 

Operational  Risk,  information  security,  business  continuity 

planning  and  internal  risk-based  supervision  among  others. 

The control functions set standards and lay down policies and 

procedures  by  which  the  business  functions  manage  risks, 

including  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  compliance  with 

regulatory  guidelines,  adherence  to  operational  controls  and

relevant standards of conduct. At the ground level, your Bank 
has  a  mix  of  preventive  and  detective  controls  implemented 
through systems and processes, ensuring a robust framework 
in  your  Bank  to  enable  correct  and  complete  accounting, 
identification of outliers (if any) by the Management on a timely 
basis for corrective action and mitigating Operational Risks.

Your  Bank  has  put  in  place  various  preventive  
controls:
(a)  Limited and need-based access to systems by users

(b)  Dual custody over cash and near-cash items

(c)  Segregation of duty in processing of transactions vis-à-vis 

creation of user IDs

(d)  Segregation of duty in processing of transactions vis-à-vis 
monitoring and review of transactions/reconciliation

(e)  Four eye principle (maker-checker control) for processing 

of transactions

(f)  Stringent password policy

(g)  Booking of transactions in core banking system mandates 
the earmarking of line/limit (fund as well as non-fund based) 
assigned to the customer

(h)  STP processes between core banking system and payment 

interface systems for transmission of messages

(i)  Additional authorisation leg in payment interface systems 

in applicable cases

(j)  Audit logs directly extracted from systems

(k)  Empowerment grid

Your Bank also has detective controls in place:
(a)  Periodic review of user IDs

(b)  Post-transaction monitoring at the back-end by way of call 
back process (through daily log reports) by an independent 
person, i.e., to ascertain that entries in the core banking 
system/messages in payment interface systems are based 
on valid/authorised transactions and customer requests

(c)  Daily tally of cash and near-cash items at end of day

(d)  Reconciliation  of  Nostro  accounts  (by  an  independent 
team) to ascertain and match-off the Nostro credits and 
debits  (External  or  Internal)  regularly  to    avoid  /  identify 
any unreconciled/unmatched entries passing through the 
system

(e)  Reconciliation of all Suspense Accounts and establishment 

of responsibility in case of outstanding

(f) 

Independent  and  surprise  checks  periodically  by 
supervisors

Your Bank has an Internal Audit Department which is responsible 
for independently evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of 
all internal controls, risk management, governance systems and 
processes and is manned by appropriately qualified personnel.

This department adopts a risk-based audit approach and carries 
out audits across various businesses i.e. Retail, Wholesale and 
Treasury  (for  India  and  Overseas  books),  audit  of  Operations 
units, Management Audits, Information Security Audit, Revenue 
Audit and Concurrent Audit in order to independently evaluate the 
adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls on an ongoing 
basis and pro-actively recommending enhancements thereof. 
The Internal Audit Department, during the course of audit, also 
ascertains  the  extent  of  adherence  to  regulatory  guidelines, 
legal  requirements  and  operational  processes  and  provides 
timely feedback to the Management for corrective actions. A 
strong oversight on the operations is also kept through off-site 
monitoring.

The  Internal  Audit  Department  also  independently  reviews 
your  Bank’s  implementation  of  Internal  Rating  Based  (IRB)-
approach for calculation of capital charge for Credit Risk, the 
appropriateness of your Bank’s ICAAP, as well as evaluates the 
quality and comprehensiveness of your Bank’s disaster recovery 
and business continuity plans and also carries out management 
self-assessment  of  adequacy  of  the  Bank’s  internal  financial 
controls and operating effectiveness of such controls in terms 
of Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) Act and Companies Act, 2013.

Any new product/process introduced in your Bank is reviewed by 
Compliance function in order to ensure adherence to regulatory 
guidelines  and  also  by  Internal  Audit  from  the  perspective  of 
existence of internal controls. The Audit function also proactively 
recommends  improvements  in  operational  processes  and 
service quality, wherever deemed fit.

To  ensure  independence,  the  Internal  Audit  Function  has  a 
reporting line to the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the 
Board and a dotted line reporting to the Managing Director.

The  Compliance  function  independently  tracks,  reviews  and 
ensures compliance with regulatory guidelines and promotes a 
compliance culture in the Bank.

Your  Bank  has  a  comprehensive  Know  Your  Customer, 
Anti  Money  Laundering  (AML)  and  Combating  Financing  of 
Terrorism (CFT) policy (based on the RBI guidelines/provisions 
of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002) incorporating 
the  key  elements  of  Customer  Acceptance  Policy,  Customer 
Identification Procedures, Risk Management and Monitoring of 
Transactions. The policy is subjected to an annual review and is 
duly approved by the Board.

G) Performance of Subsidiary Companies
Your Bank has two subsidiaries, HDB Financial Services Limited 
(HDBFSL)  and  HDFC  Securities  Limited  (HSL).  HDBFSL  is  a 
leading  NBFC  that  caters  primarily  to  segments  not  covered 
by the Bank while HSL is among India’s largest retail broking 
firms. The financial results of the subsidiaries are prepared in 
accordance with notified Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind-AS’) 
with effect from April 1, 2018 (April 1, 2017 being the transition 
date).  Accordingly,  the  financial  results  for  the  comparative 
reporting  period  have  also  been  prepared  in  accordance 
therewith.

The detailed financial performance of the companies is given 
below.

Transacting customers of HSL
10.10 lakh

HDFC Securities Limited (HSL)
HSL’s  Total  Income  under  Indian  Accounting  Standards  was 
` 1,399.43 crore as against ` 862.26 crore in the previous year 
and Net Profit was ` 703.23 crore as against ` 384.15 crore in 
the previous year. The company has a customer base of 27.26 

lakh to whom it offers an exhaustive range of investment and 
protection products. In the year under review, HSL had 10.10 
lakh  (a  little  over  a  million)  transacting  customers.  The  focus 
on digitisation continued. Notably, 92 per cent of its customers 
accessed its services digitally, against 79 per cent in the previous 
year. 

In a conscious effort to rationalise the distribution network with 
greater  emphasis  on  digital  offerings,  HSL  consolidated  its 
existing branches to end with 216 branches across 159 cities/
towns at the end of the year. It created Digital Boarding Journeys 
which led to more than 50% customers being onboarded digitally.

In the case of Margin Trade Funding (MTF), the average book 
size during the year was ` 932 crore, which is 71% higher than 
the average book size of ` 544 crore in the last financial year. 
The  book  size  at  the  year  end  stands  at  `  1,680  crore.  The 
stock markets started FY 2020-21 with pessimism and ended 
with optimism. An important indicator of this has been the Nifty 
50’s sharp swing from 8,473 in March 2020 to 14,720 by the 
end of the year. This resulted in HSL’s improved performance. 
The benchmark index Nifty rose 73% whereas the Sensex rose 
68% over this year. Digitisation, along with the vaccination drive, 
the various stimulus packages and the FY 2021-22 Budget have 
added to investor confidence in the markets.

As on March 31, 2021, your Bank held 96.34% stake in HSL.

Compliance with Secretarial Standards

The  Bank  is  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  Secretarial 

Standards as notified from time to time.

Statutory Auditors

The Bank’s current Statutory Auditors are MSKA & Associates, 

Chartered Accountants. MSKA & Associates were appointed 

as Statutory Auditor of the Bank, to hold office for a period of 

four consecutive years from the conclusion of the 25th AGM of 

the Bank held on July 12, 2019, till the conclusion of the 28th 

AGM to be held for the Financial Year 2022-23, subject to the 

approval of the Reserve Bank of India. Pursuant to the Guidelines

Auditors (SAs) of Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs), UCBs 

and NBFCs (including HFCs) dated April 27, 2021 issued by the 

Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI Guidelines’), banks may appoint the 

SCAs/SAs for a continuous period of three years. Since MSKA 

& Associates have already completed two years as Statutory 

Auditors of the Bank for FY 2019-20 and FY 2020-21, they may 

continue as Statutory Auditor for one more year, i.e. FY 2021-22, 

subject to the approval of the RBI. Accordingly, the Bank needs 

tenure of four years w.e.f FY 2019-20 till FY 2022-23 as earlier 

approved by the shareholders.

Further, the RBI Guidelines mandate that for banks with asset 

size  of  `15,000  crore  and  above  as  at  the  end  of  previous 

year,  the  statutory  audit  should  be  conducted  under  joint 

audit of a minimum of two audit firms. Accordingly, the Bank 

needs  to  appoint  minimum  of  two  joint  statutory  auditors  as 

per RBI guidelines. Accordingly, the Board of Directors, on the 

recommendation  of  the  Audit  Committee,  has  finalized  and 

recommended to RBI for approval, the name of M. M. Nissim 

& Co. LLP, Chartered Accountants (ICAI Firm Registration No. 

107122W/W100672)  as  the  first  preferred  firm  to  act  as  joint 

Statutory Auditors of the Bank for a period of three years from FY 

2021-22 till FY 2023-24, subject to approval of the shareholders 

at the ensuing AGM and subject to RBI approval for each year 

of their tenure. This firm shall act as the joint Statutory Auditors 

of the Bank along with MSKA & Associates for FY 2021-22 and 

thereafter act as joint Statutory Auditors of the Bank with such 

other new joint Statutory Auditor(s) who will be appointed by 

the Bank subject to prior permission of RBI and approval of the 

Members of the Bank from FY 2022-23 onwards. 

Appropriate resolutions in this regard are also being proposed 

at the ensuing AGM.

Whistle Blower Policy / Vigil Mechanism
The  Bank  encourages  an  open  and  transparent  system  of 
working and dealing amongst its stakeholders. While the Bank’s 
‘Code of Conduct & Ethics Policy’ directs employees to uphold 
Bank values and conduct business worldwide with integrity and 
highest ethical standards, the Bank has also adopted a ‘Whistle 
Blower Policy’ which encompasses a comprehensive framework 
of managing complaints of every stakeholder. It encourages its 
employees and various stakeholders to raise concerns about 
illegal / unethical behaviour observed in the Bank, compromise/ 
violation of Bank’s Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy or legal 
or regulatory provisions, corruption, misuse of office, criminal 
offences,  actual  or  suspected  fraud  and  other  malpractices 
detrimental to the interest of the Bank without any fear of reprisal, 
discrimination, harassment or victimization of any kind. 

The  policy  also  covers  reporting  of  instances  of  leakage/
suspected leakage of unpublished price sensitive information 
which  are  in  violation  to  SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading) 
Regulations and the Share Dealing Code of the Bank.

150

All such concerns/ complaints are received by the Chief of Internal 
Vigilance of the Bank and/or by the Whistle Blower Committee 
through  a  dedicated  email  ID  mapped  to  the  Whistle  Blower 
Committee members or by way of letter addressed to the Chief 
of Internal Vigilance of the Bank. Such complaints can also be 
filed directly by the employee in the internal Information Portal of 
the Bank. In case the whistle blower wishes to raise a complaint 
directly to the members of the Audit Committee of the Board 
(ACB), and not through above mentioned normal channels, the 
complaint may be directly made to the Chairperson of the ACB.

All such complaints are enquired into by the appropriate authority 
within the Bank while ensuring confidentiality of the identity of 
such  complainants.  On  the  basis  of  their  investigation,  if  the 
allegations  are  proved  to  be  correct,  then  the  Competent 
Authority  shall  recommend  to  the  appropriate  Disciplinary 
Authority to take suitable action against the responsible official 
and  corrective  measures  in  consultation  with  the  concerned 
stakeholders. The decision of the Whistle  Blower  Committee 
is final and binding on all. Other actions/measures considered 
necessary to prevent/ curb recurrence of events are also taken 
by the Competent Authority.

Details of whistle blower complaints received and subsequent 
action  taken  and  the  functioning  of  the  Whistle  Blower 
mechanism are reviewed periodically by the ACB. No person 
has been denied access to the ACB. During the financial year 
2020-21, a total of 86 such complaints were received and taken 
up for investigation of which 56 whistle blower complaints were 
resolved as of March 31, 2021. Further, 21 cases have resulted in 
certain staff actions post investigation. The broad categories of 
whistle blower complaints were in the areas of improper business 
practices, behavioural related issues and corruption related.

Bank  at  the  link-  https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/about-

Securities Class Action Suit
On September 3, 2020, a securities class action lawsuit was filed 
against the Bank and certain of its current and former officers in 
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New 
York. The complaint was amended on February 8, 2021. The 
amended complaint alleges that the Bank, its former Managing 
Director,  Mr.  Aditya  Puri,  and  the  present  Managing  Director 
&  CEO,  Mr.  Sashidhar  Jagdishan  made  materially  false  and 
misleading statements regarding certain aspects of the Bank’s 
business and compliance policies, which resulted in the Bank’s 
American  Depository  Share  price  declining  on  July  13,  2020 
thereby allegedly causing damage to the Bank’s investors. The 
Bank believes that the asserted claims are baseless and without 
merit and intends to vigorously defend against the allegations.

Statement  on  Declaration  by  Independent 
Directors
Mr.  Malay  Patel,  Mr.  Umesh  Chandra  Sarangi,  Mr.  Sanjiv 
Sachar, Mr. M. D. Ranganath and Mr. Sandeep Parekh are the 
Independent Directors whereas Dr. (Ms). Sunita Maheshwari is

Chakraborty  as  the  Part  Time  Non-Executive  Chairman  and 
Additional  Independent  Director  of  the  Bank  with  effect  from 
May 5, 2021.   

Pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Section  149  of  the  Act,  the 
Independent Directors have submitted declarations that each 
of them meet the criteria of independence as provided in Section 
149(6)  of  the  Act  along  with  Rules  framed  thereunder  and 
Regulation 16(1)(b) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015. There has been no change in the circumstances affecting 
their status as Independent Directors of the Bank. In the opinion 
of the Board, the Independent Directors possess the requisite 
integrity, experience, expertise and proficiency required under 
all applicable laws and the policies of the Bank.  

In  compliance  with  Sections  149  and  152  of  the  Companies 
Act,  2013,  Mr.  Umesh  Chandra  Sarangi  is  proposed  to  be  
re-appointed  as  an  Independent  Director  of  the  Bank  at 
the  ensuing  Annual  General  Meeting.  A  resolution  seeking 
shareholders’ approval for his re-appointment forms a part of 
the Notice of this AGM. A brief resume is furnished in the report 
on Corporate Governance for the information of shareholders.

Board Performance Evaluation
The  Bank’s  Board  of  Directors,  led  by  the  Nomination  and 
Remuneration  Committee  (NRC),  invited  an  independent 
third-party global leadership advisory firm to conduct a Board 
effectiveness review to monitor and enhance its performance, 
and reinforce a culture of high performance in the boardroom.  

The  review  focused  on  two  sides  of  the  ‘governance’  coin: 
processes and behaviors. In particular, the areas of review for the 
Board included Board structure and composition; relationships & 
dynamics on the Board; meetings, information flows and agenda; 
strategy and  business  performance;  talent management  and 
succession planning; risk management, regulatory compliance, 
governance practices and continuous development. 

The  Committees  review  focused  on  areas  including  overall 
effectiveness, Committee composition and succession planning, 
clarity of remit and delegated authority, balance of agenda items 
between the Committee and the Board and clarity and action 
items reported by the Committee to the Board. 

in listening and receiving feedback, ability to challenge and take 
tough decisions etc.

The review made use of both an online structured questionnaire 
and follow-up 1-1 individual director interviews. Key executives 
from the management team also lent their perspective on their 
interactions and experience with the Board through additional 
conversations.  The  findings  on  the  Board’s  current  practices 
were benchmarked with global best-in-class organizations. 

The review findings recognized the functional expertise of the 
Board members, functioning of the key Committees, Board’s 
detail-oriented approach and effectiveness of Board’s oversight 
on critical matters. The culture of cohesiveness, integrity, trust 
and transparent decision-making at the Board was also noted. 
Some areas of focus for Board going forward included increasing 
time dedicated to strategic topics, bringing a holistic enterprise 
wide approach to risk management and succession planning.

The  findings  of  the  exercise  were  reviewed  by  the  NRC, 
Independent Directors and the Board. The appropriate feedback 
was  conveyed  to  the  Board  members  and  other  concerned 
stakeholders, for suitable action.

Since Dr. (Ms.) Sunita Maheshwari was appointed on the Board 
with  effect  from  March  30,  2021,  she  had  not  attended  any 
Board meeting held in FY 2020-21 and thus did not participate 
in the Board performance evaluation for FY 2020-21. Similarly, 
Mr. Atanu Chakraborty was appointed as the Part Time Non-
Executive Chairman and Additional Independent Director of the 
Bank with effect from May 5, 2021 and thus did not participate 
in the Board performance evaluation for FY 2020-21.

Introduction to 

Our 

Policy is aligned to business strategy, market dynamics, internal 
characteristics and complexities within the Bank. The ultimate 
objective is to provide a fair and transparent structure that helps 
the Bank to retain and acquire the talent pool critical to building 
competitive advantage and brand equity.

Your  Bank’s  approach  is  to  have  a  “pay  for  performance” 
culture based on the belief that the Performance Management 
System  provides  a  sound  basis  for  assessing  performance 
holistically.  The  compensation  system  should  also  take  into 
account factors such as roles, skills / competencies, experience 
and grade / seniority to differentiate pay appropriately on the 
basis of contribution, skill and availability of talent on account 
of competitive market forces. The details of the Compensation 
Policy are also included in Note No. 26 of Schedule 18 forming 
part of the Financial Statements. 

Non-Executive Directors are paid remuneration by way of sitting 
fees for attending meetings of the Board and its Committees, 
which  are  determined  by  the  Board  based  on  applicable 
regulatory prescriptions. 

Further,  expenses  incurred  by  them  for  attending  meetings 
of  the  Board  and  Committees  in  person  are  reimbursed  at 
actuals. Pursuant to the relevant RBI guidelines and approval of 
the shareholders, the Non-Executive Directors, other than the 
Chairman,  are  paid  profit-related  commission  of  `  1,000,000

Conclusion
It has clearly been the year of the pandemic. While the country 
had  barely  come  out  of  the  first  wave,  the  more  dangerous 
second wave struck posing fresh challenges for the global and 
the  Indian  economy.  The  presence  of  the  vaccine  is  a  clear 
source of comfort but there are challenges around its supply. The 
proactive measures taken by the Union Government like allowing 
imports is expected to ease the situation. As is the decision to go 
in for a centralised vaccination procurement and free distribution 
of vaccines to everyone above the age of 18. 

Notwithstanding  these  challenges  the  Indian  economy  is 
expected to be among the fastest growing ones in the world.    
Perhaps not as fast as projected earlier. The Union Government’s 
decision to put growth ahead of fiscal consolidation is another 
positive. 

Your Bank of course cannot remain entirely unaffected by these 
developments.  It  has  certain  factors  in  its  favour  :  A  strong 
balance sheet with among the lowest NPA levels in the industry, 
a  franchise  that  inspires  trust  and  capitalisation  levels  that 
exceed regulatory norms. This means it can continue lending 
as well as innovate. While there have challenges when it comes 
to technology, your Bank has initiated both short term as well as 
long term measures to overcome these. 

The biggest opportunity is of course the under penetration of 
banking  services  in  the  country.  Changing  global  dynamics 
means that countries are increasingly trying to diversify and do  
not want want to put all their eggs in the China basket. India is 
well positioned to capitalise on this opportunity. Your Bank is also 
expected to benefit from these developments. 

It will however not abandon the core principles of its journey of 
over a quarter century. As always it will blend its quest for growth 
with caution so that there is no undue stress on the balance 
sheet.  The  five  core  values  :  Customer  Focus,  Operational 
Excellence,  Product  Leadership,  People  and  Sustainability 
will continue to guide us in this story. As we continue to ‘Lead 
Responsibly’.

v. Where the company has calculated the employee compensation cost 

Had  the  Bank  followed  fair  value  method  for  accounting,  the 

using the intrinsic value of the stock options, the difference between 

stock option compensation expense would have been higher by 

the  employee  compensation  cost  so  computed  and  the  employee 

` 1,117.0 crore. Consequently profit after tax would have been 

compensation cost that shall have been recognized if it had used the

A description of the method and significant assumptions used during 

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has prescribed

two methods to account for stock grants; (i) the intrinsic value 

including the following weighted average information:

method; (ii) the fair value method. The Bank adopts the intrinsic 

value method to account for the stock options it grants to the 

employees. The Bank also calculates the fair value of options at 

the time of grant, using binomial option-pricing model with the 

following assumptions

Independent Auditor’s Report

To the Members of HDFC Bank Limited

Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

Opinion 
We have audited the standalone financial statements of HDFC Bank Limited (“the Bank”), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 
March 31, 2021, the Profit and Loss Account, Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial 
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial 
statements give the information required by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well as the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in 
the manner so required for Banking Companies and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Bank as at March 31, 2021 and its profit and its cash flows for the year ended on 
that date.

Basis for Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (“the ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone 
financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 

Emphasis of Matter 
We draw attention to Note 43 of Schedule 18 to the standalone financial statements, which describes the extent to which the  
COVID-19  pandemic  will  continue  to  impact  the  Bank’s  standalone  financial  statements  will  depend  on  ongoing  and  future 
developments, which are highly uncertain. 

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. 

Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone 
financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

The  Bank  has  material  open  tax  litigations  including  matters  under 

Our Audit procedures with respect to this matter included:

dispute  which  involve  significant  judgement  to  determine  the 

possible outcome of these disputes.

Significant management judgement is needed in determining whether 

an obligation exists and whether a provision should be recognised as 

at the reporting date, in accordance with the accounting criteria set 

under  Accounting  Standard  29  -  Provisions,  Contingent  Liabilities 

and Contingent Assets (‘AS 29’), or whether it needs to be disclosed 

as	 a	 contingent	 liability.	 Further	 significant	 judgements	 are	 also	

involved in measuring such obligations, the most significant of which 

are:

•	 Assessment	of	liability:	Judgement	is	involved	in	the	determination	

Testing  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  the  Bank’s  key 

controls over the estimation, monitoring and disclosure of provisions 

and contingent liabilities.

Our substantive audit procedures included and were not limited to 

the following: 

•	 Obtained	an	understanding	of	the	Bank’s	process	for	determining	

tax liabilities, tax provisions and contingent liabilities pertaining to 

legal matters and taxation matters;

•	 Obtained	list	of	cases	/	matters	in	respect	of	which	litigations	were	

outstanding as at reporting date; 

of whether an outflow in respect of identified material matters are 

Ø	For	significant	legal	matters,	we	sought	external	confirmations	

probable and can be estimated reliably;

and  also  corroborated  with  management’s  documented 

conclusions  on  the  assessment  of  outstanding  litigations 

•	 Adequacy	of	provisions:	The	appropriateness	of	assumptions	and	

against the Bank;

judgements used in the estimation of significant provisions; and

The Bank’s assessment is supported by the facts of matter, their own 

relevant appellate authorities.

•	 Adequacy	 of	 disclosures	 of	 provision	 for	 liabilities	 and	 charges,	

and contingent liabilities.

judgement, experience, and advises from legal and independent tax 

consultants wherever considered necessary. 

Since  the  assessment  of  these  open  litigations  requires  significant 

level of judgement in interpretation of law, we have included this as 

a key audit matter.

Ø	For	significant	taxation	matters,	we	involved	our	tax	specialist	

to gain an understanding of the current status of the litigations, 

including understanding of various orders / notices received by 

the Bank and the management’s grounds of appeals before the 

•	 Evaluated	 the	 merit	 of	 the	 subject	 matter	 under	 consideration	

with  reference  to  the  grounds  presented  therein  and  available 

independent legal / tax advice; and

•	 Agreed	 underlying	 tax	 balances	 to	 supporting	 documentation,	

including correspondence with tax authorities.

Assessed the disclosures within the standalone financial statements 

in this regard.

The Reserve Bank of India’s (“RBI”) guidelines on Income recognition 
and asset classification (“IRAC”) prescribe the prudential norms for 
identification  and  classification  of  non-performing  assets  (“NPA”) 
and the minimum provision required for such assets.

The  Bank  is  required  to  have  Board  approved  policy  as  per  IRAC 
guidelines for NPA identification and provision. 

The  Bank  is  also  required  to  apply  its  judgement  to  determine  the 
identification  and  provision  required  against  NPAs  by  applying 
quantitative  as  well  as  qualitative  factors.  The  risk  of  identification 
of  NPAs  is  affected  by  factors  like  stress  and  liquidity  concerns  in 
certain sectors. 

The provision on NPA is estimated based on ageing and classification 
of  NPAs,  recovery  estimates,  nature  of  loan  product,  value  of 
security and other qualitative factors and is subject to the minimum 
provisioning norms specified by RBI and approved policy of the Bank 
in this regard. 

Additionally,  the  Bank  makes  provisions  on  exposures  that  are 
not  classified  as  NPAs  including  advances  in  certain  sectors  and 
identified advances or group advances that can potentially slip into 
NPA. These are classiﬁed as contingency provisions.

The management of the Bank also made an assessment of the impact 
on borrowers’ account due to COVID-19 pandemic and in line with 
the COVID-19 Regulatory Package announced by the RBI in respect 
of  moratorium  and  restructuring  of  advances  as  relief  measures  to 
the borrowers. 

Additionally, the Bank has considered the impact of judegment, on 
identification of NPA and provision thereof, which was vacated as per 
Honourable  Supreme  Court  Order  on  March  23,  2021  and  the  RBI 
circular dated April 7, 2021 in that connection.

Since  the  identification  of  NPAs  and  provisioning  for  advances 
require  significant  level  of  estimation  and  given  its  significance  to 
the overall audit including possible observation by RBI which could 
result into disclosure in the financial statements, we have ascertained 
identification and provisioning for NPAs as a key audit matter.

Tested  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  key  controls 
(including application controls) over approval, recording, monitoring 
and  recovery  of  loans,  monitoring  overdue  /  stressed  accounts, 
identification of NPA, provision for NPA and valuation of security and 
collateral. 

Testing of Application controls include testing of automated controls, 
reports and system reconciliations.

Evaluated  the  governance  process  and  review  controls  over 
calculations  of  provision  of  non-performing  advances,  basis  of 
provisioning in accordance with the Board approved policy.

Selected  the  borrowers  based  on  quantitative  and  qualitative  risk 
factors  for  their  assessment  of  appropriate  classification  as  NPA 
including  computation  of  overdue  ageing  to  assess  its  correct 
classification  and  provision  amount  as  per  extant  IRAC  norms  and  
the Bank policy. 

Performed other substantive procedures included and not limited to 
the following:

•	Selected	samples	of	performing	loans	and	assessed	independently	

as to whether those should be classified as NPA;

•	For	 samples	 selected	 reviewed	 the	 collateral	 valuation,	 financial	

statements and other qualitative information;

•	Considered	the	accounts	reported	by	the	Bank	and	other	Banks	as	
Special Mention Accounts (“SMA”) in RBI’s Central Repository of 
Information on Large Credits (CRILC) to identify stress;

•	For	 selected	 samples	 assessed	 independently	 accounts	 that	 can	

potentially	be	classified	as	NPA	and	Red	Flagged	Accounts;

•	Performed	 inquiries	 with	 the	 credit	 and	 risk	 departments	 to	
ascertain if there were indicators of stress or an occurrence of an 
event of default in a particular loan account or any product category 
which needed to be considered as NPA;

•	Examined	 the	 early	 warning	 reports	 generated	 by	 the	 Bank	 to	

identify stressed loan accounts; 

•	Held	 specific	 discussions	 with	 the	 management	 of	 the	 Bank	 on	
sectors where there is perceived credit risk and the steps taken to 
mitigate the risks to identified sectors;

•	Selected	 samples	 for	 standard	 accounts,	 default	 but	 standard	
accounts  and  overdue  accounts  and  assessed  compliance  with 
RBI circular on COVID-19 Regulatory Package;

•	Selected	and	tested	samples	of	accounts	which	were	restructured	
under	MSME	restructuring	circular	and	Resolution	Framework	for	
COVID-19 related stress circular for their compliance with the RBI 
directions; and

•	Selected	 samples	 of	 accounts	 which	 were	 not	 declared	 as	 NPA	
due  to  the  interim  order  of  Honourable  Supreme  Court  and  later 
on  due  to  the  vacation  of  the  interim  order  and  the  RBI  circular 
in  that  connection  to  ensure  the  asset  classification  of  borrower 
accounts has been continued as per the extant RBI instructions / 
IRAC norms.

Assessed  the  adequacy  of  disclosures  against  the  relevant 
accounting standards and RBI requirements relating to NPAs.

The  reliability  and  security  of  IT  systems  plays  a  key  role  in  the 
business operations of the Bank. Since large volume of transactions 
are  processed  daily,  the  IT  controls  are  required  to  ensure  that 
applications process data as expected and that changes are made 
in an appropriate manner.  

Appropriate IT general controls and application controls are required 
to  ensure  that  such  IT  systems  are  able  to  process  the  data, 
as  required,  completely,  accurately  and  consistently  for  reliable 
financial reporting. 

We  have  identified  ‘IT  systems  and  controls’  as  key  audit  matter 
because of the high level automation, significant number of systems 
being  used  by  the  management  and  the  complexity  of  the  IT 
architecture and its impact on the financial reporting system. 

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our Audit procedures with respect to this matter included:

Key  IT  audit  procedures  includes  testing  design  and  operating 
effectiveness of  key controls operating over user access management 
(which  includes  user  access  provisioning,  de-provisioning,  access 
review,  password  configuration  review,    segregation  of  duties  and 
privilege access), change management (which include change release 
in production environment are compliant to the defined procedures 
and segregation of environment  is ensured), program development 
(which include review of data migration activity),  computer operations 
(which includes testing of key controls pertaining to, backup, Batch 
processing  (including  interface  testing),  incident  management  and 
data centre security), System interface controls. This included testing 
that  requests  for  access  to  systems  were  appropriately  logged, 
reviewed  and  authorized.  Also,  entity  level  controls  pertaining  to 
policy and procedure and Business continuity plan assessment due 
impact of COVID-19 was also part of our audit procedure.

In addition to the above, the design and operating effectiveness of 
certain  automated  controls,  that  were  considered  as  key  internal 
system controls over financial reporting were tested. Using various 
techniques  such  as  inquiry,  review  of  documentation  /  record  /
reports,  observation  and  re-performance.  We  also  tested  few 
controls  using  negative  testing  technique.  We  had  taken  adequate 
samples of instances for our test.  

Tested compensating controls and performed alternate procedures, 
where  necessary.  In  addition,  understood  where  relevant,  changes 
made to the IT landscape during the audit period.  

Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information in the Basel 
III - Pillar 3 disclosures and graphical representation of financial highlights (but does not include the financial statements and our 
auditor’s reports thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, and Annual Report, which is expected to 
be made available to us after that date. 

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to Those Charged with Governance.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for Standalone Financial Statements 
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance and cash 
flows of the Bank in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards 
specified under Section 133 of the Act and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and circulars, guidelines and directions issued by the 
Reserve Bank of India from time to time (the “RBI Guidelines”) as applicable to Bank. This responsibility also includes maintenance 
of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the RBI Guidelines for safeguarding of the assets 
of the Bank and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process. 

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
standalone financial statements. 

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout 
the audit. We also:
(cid:116)(cid:1) (cid:42)(cid:69)(cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:74)(cid:71)(cid:90)(cid:1)(cid:66)(cid:79)(cid:69)(cid:1)(cid:66)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:70)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:1)(cid:85)(cid:73)(cid:70)(cid:1)(cid:83)(cid:74)(cid:84)(cid:76)(cid:84)(cid:1)(cid:80)(cid:71)(cid:1)(cid:78)(cid:66)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:83)(cid:74)(cid:66)(cid:77)(cid:1)(cid:78)(cid:74)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:85)(cid:66)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:78)(cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:1)(cid:80)(cid:71)(cid:1)(cid:85)(cid:73)(cid:70)(cid:1)(cid:253)(cid:79)(cid:66)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:66)(cid:77)(cid:1)(cid:84)(cid:85)(cid:66)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:78)(cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:84)(cid:13)(cid:1)(cid:88)(cid:73)(cid:70)(cid:85)(cid:73)(cid:70)(cid:83)(cid:1)(cid:69)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:1)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:1)(cid:71)(cid:83)(cid:66)(cid:86)(cid:69)(cid:1)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:1)(cid:70)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:13)(cid:1)(cid:69)(cid:70)(cid:84)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:1)(cid:66)(cid:79)(cid:69)(cid:1)
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Bank has 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our Auditor’s Report. However, future

and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

 We also provide Those Charged with Governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with Those Charged with Governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the standalone financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2021 and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our Auditor’s Report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of 
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion
In our opinion, the Bank has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and 
such internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2021, based on 
the internal control with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note.

Annexure A to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date on the Standalone 
Financial Statements of HDFC Bank Limited 
[Referred to in paragraph 3(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent Auditor’s Report of 
even date to the Members of HDFC Bank Limited on the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2021] 

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of HDFC Bank Limited (“the Bank”) as of March 
31, 2021 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control 
with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI) (the “Guidance Note”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including 
adherence to Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed 
to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether internal financial controls with reference to financial statements was established and maintained and if 
such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With reference to Financial Statements
A Bank’s internal financial control with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s internal financial control with reference to financial statements includes 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
Bank; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition 
of the Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

levels.  Specific  loan  loss  provisions  in  respect  of  non-
performing advances are charged to the Profit and Loss 
Account and included under Provisions and Contingencies.

Non-performing advances are written-off in accordance 
with  the  Bank’s  policies.  Recoveries  from  bad  debts 
written-off are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account 
and included under other income. 

In relation to non-performing derivative contracts, as per 
the extant RBI guidelines, the Bank makes provision for the 
entire amount of overdue and future receivables relating 
to positive marked to market value of the said derivative 
contracts.

The Bank maintains general provision for standard assets 
including credit exposures computed as per the current 
marked  to  market  values  of  interest  rate  and  foreign 
exchange derivative contracts and gold in accordance with 
the guidelines and at levels stipulated by RBI from time to 
time. In the case of overseas branches, general provision 
on standard advances is maintained at the higher of the 
levels stipulated by the respective overseas regulator or 
RBI. Provision for standard assets is included under other 
liabilities.

Provisions  made  in  addition  to  the  Bank’s  policy  for 
specific loan loss provisions for non-performing assets and 
regulatory general provisions are categorised as floating 
provisions. Creation of floating provisions is considered by 
the Bank up to a level approved by the Board of Directors. 
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, floating provisions 
are  used  up  to  a  level  approved  by  the  Board  only  for 
contingencies under extraordinary circumstances and for 
making specific provisions for impaired accounts as per 
these guidelines or any regulatory guidance / instructions. 
Floating provisions are included under other liabilities.

Further  to  the  provisions  required  to  be  held  according 
to the asset classification status, provisions are held for 
individual country exposures (other than for home country 
exposure). Countries are categorised into risk categories 
as per Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. 
(‘ECGC’) guidelines and provisioning is done in respect of 
that country where the net funded exposure is one percent 
or more of the Bank’s total assets. Provision for country risk 
is included under other liabilities.

In  addition  to  the  above,  the  Bank  on  a  prudent  basis 
makes provisions on advances or exposures which are not 
NPAs, but has reasons to believe on the basis of the extant 
environment  or  specific  information  or  basis  regulatory 
guidance / instructions, of a possible slippage of a specific 
advance or a group of advances or exposures or potential 
exposures. These are classified as contingent provisions 
and included under other liabilities.  

The Bank considers a restructured account as one where 
the  Bank,  for  economic  or  legal  reasons  relating  to  the 
borrower’s  financial  difficulty,  grants  to  the  borrower 
concessions that the Bank would not otherwise consider. 
Restructuring would normally involve modification of terms 
of the advance / securities, which would generally include, 
among others, alteration of repayment period / repayable 
amount / the amount of instalments / rate of interest (due 
to reasons other than competitive reasons). Restructured 
accounts  are  classified  as  such  by  the  Bank  only  upon 
approval and implementation of the restructuring package. 
Restructuring of an account is done at a borrower level. 

In accordance with the RBI guidelines on the prudential 
framework  for  resolution  of  stressed  assets  and  the 
resolution framework for COVID-19 related stress, the Bank 
in accordance with its Board approved policy, carried out 
one-time  restructuring  of  eligible  borrowers.  The  asset 
classification and necessary provisions thereon are done 
in accordance with the said RBI guidelines.

3  Securitisation and transfer of assets

Assets  transferred  through  securitisation  and  direct 
assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the Balance 
Sheet when they are sold (true sale criteria being fully met 
with) and consideration is received by the Bank. Sales / 
transfers that do not meet these criteria for surrender of 
control are accounted for as borrowings. In accordance 
with RBI guidelines, the Bank amortises any profit received 
for a securitisation or direct assignment transaction based 
on the method prescribed and any loss arising therefrom 
is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account at the time of 
sale.

The  Bank  transfers  advances  through  inter-bank 
participation  with  and  without  risk.  In  accordance  with 
the RBI guidelines, in the case of participation with risk, 
the aggregate amount of the participation issued by the 
Bank is reduced from advances and where the Bank is 
participating,  the  aggregate  amount  of  the  participation 
is classified under advances. In the case of participation 
without risk, the aggregate amount of participation issued 
by the Bank is classified under borrowings and where the 
Bank is participating, the aggregate amount of participation 
is shown as due from banks under advances.

In  accordance  with  RBI  guidelines  on  sale  of  non-
performing advances, if the sale is at a price below the 
net book value (i.e., book value less provisions held), the 
shortfall is charged to the Profit and Loss Account and if 
the sale is for a value higher than the net book value, the 
excess provision is credited to the Profit and Loss Account 
in the year the amounts are received.

In respect of stressed assets sold by the Bank under an 
asset securitisation, where the investment by the bank in

Schedules to the Financial Statements 

For the year ended March 31, 2021 

security receipts (SRs) backed by the assets sold by it is 
more  than  10  percent  of  such  SRs,  in  accordance  with 
RBI guidelines, provisions held are higher of the provisions 
required  in  terms  of  net  asset  value  declared  by  the 
Securitisation Company (‘SC’) / Reconstruction Company 
(‘RC’) and provisions as per the extant norms applicable to 
the underlying loans, notionally treating the book value of 
these SRs as the corresponding stressed loans assuming 
the loans remained in the books of the Bank.

The  Bank  invests  in  Pass  Through  Certificates  (PTCs) 
issued by other Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). These 
are accounted for at the deal value and are classified as 
investments. The Bank also buys loans through the direct 
assignment route which are classified as advances. These 
are carried at acquisition cost unless it is more than the 
face value, in which case the premium is amortised over 
the tenor of the loans.

4  Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLCs)

The Bank enters into transactions for the sale or purchase 
of Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLCs). In the case 
of a sale transaction, the Bank sells the fulfilment of priority 
sector obligation and in the case of a purchase transaction 
the Bank buys the fulfilment of priority sector obligation 
through RBI trading platform. There is no transfer of risks 
or loan assets. The fee received for the sale of PSLCs is 
recorded as miscellaneous income and the fee paid for 
purchase of the PSLCs is recorded as other expenditure 
in Profit and Loss Account. These are amortised over the 
period of the Certificate.

5  Fixed assets and depreciation

Fixed  assets  are  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated 
depreciation  as  adjusted  for  impairment,  if  any.  Cost 
includes  cost  of  purchase  and  all  expenditure  like  site 
preparation,  installation  costs  and  professional  fees 
incurred on the asset before it is ready to use. Subsequent 
expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised 
only  when  it  increases  the  future  benefit  /  functioning 
capability from / of such assets. 

Depreciation is charged over the estimated useful life of 
the fixed asset on a straight-line basis. The management 
believes  that  the  useful  life  of  assets  assessed  by  the 
Bank, pursuant to Part C of Schedule II to the Companies 
Act,  2013,  taking  into  account  changes  in  environment, 
changes in technology, the utility and efficacy of the asset 
in use, fairly reflects its estimate of useful lives of the fixed 
assets. The estimated useful lives of key fixed assets are

10  Employee benefits

Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOS):
The  Employee  Stock  Option  Scheme  (‘the  Scheme’) 
provides for the grant of options to acquire equity shares 
of the Bank to its employees and whole time directors. The 
options  granted  to  employees  vest  in  a  graded  manner 
and  these  may  be  exercised  by  the  employees  within  a 
specified period. 

The  Bank  follows  the  intrinsic  value  method  to  account 
for  its  stock-based  employee  compensation  plans. 
Compensation cost is measured by the excess, if any, of 
the market price of the underlying stock over the exercise 
price  as  determined  under  the  option  plan.  The  market 
price is the closing price on the stock exchange where there 
is highest trading volume on the working day immediately 
preceding the date of grant. Compensation cost, if any is 
amortised over the vesting period.

Gratuity:
The  Bank  has  an  obligation  towards  gratuity,  a  defined 
benefit  retirement  plan  covering  all  eligible  employees. 
The  plan  benefit  vests  upon  completion  of  five  years  of 
service and is in the form of lump sum amount, without an 
upper limit, equivalent to 15 days’ basic salary payable for 
each completed year of service to all eligible employees on 
resignation, retirement, death while in employment or on 
termination of employment. The Bank makes contributions 
to a recognized Gratuity Trust administered by trustees and 
whose  funds  are  managed  by  insurance  companies.  In 
respect of erstwhile Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) employees, 
the Bank makes contribution to a fund set up by eLKB and 
administered by the Board of Trustees. 

The  defined  gratuity  benefit  plans  are  valued  by  an 
independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet date using 
the projected unit credit method as per the requirement of 
AS-15, Employee Benefits, to determine the present value 
of the  defined  benefit obligation and the related service 
costs.  The  actuarial  calculations  entails  assumptions 
about  demographics,  early  retirement,  salary  increases 
and interest rates. Actuarial gain or loss is recognised in 
the Profit and Loss Account.

Superannuation:
The  Bank  has  a  Superannuation  Plan  under  which 
employees  of  the  Bank,  above  a  prescribed  grade,  are 
entitled to receive retirement benefits either through salary 
or under a defined contribution plan. For those opting for 
a defined contribution plan, the Bank contributes a sum 
equivalent to 13% of the employee’s eligible annual basic 
salary  (15%  for  the  whole  time  directors  and  for  certain 

210

eligible  employees  of  the  erstwhile  Centurion  Bank  of 
Punjab (eCBoP) staff) to a Trust administered by trustees 
and whose funds are managed by insurance companies. 
The Bank has no liability towards future superannuation 
fund benefits other than its contribution, and recognises 
such contribution as an expense in the year incurred.

Provident fund:
The Bank is covered under the Employees Provident Fund 
and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and accordingly 
all employees of the Bank are entitled to receive benefits 
under the provident fund. The Bank contributes an amount, 
on a monthly basis, at a determined rate (currently 12% 
of employee’s basic salary). Of this, the Bank contributes 
an amount equal to 8.33% of employee’s basic salary up 
to a maximum salary level of ` 15,000/- per month, to the 
Pension Scheme administered by the Regional Provident 
Fund Office. The balance amount of the 12% employer’s 
share is contributed to an exempted Trust set up by the 
Bank and administered by a Board of Trustees. The Bank 
recognises such contributions as an expense in the year 
in which it is incurred. 

Interest payable to the members of the exempted trust shall 
not be lower than the statutory rate of interest declared by 
the Central Government under the Employees Provident 
Funds  and  Miscellaneous  Provisions  Act,  1952  and 
shortfall, if any, shall be made good by the Bank.

The  guidance  note  on  implementing  AS-15,  Employee 
Benefits, states that benefits involving employer established 
provident  funds,  which  require  interest  shortfalls  to  be 
provided, are to be considered as defined benefit plans. 
Actuarial valuation of this Provident Fund interest shortfall 
is done as per the guidance note issued in this respect by 
The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) and provision towards 
this liability is made.

The overseas branches of the Bank make contribution to the 
respective applicable government social security scheme 
calculated  as  a  percentage  of  the  employees’  salaries. 
The Bank’s obligations are limited to these contributions, 
which are expensed when due, as such contribution is in 
the nature of defined contribution.

Leave encashment:
The  Bank  has  a  policy  of  encashing  unavailed  leave  for 
eLKB  employees  under  Indian  Banks’  Association  (IBA) 
structure. The Bank provides for leave encashment  based 
on an independent actuarial valuation at the Balance Sheet 
date, which includes assumptions about demographics, 
early retirement, salary increases, interest rates and leave 
utilisation.

Statutory Reports and  
Financial Statements

Pension:
In respect of pension payable to certain eLKB employees 
under IBA structure, which is a defined benefit scheme, 
the  Bank  contributes  10%  of  basic  salary  to  a  pension 
trust set up by the Bank and administered by the Board 
of Trustees and an additional amount towards the liability 
shortfall based on an independent actuarial valuation as 
at the Balance Sheet date, which includes assumptions 
about  demographics,  early  retirement,  salary  increases 
and interest rates.

In respect of certain eLKB employees who had moved to 
a Cost to Company (CTC) based compensation structure 
and  had  completed  less  than  15  years  of  service,  the 
contribution which was made until then, is maintained as a 
fund and will be converted into annuity on separation after a 
lock-in-period of two years. For this category of employees, 
liability stands frozen and no additional provision is required 
except for interest as applicable to Provident Fund, which 
is provided for.

In  respect  of  certain  eLKB  employees  who  moved  to  a 
CTC structure and had completed service of more than 
15  years,  pension  would  be  paid  on  separation  based 
on  salary  applicable  as  on  the  date  of  movement  to 
CTC  structure.  Provision  thereto  is  made  based  on  an 
independent actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet 
date.

New Pension Scheme (NPS):
In respect of employees who opt for contribution to the 
NPS, the Bank contributes certain percentage of the basic 
salary of employees to the aforesaid scheme, a defined 
contribution plan, which is managed and administered by 
pension fund management companies. The Bank has no 
liability other  than  its  contribution, and  recognises  such 
contributions as an expense in the year incurred.

11  Debit and credit cards reward points

The  Bank  estimates  the  probable  redemption  of  debit 
and credit card reward points and cost per point using an 
actuarial method by employing an independent actuary, 
which includes assumptions such as mortality, redemption 
and  spends.  Provisions  for  liabilities  on  the  outstanding 
reward points are made based on an independent actuarial 
valuation  as  at  the  Balance  Sheet  date  and  included  in 
other liabilities and provisions.

12  Bullion

The Bank imports bullion including precious metal bars on 
a consignment basis. The imports are typically on a back-
to-back basis and are priced to the customer based on 
the price quoted by the supplier. The difference between 
the  price  recovered  from  customers  and  cost  of  bullion 
is  accounted  at  the  time  of  sale  to  the  customers  and 
reported as ‘‘Other Income’’.

The Bank also deals in bullion on a borrowing and lending 
basis  and  the  interest  thereon  is  accounted  as  interest 
expense / income respectively.

13  Lease accounting

Lease payments including cost escalation for assets taken 
on operating lease are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account  over  the  lease  term  on  a  straight-line  basis  in 
accordance with the AS-19, Leases. 

14 

Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current tax provision (i.e. 
the amount of tax for the period determined in accordance 
with  the  Income  Tax  Act,  1961,  the  rules  framed  there 
under and considering the material principles set out in 
Income Computation and Disclosure Standards) and the 
net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the 
year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for 
the future tax consequences of timing differences between 
the  carrying  values  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their 
respective tax bases, and operating loss carried forward, 
if any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates as at the 
Balance Sheet date. 

Current tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are off-set when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority, when the Bank has 
a legal right to off-set and when the Bank intends to settle 
on a net basis.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there 
is  reasonable  certainty  that  the  assets  can  be  realised 
in future. In case of unabsorbed depreciation or carried 
forward loss under taxation laws, deferred tax assets are 
recognised  only  if  there  is  virtual  certainty  of  realisation 
of such assets. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date and appropriately adjusted to reflect 
the  amount  that  is  reasonably  /  virtually  certain  to  be 
realised.

15  Earnings per share

The Bank reports basic and diluted earnings per equity 
share in accordance with AS-20, Earnings per Share. Basic 
earnings per equity share has been computed by dividing 
net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential 
dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to 
issue equity shares were exercised or converted to equity 
during  the  year.  Diluted  earnings  per  equity  share  are 
computed using the weighted average number of equity 
shares and the dilutive potential equity shares outstanding 
during the period except where the results are anti-dilutive.

18  Accounting for provisions, contingent  

liabilities and contingent assets
In accordance with AS-29, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities 
and Contingent Assets, the Bank recognises provisions 
when it has a present obligation as a result of a past event, 
it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and when a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
can be made. 

Provisions are determined based on management estimate 
required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date, 
supplemented by experience of similar transactions. These 
are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to 
reflect the current management estimates.

A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is:

existence of which will be confirmed by the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future 
events not within the control of the Bank; or

Contingent assets, if any, are not recognised in the financial 
statements  since  this  may  result  in  the  recognition  of 
income that may never be realised.

Onerous contracts
Provisions  for  onerous  contracts  are  recognised  when 
the expected benefits to be derived by the Bank from a 
contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting 
the future obligations under the contract. The provision is 
measured at the present value of the lower of the expected 
cost  of  terminating  the  contract  and  the  expected  net 
cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is 
established, the Bank recognises any impairment loss on 
the assets associated with that contract.

19  Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and gold in hand, 
balances with RBI, balances with other banks and money 
at call and short notice.

20  Corporate social responsibility

1.  Proposed dividend

Amounts in notes forming part of the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2021 are denominated in rupee crore to 

conform to extant RBI guidelines, except where stated otherwise.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), vide notification dated December 04, 2020, stated that in view of the ongoing stress and 

heightened uncertainty on account of COVID-19, banks should continue to conserve capital to support the economy and absorb 

losses. The notification also stated that in order to further strengthen the banks’ balance sheets, while at the same time support 

lending to the real economy, banks shall not make any dividend payment on equity shares from the profits pertaining to the 

financial year ended March 31, 2020. The Bank did not declare final dividend for the financial year ended March 31, 2020.

Given that the current “second wave” has significantly increased the number of COVID-19 cases in India and uncertainty 

remains, the Board of Directors of the Bank, at its meeting held on April 17, 2021, has considered it prudent to currently not 

propose dividend for the financial year ended March 31, 2021. The Board shall reassess the position based on any further 

guidelines from the RBI in this regard.

2.  Special Dividend

` 1,646.95 crore inclusive of tax on dividend.

3.  Sub-division of Equity Shares

During the previous year ended March 31, 2020 the Bank had paid Special Interim Dividend of ` 5 per equity share of face 

value of ` 2 each (pre-split) for the financial year 2019-20, to commemorate 25 years of the Bank’s operation, aggregating to 

During the previous year ended March 31, 2020, the shareholders of the Bank at the 25th Annual General Meeting held on July 

12, 2019 approved sub-division (split) of one equity share of the Bank from face value of ` 2/- each into two equity shares of

Basic earnings per equity share of the Bank has been computed by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per equity share 
has been computed by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding during the year, except where the results are anti-
dilutive. The dilutive impact is on account of stock options granted to employees by the Bank. There is no impact of dilution 
on the profits in the current year and previous year.

8.  Accounting for employee share based payments

The shareholders of the Bank approved the grant of equity share options under Plan “C” in June 2005, Plan “D” in June 2007, 
Plan “E” in June 2010, Plan “F” in June 2013 and Plan “G” in July 2016. Under the terms of each of these Plans, the Bank may 
issue to its employees and Whole Time Directors, Equity Stock Options (‘ESOPs’) each of which is convertible into one equity 
share. All the plans were framed in accordance with the SEBI (Employee Stock Option Scheme & Employee Stock Purchase 
Scheme) Guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and as applicable at the time of the grant. The accounting for the stock 
options has been in accordance with the SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014 to the extent applicable.

Plans C, D, E, F and G provide for the issuance of options at the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee of the Board (‘NRC’) at the closing price on the working day immediately preceding the date when options are 
granted. This closing price is the closing price of the Bank’s equity share on an Indian stock exchange with the highest trading 
volume as of the working day preceding the date of grant.

The vesting conditions applicable to the options are at the discretion of the NRC. These options are exercisable on vesting, 
for a period as set forth by the NRC at the time of the grant. The period in which the options may be exercised cannot exceed 
five years from date of expiry of vesting period. During the years ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, no modifications 
were made to the terms and conditions of ESOPs.

Fair value methodology
The fair value of options used to compute the proforma net profit and earnings per equity share have been estimated on 
the dates of each grant using the binomial option-pricing model. The Bank estimates the volatility based on the historical 
prices of its equity shares. The Bank granted 5,74,66,600 options during the year ended March 31, 2021 (previous year: 
4,77,73,600). The various assumptions considered in the pricing model for the ESOPs granted during the year ended 
March 31, 2021 are:

10.  Unhedged foreign currency exposure

The Bank has in place a policy and process for managing currency induced credit risk. The credit appraisal memorandum 
prepared at the time of origination and review of a credit facility is required to discuss the exchange risk that the customer 
is exposed to from all sources, including trade related, foreign currency borrowings and external commercial borrowings. It 
could cover the natural hedge available to the customer as well as other hedging methods adopted by the customer to mitigate 
exchange risk. For foreign currency loans granted by the Bank beyond a defined threshold the customer is encouraged to 
enter into appropriate risk hedging mechanisms with the Bank. Alternatively, the Bank satisfies itself that the customer has 
the financial capacity to bear the exchange risk in the normal course of its business and / or has other mitigants to reduce the 
risk. On a monthly basis, the Bank reviews information on the unhedged portion of foreign currency exposures of customers, 
whose total foreign currency exposure with the Bank exceeds a defined threshold. Based on the monthly review, the Bank 
proposes suitable hedging techniques to the customer to contain the risk. A Board approved credit risk rating linked limit on 
unhedged foreign currency position of customers is applicable when extending credit facilities to a customer. The compliance 
with the limit is assessed by estimating the extent of drop in a customer’s annual Earnings Before Interest and Depreciation 
(‘EBID’) due to a potentially large adverse movement in exchange rate impacting the unhedged foreign currency exposure of 
the customer. Where a breach is observed in such a simulation, the customer is advised to reduce its unhedged exposure.

In accordance with RBI guidelines, as at March 31, 2021 the Bank holds standard asset provisions of ` 230.31 crore (previous 
year: ` 129.95 crore) and maintains capital (including CCB & D-SIB) of ` 918.77 crore (previous year: ` 574.13 crore) in respect 
of the unhedged foreign currency exposure of its customers.

Overview of business and processes
Derivatives are financial instruments whose characteristics are derived from underlying assets, or from interest rates, 
exchange  rates  or  indices.  These  include  forwards,  swaps,  futures  and  options.  The  notional  amounts  of  financial 
instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with the instruments 
recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current 
fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. The following 
sections outline the nature and terms of the derivative transactions generally undertaken by the Bank.

Interest rate contracts 
Forward rate agreements give the buyer the ability to determine the underlying rate of interest for a specified period 
commencing on a specified future date (the settlement date). The underlying rate of interest could be an interest rate curve, 
interest rate index or bond yield. There is no exchange of principal and settlement is effected on the settlement date. The 
settlement amount is the difference between the contracted rate and the market rate prevailing on the settlement date 
discounted for the interest period of the agreement.

Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of interest obligations with the counterparty for a specified period without 
exchanging the underlying (or notional) principal.

Schedules to the Financial Statements 

For the year ended March 31, 2021 

Interest rate caps and floors give the buyer the ability to fix the maximum or minimum rate of interest. The writer of the 
contract pays the amount by which the market rate exceeds or is less than the cap rate or the floor rate respectively. 
A combination of interest rate caps and floors can create structures such as interest rate collar, cap spreads and floor 
spreads.

Interest rate futures are standardised interest rate derivative contracts traded on a recognised stock exchange to buy 
or sell a notional security or any other interest bearing instrument or an index of such instruments or interest rates at a 
specified future date, at a price determined at the time of the contract.

Exchange rate contracts
Forward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell fixed amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange 
on future date. These instruments are carried at fair value, determined based on either FEDAI rates or market quotations.

Cross  currency  swaps  are  agreements  to  exchange  principal  amounts  denominated  in  different  currencies.  Cross 
currency swaps may also involve the exchange of interest payments on one specified currency for interest payments in 
another specified currency for a specified period.

Currency options (including Exchange Traded Currency Option) give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right but 
not an obligation, to buy or sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future 
date.

Currency futures contract is a standardised contract traded on an exchange, to buy or sell a certain underlying currency at 
a certain date in the future, at a specified price. The contract specifies the rate of exchange between one unit of currency 
with another.

The Bank’s derivative transactions relate to sales and trading activities. Sale activities include the structuring and marketing 
of derivatives to customers to enable them to hedge their market risks (both interest rate and exchange risks), within the 
regulatory framework as applicable from time to time. The Bank deals in derivatives on its own account (trading activity) 
principally for the purpose of generating a profit from short term fluctuations in price yields or implied volatility. The Bank 
also deals in derivatives to hedge the risk embedded in some of its Balance Sheet assets or liabilities.

Constituents involved in derivative business
The Treasury front-office enters into derivative transactions with customers and inter-bank counterparties. The Bank 
has an independent back-office and mid-office as per regulatory guidelines. The Bank has credit risk and market risk 
departments  that  assesses  various  counterparty  credit  risk  and  market  risk  limits,  within  the  risk  architecture  and 
processes of the Bank.

Derivative policy
The Bank has in place a Derivative Policy which covers various aspects that apply to the functioning of the derivative 
business. The derivative business is administered through various market risk limits such as position limits, tenor limits, 
sensitivity limits, scenario based profit and loss limit for option portfolio, stop loss trigger levels and value-at-risk limits 
that are recommended by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (‘RPMC’) to the Board of Directors for approval. 
All methodologies used to assess market and credit risks for derivative transactions are specified by the credit risk and 
market risk units. Limits are monitored on a daily basis by the mid-office.

The Bank has implemented a Board approved policy on Customer Suitability & Appropriateness, which forms part of 
the Derivative Policy, to ensure that derivative transactions entered into are appropriate and suitable to the customer’s 
nature of business / operations. Before entering into a derivative deal with a customer, the Bank scores the customer 
on various risk parameters and based on the overall score level it determines the kind of product that best suits its risk

Introduction to 

Our 

Hedging policy

For derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments, the Bank documents, at inception of the hedge, the relationship 

between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge and 

the methods used to assess the hedge effectiveness. Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of inception of the 

hedge and periodically thereafter. Hedge effectiveness is measured by the degree to which changes in the fair value or 

cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows 

of the hedging instrument.

The hedging book consists of transactions to hedge Balance Sheet assets or liabilities. The tenor of hedging instrument 

may be less than or equal to the tenor of underlying hedged asset or liability. Derivative contracts designated as hedges 

in an effective hedge relationship, are not marked to market unless their underlying asset or liability is marked to market. 

In respect of derivative contracts that are marked to market, changes in the market value are recognised in the Profit 

and Loss Account in the relevant period. Gain or losses arising from hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is recognised in the 

Profit and Loss Account. Foreign exchange forward contracts not intended for trading, that are entered into to establish 

the amount of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the 

Balance Sheet date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate. The premia or discount arising at the inception of such 

forward exchange contract is amortised as expense or income over the life of the contract.

The Bank enters into derivative transactions with counter parties based on their business ranking and financial position.

 The Bank sets up appropriate limits upon evaluating the ability of the counterparty to honour its obligations in the event 

of crystallisation of the exposure. Appropriate credit covenants are stipulated where required, as trigger events to call for 

collaterals or terminate a transaction and contain the risk.

The Bank, at the minimum, conforms to the RBI guidelines with regard to provisioning requirements. Overdue receivables 

representing crystallised positive mark-to-market value of a derivative contract are transferred to the account of the 

borrower and treated as non-performing assets, if these remain unpaid for 90 days or more. Full provision is made for the 

entire amount of overdue and future receivables relating to positive marked to market value of non-performing derivative

For the year ended March 31, 2021 

(cid:57)  As at March 31, 2021, the notional principal amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts classified as trading 
amounted to ` 496,472.67 crore (previous year: ` 607,919.49 crore). There were no foreign exchange contracts 
classified as hedging outstanding as at March 31, 2021 (previous year: Nil).

The notional principal amounts of derivatives reflect the volume of transactions outstanding as at the Balance Sheet 
date and do not represent the amounts at risk.

For the purpose of this disclosure, currency derivatives include currency options purchased and sold and cross 
currency swaps.

For the purpose of this disclosure, interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and 
interest rate caps and floors.

The Bank has computed the maximum and minimum of PV01 for the year based on the balances as at the end of 
every month.

In  respect  of  derivative  contracts,  the  Bank  evaluates  the  credit  exposure  arising  there  from,  in  line  with  RBI 
guidelines. Credit exposure has been computed using the current exposure method which is the sum of:

(a) 

(b) 

the current replacement cost (marked to market value including accruals) of the contract or zero whichever is 
higher; and

the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) is a product of the notional principal amount of the contract and a factor 
that is based on the grid of credit conversion factors prescribed in RBI guidelines, which is applied on the basis 
of the residual maturity and the type of contract.

Anr), vide an interim order dated September 03, 2020 (“Interim Order”), had directed banks that accounts which were not 
declared NPA till August 31, 2020 shall not be declared as NPA till further orders. Accordingly, the Bank did not classify 
any account which was not NPA as of August 31, 2020 as per the RBI IRAC norms, as NPA after August 31, 2020.

In terms of the RBI guidelines, banks are required to disclose the divergence in asset classification and provisioning 
consequent to RBI’s annual supervisory process in their notes to accounts to the financial statements, wherever the 
additional provisioning assessed / additional gross NPAs identified by RBI exceeds the threshold specified by RBI. The 
threshold for provisioning is 10 per cent of the reported profit before provisions and contingencies for the reference period 
and that for additional gross NPAs is 15 per cent of the published incremental Gross NPAs for the reference period.

There was no divergence in asset classification and provisioning for NPAs for the year ended March 31, 2020.

Brief description

1 Claims against the Bank not 

The Bank is a party to various taxation matters in respect of which appeals are pending. 

acknowledged as debts - taxation

The Bank expects the outcome of the appeals to be favorable based on decisions on 

similar issues in the previous years by the appellate authorities, based on the facts of the 

case and taxation laws.

2 Claims against the Bank not 

The Bank is a party to various legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The 

acknowledged as debts - others

Bank  does  not  expect  the  outcome  of  these  proceedings  to  have  a  material  adverse 

effect on the Bank’s financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows.

3 Liability on account of forward 

The  Bank  enters  into  foreign  exchange  contracts,  currency  options,  forward  rate 

exchange and derivative contracts

agreements,  currency  swaps  and  interest  rate  swaps  with  inter-bank  participants  on 

its own account and for customers. Forward exchange contracts are commitments to 

buy  or  sell  foreign  currency  at  a  future  date  at  the  contracted  rate.  Currency  swaps 

are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest / principal in one currency 

against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest rate swaps are commitments to 

exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. The notional amounts of financial 

instruments  such  as  foreign  exchange  contracts  and  derivatives  provide  a  basis  for 

comparison with instruments recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily 

indicate  the  amounts  of  future  cash  flows  involved  or  the  current  fair  value  of  the 

instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. 

The  derivative  instruments  become  favorable  (assets)  or  unfavorable  (liabilities)  as  a 

result of fluctuations in market rates or prices relative to their terms.

As a part of its commercial banking activities, the Bank issues documentary credit and 
guarantees  on  behalf  of  its  customers.  Documentary  credits  such  as  letters  of  credit

failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations.
These  include:  a)  Credit  enhancements  in  respect  of  securitised-out  loans;  b)  Bills 
rediscounted  by  the  Bank;  c)  Capital  commitments;  d)  Underwriting  commitments;  e) 
Investment  purchases  pending  settlement;  f)  Amount  transferred  to  the  RBI  under  the

Provident fund
The guidance note on AS-15, Employee Benefits, states that employer established provident funds, where interest is guaranteed 
are to be considered as defined benefit plans and the liability has to be valued. The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) has issued 
a guidance note on valuation of interest rate guarantees on exempt provident funds. The actuary has accordingly valued the 
same and the Bank held a provision of Nil as at March 31, 2021 (previous year: Nil), towards the present value of the guaranteed 
interest benefit obligation. The actuary has followed the deterministic approach as prescribed by the guidance note.

contributions of the Bank and / or relevant line of business in any year. Under the malus clause the 

incumbent foregoes the payout of the deferred variable pay in full or in part. Under the claw back clause 

the incumbent is obligated to return all the tranches of payout received of bonus amounts pertaining to 

the relevant performance year. The deferred bonus is paid out post review and approval by the NRC.

The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the business 

unit, performance of the individual employee, job band of the employee and the functional category. 

Basis these key determinants and due adjustment for risk alignment, a payout matrix for variable pay is 

developed. Market trends for specific businesses / functions along with inputs from compensation surveys 

may also be used in finalising the payout.

Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in both 

the quantum and the method of payout across functions. Typically higher levels of responsibility receive 

a higher proportion of variable pay vis-à-vis fixed pay. The Bank ensures that the time horizon for risk is 

assessed and the deferment period, if any, for bonus is set accordingly. The following is taken into account 

while administering the annual bonus:

(cid:57) 

In the event the proportion of variable pay exceeds 50% of fixed pay for employees in certain grades, 

the Bank has devised the following deferment schedule after taking into consideration the nature of 

risk, time horizon of risk, and the materiality of risk.

In cases of deferment of variable pay, the Bank makes an assessment prior to the due date for 
payment of the deferred portion for any negative contribution. The criteria for negative contribution 
are decided basis pre-defined financial benchmarks. The Bank has in place appropriate methods for 
prevention of vesting of deferred variable pay or any part thereof, on account of negative contribution. 
The Bank also has in place claw back arrangements in relation to amounts already paid in the 
eventuality of a negative contribution.

PLPs are formulated for sales personnel who are given sales targets but have limited impact on risk since 
credit decisions are exercised independent of the sales function. All PLP payouts are based on a balanced 
scorecard framework which factors not just quantitative, but also qualitative measures, such as quality 
of business sourced, customer complaints etc., and are subject to achievement of individual targets 
enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till 
the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks. Employees who are on the 
PLPs are excluded from the Annual Bonus Plan.

c)  Guaranteed Bonus

Guaranteed bonuses are not consistent with sound risk management or pay for performance principles of the 
Bank and therefore do not form an integral part of the general compensation practice.

For critical hiring for some select strategic roles, the Bank may consider granting of bonus, based on the 
performance rating upon confirmation, as a prudent way to avoid loading the entire cost of attraction into the 
fixed component of the compensation which could have a long term cost implication for the Bank. For such 
hiring, the said bonus is generally decided by taking into account appropriate risk factors and market conditions.

For hiring at levels of Whole Time Directors / Managing Director and certain employees in select strategic roles, 
a sign-on bonus, if any, is limited to the first year only and is only in the form of Employee Stock Options.

d)  Employee Stock Option Plan (‘ESOP’s)

The Bank considers ESOPs as a vehicle to create a balance between short term rewards and long term 
sustainable value creation. ESOPs play a key role in the attraction and retention of key talent. The Bank grants 
equity share options to its Whole Time Directors and other employees above a certain grade. All plans for 
grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and 
are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the grant of options post approval by 
the NRC.

The NRC grants options after considering parameters such as the incumbent’s grade and performance rating, 
and such other factors as may be deemed appropriate by the NRC. Equity share options granted to the Whole 
Time Directors are also subject to the approval of the NRC, the Board of Directors of the Bank and the RBI.

The Bank grants ESOPs to eligible employees. Such ESOPs vest over four tranches spread over a period of 
48 months. The ESOPs granted subsequent to April 1, 2019 vest no faster than on a pro rata basis.

e)  Severance Pay

The Bank does not grant severance pay other than accrued benefits (such as gratuity, pension) except in cases 
where it is mandated by any statute.

f)  Hedging

The Bank does not provide any facility or fund or permit its Whole Time Directors and employees to insure 
or hedge their compensation structure to offset the risk alignment effects embedded in their compensation 
arrangement.

g)  Statutory Bonus

Some employees are also paid statutory bonus as per the Payment of Bonus Act (1965) as amended from time 
to time.

III.  Remuneration Processes 
Fitment at the time of Hire
Pay scales at the Bank are set basis the job size, experience, location and the academic and professional credentials 
of the incumbent.

The compensation of new hires is in line with the existing pay ranges and consistent with the compensation levels of 
the existing employees of the Bank at similar profiles. The pay ranges are subject to change basis market trends and 
the Bank’s talent management priorities. While the Bank believes in the internal equity and parity as a key determinant 
of pay, it does acknowledge the external competitive pressures of the talent market. Accordingly, there could be 
certain key profiles with critical competencies which may be hired at a premium and treated as an exception to the 
overall pay philosophy. Any deviation from the defined pay ranges is treated as a hiring exception requiring approval 
with appropriate justification.

The Bank strives to ensure external competitiveness as well as internal equity without diluting the overall focus on 
optimising cost. In order to enhance the Bank’s external competitiveness, it participates in an annual salary survey of 
the banking sector to understand key market trends as well as get insights on relative market pay position compared 
to peers. The Bank endeavors to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of 
fixed pay over time. This coupled with key internal data indicators like performance score, job family, experience, 
job grade and salary budget form the basis of decision making on revisions in fixed pay.

Increments in fixed pay for majority of the employee population are generally undertaken once every financial year. 
However, promotions, confirmations and change in job dimensions could also lead to a change in the fixed pay 
during other times of the financial year.

The Bank also makes salary corrections and adjustments during the financial year for competitive pay positioning of those 
employees who have a good performance track record. However, such pay revisions are done on an exception basis.

Risk, Control and Compliance Staff
The Bank has separated the Risk, Control and Compliance functions from the Business functions in order to create a 
strong culture of checks and balances and to eliminate any possible conflict of interest between revenue generation 
and risk management and control. Accordingly, the overall variable pay as well as the annual salary increment of the 
employees in the Risk, Control and Compliance functions is based on their performance, functional objectives and 
goals. The Bank ensures that the mix of fixed to variable compensation for these functions is weighted in favour of 
fixed compensation.

C.  Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into account in the remuneration  
processes, including the nature and type of the key measures used to take account of these risks
The Bank takes into account various types of risks in its remuneration processes. The Bank follows a comprehensive 
framework that includes within its ambit the key dimensions of remuneration such as fixed pay, variable pay and long 
term incentives (i.e. Employee Stock Options).

Fixed pay: The Bank conducts a comprehensive market benchmarking study to ensure that employees are competitively 
positioned in terms of fixed pay. The Bank follows a robust salary review process wherein revisions in fixed compensation 
are  based  on  performance.  The  Bank  also  makes  salary  adjustments  taking  into  consideration  pay  positioning  of 
employees vis-à-vis market reference points. Through this approach the Bank endeavors to ensure that the talent risk due 
to attrition is mitigated. Fixed pay could be revised downwards as well, in the event of certain proven cases of misconduct 
by an employee.

Variable pay: The Bank has distinct types of variable pay plans as given below:
(a)  Quarterly / monthly performance-linked pay (PLP) plans:

All quarterly / monthly PLP plans are based on the principle of balanced scorecard framework that includes within 
its ambit both quantitative and qualitative factors including key strategic objectives that ensure future competitive 
advantage for the Bank. PLP plans, by design, have deterrents that play a role of moderating payouts based on the 
non-fulfillment of established quantitative / qualitative risk factors. Deterrents also include risks arising out of non-
compliance, mis-sell etc. Further, a portion of all payouts under the PLP plans is deferred till the end of the financial 
year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks. Employees who are part of the PLP plans are excluded from 
the Annual Bonus Plan.

(b)  Annual bonus plan:

The Bank takes into consideration the fact that a portion of the Bank’s profits are directly attributable to various 
types of risks the Bank is exposed to such as credit risk, market risk, operational risk and other quantifiable risks.

While the above parameters form the core evaluation parameters for the Bank and the remuneration of its Whole Time 

Directors, each of the business units are measured on the following from a remuneration standpoint:

The framework developed by the Bank in order to arrive at the quantum of bonus pool is based on the performance 
of the Bank and profitability. The annual bonus is distributed based on business unit and individual performance and 
job band and role of the individual for non-business functions. The business unit performance is based on factors 
such as growth in revenue, growth in profit, cost to income ratio and achievement vis-à-vis plans and key objectives. 
Bonus pay out for an individual employee in a particular grade is linked to the performance rating of the employee 
and subject to meeting the Bank’s standards of ethical conduct.

The Bank has devised appropriate malus and claw back clauses as a risk mitigant for any negative contributions of 
the Bank and / or relevant line of business in any year for Whole Time Directors and employees in certain grades. 
Under the malus clause the incumbent foregoes the vesting of the deferred variable pay in full or in part. Under the 
claw back clause the incumbent is obligated to return all the tranches of bonus payout pertaining to the reference 
performance year. The deferred bonus is paid out post review and approval by the NRC.

The bonus for Whole Time Directors is capped at 70% of the fixed pay in a year. The variable pay for Whole Time 
Directors is approved by the NRC as well as the Board of Directors of the Bank and is subject to the approval of the 
RBI.

The variable pay component for Whole time Directors and employees in certain grades is paid out subject to the 
following conditions:

Where the variable pay constitutes 50% or more of the fixed pay, a portion of the same would be deferred as per 
the schedule mentioned in the table below:

Timelines

Basis the performance of the business unit, individual performance and role, the Bank has formulated the following 

60% Payable in the financial year immediately following the performance year.

13.33% Payable in the second financial year following the reference performance year.

13.33% Payable in the third financial year following the reference performance year.

13.33% Payable in the fourth financial year following the reference performance year.

(c)  Long term incentives (employee stock options):

The Bank also grants employee stock options to employees in certain job bands. The grant is based on performance 
rating of the individual.

D.  Description  of  the  ways  in  which  the  Bank  seeks  to  link  performance  during  a  performance  
  measurement period with levels of remuneration

The Bank has a robust performance management system for evaluating the performance of its Whole Time Directors. 
The performance appraisal system is based on a Balanced Scorecard Framework and considers qualitative as well as 
quantitative factors of performance which includes the following parameters:
1.  Business Performance -  This includes business growth, profitability, asset quality and shareholder value
2.  Stakeholder Relationship - This includes net promoter score and corporate social responsibility
3.  Audit and Compliance - This includes internal audit reports and compliance with the regulations and inspection 

reports

4.  Digital Transformation - This includes performance on initiatives required to run the bank and grow the bank
5.  Organizational Excellence  - This includes succession planning and employee engagement

corrections. These are based on a combination of performance rating, job band and the functional category of the 

individual employee. For a given job band, the merit increment is directly related to the performance rating. The Bank 

strives to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of fixed pay over time. All other 

things remaining equal, the correction percentage is directly related to the performance rating of the individual.

Whole Time Directors
The bonus for Whole Time Directors does not exceed 70% of the fixed pay in a year, thereby ensuring that there is a 
balance between the fixed and variable pay. The variable pay for Whole Time Directors is approved by the NRC as well 
as the Board and is subject to the approval of the RBI. The variable pay component is paid out subject to the following 
conditions:

the Bank and / or relevant line of business in any year.
(cid:57)  Malus clause

Under the malus clause the incumbent foregoes the vesting of the deferred variable pay in full or in part. In the 
event there is a deterioration in specific performance criteria (such as criteria relating to profit or asset quality) 
that are laid down by the NRC, then the NRC would review the deterioration in the performance taking into 
consideration the macroeconomic environment as well as internal performance indicators and accordingly 
decide whether any part of the deferred tranche pertaining to the reference financial year merits a withdrawal. 
The deferred bonus is paid out post review and approval by the NRC.

(cid:57)  Claw back clause

Under the claw back clause the incumbent is obligated to return all the tranches of payout received of bonus 
amounts pertaining to the relevant performance year. In the event there is any act attributable to the concerned 
Whole Time Director / Managing Director resulting in an incident of willful and deliberate misinterpretation / 
misreporting of financial performance (inflating the financials) of the Bank, for a financial year, which comes 
to light in the subsequent three years, the incumbent is obligated to return all the tranches of bonus payout 
received pertaining to the relevant performance year.

The specific criteria on the applicability of malus and claw back arrangements are reviewed by the NRC annually.

Employees other than Whole Time Directors
The Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans:
(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:34)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:86)(cid:66)(cid:77)(cid:1)(cid:67)(cid:80)(cid:79)(cid:86)(cid:84)(cid:1)(cid:81)(cid:77)(cid:66)(cid:79)
The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the individual employee, 
job band of the employee and the functional category. Basis these key determinants and due adjustment for risk 
alignment, a payout matrix for variable pay is developed. Market trends for specific businesses / functions along 
with inputs from compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the payout.

Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in both the quantum 
and the method of payout across functions. Typically higher levels of responsibility receive a higher proportion of 
variable pay vis-à-vis fixed pay. The Bank ensures that the time horizon for risk is assessed and the deferment period, 
if any, for bonus is set accordingly. Employees on the annual bonus plan are not part of the PLPs.

The following is taken into account while administering the annual bonus:

In the event the proportion of variable pay exceeds 50% of fixed pay, for employees in certain grades, the Bank 
has devised the following deferment schedule after taking into consideration the nature of risk, time horizon of

In cases of deferment of variable pay, the Bank makes an assessment prior to the due date for payment of 
the deferred portion for any negative contribution. The criteria for negative contribution are decided basis pre-
defined financial benchmarks. The Bank has in place appropriate methods for prevention of vesting of deferred 
variable pay or any part thereof, on account of negative contribution. The Bank also has in place claw back 
arrangements in relation to amounts already paid in the eventuality of a negative contribution.

PLPs are formulated for sales personnel who are given sales targets but have limited impact on risk since credit 
decisions are  exercised  independent  of  the  sales  function.  All PLP payouts  are subject to the achievement of 
individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred 
till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks.

F.  Description  of  the  different  forms  of  variable  remuneration  (i.e.  cash,  shares,  ESOPs  and  other  

(cid:1)

(cid:1)

(cid:1)

(cid:1)

forms) that the Bank utilises and the rationale for using these different forms
The Bank recognises the importance of variable pay in reinforcing a pay for performance culture. Variable pay stimulates 
employees to stretch their abilities to exceed expectations.
(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:34)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:86)(cid:66)(cid:77)(cid:1)(cid:67)(cid:80)(cid:79)(cid:86)(cid:84)(cid:1)(cid:81)(cid:77)(cid:66)(cid:79)
These are paid to reward performance for a given financial year. This covers all employees (excluding employees 
under PLPs). This is based on performance of the business unit, performance rating, job band and functional 
category of the individual. For higher job bands the proportion of variable pay to total compensation tends to be 
higher.

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:49)(cid:70)(cid:83)(cid:71)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:78)(cid:66)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:14)(cid:45)(cid:74)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:69)(cid:1)(cid:49)(cid:77)(cid:66)(cid:79)(cid:84)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:49)(cid:45)(cid:49)(cid:84)(cid:10)
These are paid to frontline sales staff for the achievement of specific sales targets but have limited impact on risk as 
credit decisions are exercised independent of the sales function. Further, it has been the endeavor of the Bank to 
ensure that the objectives set are based on the principles of a balanced scorecard that takes into account quantitative 
and qualitative measures rather than just the achievement of financial numbers. Further all PLPs have inherent risk 
adjustment mechanisms manifested in the form of deterrents. All PLP payouts are subject to the achievement of 
parameters, both qualitative and quantitative enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees. A portion 
of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks.

This is to reward for contribution of employees in creating a long term, sustainable earnings and enhancing shareholder 
value. Only employees in a certain job band and with a specific performance rating are eligible for stock options. 
Performance is the key criteria for granting stock options.

G.  Key changes to the Remuneration Policy pursuant to the revised guidelines on remuneration issued  

by the RBI on November 4, 2019
The design and structure of the remuneration at the Bank is in line with RBI guidelines as amended from time to time. The 
pay-out of variable pay for the reference performance financial year ended March 31, 2020 were in accordance with the 
RBI guidelines dated January 13, 2012. The payout of variable pay for the reference performance financial year ended 
March 31, 2021 will be undertaken in the financial year commencing on April 1, 2021 and will be in accordance with the 
RBI guidelines dated November 4, 2019.

Introduction to 

Our 

Given below are the key changes to the Remuneration Policy undertaken pursuant to the said revised guidelines on 
remuneration:
(a)  Material Risk Takers

The revised guidelines on remuneration provide direction with respect to the definition of material risk takers and 
specify the composition, limits, deferral and vesting of variable pay for the material risk takers.

(iv)  (cid:55)(cid:70)(cid:84)(cid:85)(cid:74)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:1)(cid:80)(cid:71)(cid:1)(cid:87)(cid:66)(cid:83)(cid:74)(cid:66)(cid:67)(cid:77)(cid:70)(cid:1)(cid:81)(cid:66)(cid:90)

The deferred portion of the remuneration vests at the end of deferral period and is spread over the course of 

the deferral period. The first vesting occurs at the end of one year from the commencement of the deferral 

period. The vesting is no faster than on a pro rata basis and the frequency of the vesting is not less than a year 

in order to ensure appropriate assessment of risk.

In accordance with the revised guidelines on remuneration, the Bank has identified material risk takers (MRTs) based 
on the standard qualitative and quantitative criteria as prescribed in the said guidelines.

(c)  (cid:46)(cid:66)(cid:77)(cid:86)(cid:84)(cid:1)(cid:16)(cid:1)(cid:36)(cid:77)(cid:66)(cid:88)(cid:67)(cid:66)(cid:68)(cid:76)(cid:1)(cid:34)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:66)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:78)(cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:85)

Standard qualitative criteria: Under the standard qualitative criteria, MRTs are to be identified based on the role 
and decision making power of staff members having jointly or individually, the authority to commit significantly to 
risk exposures etc. Accordingly, the Bank’s MRTs comprise its whole time directors, employees in the grades of 
Executive Vice President and above and select employees in the role of Business Heads and Treasury Desk Heads 
in grades Senior Vice President - II that fulfil the aforementioned qualitative criteria.

Under the standard quantitative criteria, the revised guidelines on remuneration permit banks to identify MRTs, inter 
alia, based on their total remuneration exceeding a threshold, the determination of which is to be done prudently by 
the respective banks. The Bank has fixed this threshold to be annual fixed pay of ` 0.80 crore.

Accordingly, all employees of the Bank who meet the aforementioned standard qualitative criteria and whose annual 
fixed pay equals or exceeds ` 0.80 crore are classified as MRTs with effect from April 1, 2020.

(b)  (cid:55)(cid:66)(cid:83)(cid:74)(cid:66)(cid:67)(cid:77)(cid:70)(cid:1)(cid:49)(cid:66)(cid:90)

In accordance with the requirements of the revised guidelines on remuneration, the following is the Bank’s policy 
on variable pay for its MRTs:
(i)  Composition of variable pay

The variable pay will be in the form of share linked instruments (such as ESOPs) or a mix of cash and share 
linked instruments. As per the said revised guidelines on remuneration, effective April 1, 2020 the share-linked 
instruments will be considered as part of variable pay. The Bank will ensure that there is a proper balance 
between cash and share linked instruments in the variable pay. In cases where compensation by way of 
share-linked instruments is not permitted by law / regulations, the entire variable pay will be in cash within the 
prescribed limits.

(ii)  Limits on variable pay

A substantial portion of the compensation i.e. at least 50% will be in variable pay and paid on the basis of 
the performance of the individual, the business unit and the organization. This is in line with the principle that 
at higher levels of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay is higher. The total variable pay is limited to a 
maximum of 300% of the fixed pay (for the relative performance period). As aforementioned, the variable pay 
will be inclusive of cash as well as share linked instruments.

In case the variable pay is up to 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay, and in the case 
of variable pay being above 200%, a minimum of 67% thereof, shall be via non-cash instruments.

In the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share-linked instruments, his /
her variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay.

(iii)  Deferral of variable pay

(d)  Employee stock options

For its MRTs, the Bank has in place deferral arrangements for the variable pay. A minimum of 60% of total 
variable pay will be under deferral arrangements. If the cash component is a part of the variable pay, at least 
50% of the cash bonus will be deferred. In cases where cash component of the bonus is under ` 0.25 crore, 
the deferral arrangements would not be necessary.

The deferral period is a minimum of three years and applicable to both cash and non-cash components of 
variable pay. The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs is governed by the ESOP Scheme Rules 
approved by the NRC and the Board.

Further, the malus and clawback conditions were reviewed by the NRC and the Board in light of the revised guidelines 

on remuneration. The following are the revised malus and clawback conditions governing all variable pay payouts 

for MRTs defined under the revised guidelines on remuneration applicable for variable pay and long term incentives 

(LTIs) pertaining to the performance year ended on March 31, 2021.

The Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking. The Bank, therefore, has 

devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment.

Malus Arrangement: The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout for the deferred 

portion of reward (variable pay / LTI)

Clawback Arrangement: The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward (variable 

pay / LTI) made in the previous years attributable to a given reference year wherein the incident has occurred.

The occurrence of any / some / all of the following conditions (illustrative) shall trigger a review by the NRC for the 

application of the malus or the clawback arrangement:

i. 

Substantial financial deterioration in profitability or risk parameters

ii.  Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior

iii. 

Fraud that requires a financial restatement

iv.  Reputational harm

v. 

Exposing the bank to substantial risk

vi.  Additional NRC defined conditions

As per the RBI guidelines on compensation, wherever the assessed divergence in a bank’s provisioning for Non-

Performing Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public disclosure, the bank 

shall not pay the unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment year under ‘malus’ arrangement. 

Further, in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for the assessment year) shall be entertained. 

In case the Bank’s post assessment Gross NPAs are less than 2.0%, these restrictions will apply only if criteria 

for public disclosure are triggered either on account of divergence in provisioning or both provisioning and asset 

classification.

The NRC may decide to apply malus on part, or all of the unvested deferred bonus amounts and LTIs. The time 

horizon for the application of malus / clawback clause is four years from the date of reward.

The NRC shall review the act of misconduct / incident to ascertain the degree of accountability attributable to a 

Whole Time Director / Material Risk Taker prior to applying the malus or clawback arrangement.

The criteria for malus / clawback arrangement shall be reviewed by the NRC annually.

The ESOPs that would be granted to MRTs in the financial year commencing on April 1, 2021, in respect of the 

reference performance financial year ended on March 31, 2021, shall be reckoned as part of their variable pay in 

accordance with the revised guidelines on remuneration.

27.  Segment reporting 
Business segments
Business segments have been identified and reported taking into account, the target customer profile, the nature of products 
and services, the differing risks and returns, the organisation structure, the internal business reporting system and the guidelines 
prescribed by RBI. The Bank operates in the following segments:

a)  Treasury

The treasury segment primarily consists of net interest earnings from the Bank’s investment portfolio, money market 
borrowing and lending, gains or losses on investment operations and on account of trading in foreign exchange and 
derivative contracts.

b)  Retail banking

The retail banking segment serves retail customers through the Bank’s branch network and other channels. This segment 
raises deposits from customers and provides loans and other services to customers with the help of specialist product 
groups. Exposures are classified under retail banking taking into account the status of the borrower (orientation criterion), 
the nature of product, granularity of the exposure and the quantum thereof.

Revenues of the retail banking segment are derived from interest earned on retail loans, interest earned from other 
segments for surplus funds placed with those segments, subvention received from dealers and manufacturers, fees from 
services rendered, foreign exchange earnings on retail products etc. Expenses of this segment primarily comprise interest 
expense on deposits, commission paid to retail assets sales agents, infrastructure and premises expenses for operating 
the branch network and other delivery channels, personnel costs, other direct overheads and allocated expenses of 
specialist product groups, processing units and support groups.

c)  Wholesale banking

The wholesale banking segment provides loans, non-fund facilities and transaction services to large corporates, emerging 
corporates, public sector units, government bodies, financial institutions and medium scale enterprises. Revenues of the 
wholesale banking segment consist of interest earned on loans made to customers, interest / fees earned on the cash 
float arising from transaction services, earnings from trade services and other non-fund facilities and also earnings from 
foreign exchange and derivative transactions on behalf of customers. The principal expenses of the segment consist of 
interest expense on funds borrowed from external sources and other internal segments, premises expenses, personnel 
costs, other direct overheads and allocated expenses of delivery channels, specialist product groups, processing units 
and support groups.

d)  Other banking business

This  segment  includes  income  from  parabanking  activities  such  as  credit  cards,  debit  cards,  third  party  product 
distribution, primary dealership business and the associated costs.

e)  Unallocated

All items which are reckoned at an enterprise level are classified under this segment. This includes capital and reserves, debt 
classified as Tier I or Tier II capital and other unallocable assets and liabilities such as deferred tax, prepaid expenses, etc.

Segment revenue includes earnings from external customers plus earnings from funds transferred to other segments. 
Segment result includes revenue less interest expense less operating expense and provisions, if any, for that segment. 
Segment-wise income and expenses include certain allocations. Interest income is charged by a segment that provides 
funding to another segment, based on yields benchmarked to an internally approved yield curve or at a certain agreed 
transfer price rate. Transaction charges are levied by the retail banking segment to the wholesale banking segment for 
the use by its customers of the retail banking segment’s branch network or other delivery channels. Segment capital 
employed represents the net assets in that segment.

Geographic segments
The  geographic  segments  of  the  Bank  are  categorised  as  domestic  operations  and  foreign  operations.  Domestic 
operations comprise branches in India and foreign operations comprise branches outside India.

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking sector. 
The objective of the LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks. It does this by ensuring 
that banks have an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be converted easily and 
immediately into cash to meet their liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The LCR is expected to 
improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus 
reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy.

The Liquidity Risk Management of the Bank is governed by the Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy approved by the 
Board. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision-making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest 
rate risk management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence to the risk 
tolerance / limits set by the Board. In order to determine cash outflows, the Bank segregates its deposits into various customer 
segments, viz Retail (which include deposits from individuals), Small Business Customers (those with deposits under ` 5 crore), 
and Wholesale (which would cover all residual deposits). Within Wholesale, deposits that are attributable to clearing, custody, 
and cash management services are classified as Operational Deposits. Other contractual funding, including a portion of other 
liabilities which are expected to run down in a 30 day time frame are included in the cash outflows. These classifications, based 
on extant regulatory guidelines, are part of the Bank’s LCR framework, and are also submitted to the RBI.

The LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank’s stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period. The 
guidelines for LCR were effective January 1, 2015, with the minimum requirement at 60% which would rise in equal annual 
steps to reach 100% on January 1, 2019. This graduated approach was designed to ensure that the LCR could be introduced 
without material disruption to the orderly strengthening of banking systems or the ongoing financing of economic activity. The 
present requirement, as on March 31, 2021 is 90% (As a measure to address the current pandemic situation, RBI had reduced 
the minimum LCR requirement from 100% to 80% which is to be gradually restored back in two phases, i.e., 90% by October 
1, 2020 and 100% by April 1, 2021)

In the Indian context, the run-off factors for the stressed scenarios are prescribed by the RBI, for various categories of liabilities 
(viz., deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), undrawn commitments, derivative-related exposures, and 
offset with inflows emanating from assets maturing within the same time period. Given below is a table of run-off factors and 
the average LCR maintained by the Bank quarter-wise over the past two years:

The impact of COVID-19, including changes in customer behaviour and pandemic fears, as well as restrictions on business and 
individual activities, has led to significant volatility in global and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease in global and 
local economic activities. The slowdown during the year led to a decrease in loan originations, the sale of third party products, 
the use of credit and debit cards by customers and the efficiency in collection efforts. This may lead to a rise in the number 
of customer defaults and consequently an increase in provisions thereagainst. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including the current “second wave” that has significantly increased the number of cases in India, will continue to impact the 
Bank’s results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, among other 
things, any new information concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and any action to contain its spread or mitigate 
its impact whether government-mandated or elected by us.

In accordance with the COVID-19 Regulatory Packages announced by the RBI on March 27, 2020, April 17, 2020 and May 23, 
2020, the Bank, in accordance with its board approved policy, offered a moratorium on the repayment of all instalments and 
/ or interest, as applicable, due between March 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020 to all eligible borrowers classified as standard, 
even if overdue, as on February 29, 2020. In respect of such accounts that were granted moratorium, the asset classification 
remained standstill during the moratorium period.

The disclosures as required by the RBI circular dated April 17, 2020 are given below: 

Particulars
Respective amounts in SMA / overdue categories, where the moratorium / deferment was extended, in terms 
of paragraph 2 and 3 of the circular (as of February 29,2020)

Cash Credit / Overdraft: ` 4,063.48 crore

44. Refund / adjustment of ‘interest on interest’

In accordance with the instructions in the paragraph 5 of the RBI circular dated April 07, 2021, the Bank shall refund / adjust 
‘interest on interest’ to all borrowers including those who had availed of working capital facilities during the moratorium 
period, irrespective of whether moratorium had been fully or partially availed, or not availed. Pursuant to these instructions,

Key Audit Matter

The  Bank  has  material  open  tax  litigations  including  matters  under 
dispute  which  involve  significant  judgement  to  determine  the 
possible outcome of these disputes.

Significant management judgement is needed in determining whether 
an obligation exists and whether a provision should be recognised as 
at the reporting date, in accordance with the accounting criteria set 
under  Accounting  Standard  29  -  Provisions,  Contingent  Liabilities 
and Contingent Assets (‘AS 29’), or whether it needs to be disclosed

and contingent liabilities.

The Bank’s assessment is supported by the facts of matter, their own 
judgement, experience, and advices from legal and independent tax 
consultants wherever considered necessary. 

Since the assessment of these open tax litigations requires significant 
level of judgement in interpretation of law, we have included this as 
a key audit matter.

The Reserve Bank of India’s (“RBI”) guidelines on Income recognition 
and asset classification (“IRAC”) prescribe the prudential norms for 
identification  and  classification  of  non-performing  assets  (“NPA”) 
and the minimum provision required for such assets.

The  Bank  is  required  to  have  Board  approved  policy  as  per  IRAC 
guidelines for NPA identification and provision. 

The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine the 
identification  and  provision  required  against  NPAs  by  applying 
quantitative as well as qualitative factors. The risk of identification 
of NPAs is affected by factors like stress and liquidity concerns in 
certain sectors. 

Tested  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  key  controls 
(including application controls) over approval, recording, monitoring 
and  recovery  of  loans,  monitoring  overdue  /  stressed  accounts, 
identification of NPA, provision for NPA and valuation of security and 
collateral. 

Testing of Application controls include testing of automated controls, 
reports and system reconciliations.

Evaluated  the  governance  process  and  review  controls  over 
calculations  of  provision  of  non-performing  advances,  basis  of 
provisioning approved in accordance with the Board approved policy.

is  estimated  based  on  ageing  and 
The  provision  on  NPA 
classification of NPAs, recovery estimates, nature of loan product, 
value of security and other qualitative factors and is subject to the 
minimum provisioning norms specified by RBI and approved policy 
of the Bank in this regard. 

Selected  the  borrowers  based  on  quantitative  and  qualitative  risk 
factors  for  their  assessment  of  appropriate  classification  as  NPA 
including  computation  of  overdue  ageing  to  assess  its  correct 
classification  and  provision  amount  as  per  extant  IRAC  norms  and 
Bank policy. 

Additionally,  the  Bank  makes  provisions  on  exposures  that  are 
not  classified  as  NPAs  including  advances  in  certain  sectors  and 
identified advances or group advances that can potentially slip into 
NPA. These are classiﬁed as contingency provisions.

The  Management  of  the  Bank  also  made  an  assessment  of  the 
impact  on  borrowers’  account  due  to  COVID-19  pandemic  and  in 
line with the COVID-19 Regulatory Package announced by the RBI 
in  respect  of  moratorium  and  restructuring  of  advances  as  relief 
measures to the borrowers. 

Additionally, the Bank has considered the impact of judgement, on 
identification  of  NPA  and  provision  thereof,  which  was  vacated  as 
per Honourable Supreme Court Order on March 23, 2021 and the 
RBI circular dated April 7, 2021 in that connection. 

Since  the  identification  of  NPAs  and  provisioning  for  advances 
require  significant  level  of  estimation  and  given  its  significance  to 
the overall audit including possible observation by RBI which could 
result into disclosure in the financial statements, we have ascertained 
identification and provisioning for NPAs as a key audit matter.

Introduction to 

Our 

Information Technology (“IT”) Systems and Controls 

Key Audit Matter

The  Bank  has  a  complex  IT  architecture  to  support  its  day-to-day 
business operations. High volume of transactions are processed and 
recorded on single or multiple applications.  

The  reliability  and  security  of  IT  systems  plays  a  key  role  in  the 
business operations of the Bank. Since large volume of transactions 
are  processed  daily,  the  IT  controls  are  required  to  ensure  that 
applications process data as expected and that changes are made in 
an appropriate manner.  

Appropriate IT general controls and application controls are required 
to  ensure  that  such  IT  systems  are  able  to  process  the  data,  as 
required, completely, accurately and consistently for reliable financial 
reporting. 

We  have  identified  ‘IT  systems  and  controls’  as  key  audit  matter 
because of the high level automation, significant number of systems 
being  used  by  the  management  and  the  complexity  of  the  IT 
architecture and its impact on the financial reporting system. 

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our Audit procedures with respect to this matter included:

(cid:39)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:1) (cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:84)(cid:85)(cid:74)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:1) (cid:85)(cid:73)(cid:70)(cid:1) (cid:42)(cid:53)(cid:1) (cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:70)(cid:83)(cid:66)(cid:77)(cid:1) (cid:68)(cid:80)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:80)(cid:77)(cid:84)(cid:13)(cid:1) (cid:66)(cid:81)(cid:81)(cid:77)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:66)(cid:85)(cid:74)(cid:80)(cid:79)(cid:1) (cid:68)(cid:80)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:80)(cid:77)(cid:84)(cid:1) (cid:66)(cid:79)(cid:69)(cid:1) (cid:42)(cid:53)(cid:1)
dependent  manual  controls,  we  involved  IT  specialists  as  part  of 
the  audit.  The  team  also  assisted  in  testing  the  accuracy  of  the 
information produced by the Bank’s IT systems. 

Obtained  a  comprehensive  understanding  of 
IT  applications  
landscape  implemented  at  the  Bank.  It  was  followed  by  process 
understanding,  mapping  of  applications 
the  same  and 
understanding  financial  risks  posed  by  people-process  and 
technology.  

to 

Key  IT  audit  procedures  includes  testing  design  and  operating 
effectiveness of  key controls operating over user access management 
(which  includes  user  access  provisioning,  de-provisioning,  access 
review,  password  configuration  review,    segregation  of  duties  and 
privilege access), change management (which include change release 
in production environment are compliant to the defined procedures 
and segregation of environment  is ensured), program development 
(which include review of data migration activity),  computer operations 
(which includes testing of key controls pertaining to Backup, Batch 
processing  (including  interface  testing),  incident  management  and 
data centre security), System interface controls. This included testing 
that  requests  for  access  to  systems  were  appropriately  logged, 
reviewed  and  authorized.  Also,  entity  level  controls  pertaining  to 
policy and procedure and Business continuity plan assessment due 
impact of COVID-19 was also part of our audit procedure.

In addition to the above, the design and operating effectiveness of 
certain  automated  controls,  that  were  considered  as  key  internal 
system controls over financial reporting were tested. Using various 
techniques  such  as  inquiry,  review  of  documentation  /  record 
/  reports,  observation  and  re-performance.  We  also  tested  few 
controls  using  negative  testing  technique.  We  had  taken  adequate 
samples of instances for our test.  

 Tested compensating controls and performed alternate procedures, 
where  necessary.  In  addition,  understood  where  relevant,  changes 
made to the IT landscape during the audit period.  

Information Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information in the Basel 
III - Pillar 3 disclosures and graphical representation of financial highlights (but does not include the financial statements and our 
auditor’s reports thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this Auditor’s Report, and Annual Report, which is expected to 
be made available to us after that date. 

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those Charged with Governance.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in term 

of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance 

and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the 

Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and circulars, guidelines and 

directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time (the “RBI Guidelines”) as applicable to the Bank. The respective 

Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in 

accordance with the provisions of the Act and the RBI Guidelines for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and 

detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and 

estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 

that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation 

and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 

whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by 

the Directors of the Bank, as aforesaid. 

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are 

responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 

concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to 

cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial 

reporting process. 

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from 

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 

assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing 

(“SAs”) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 

material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 

on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. 

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout 

the audit. We also: 

control.

design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 

to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 

resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal

evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 

ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 

attention in our Auditor’s Report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are 

inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our Auditor’s 

Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we 
are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited 
by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried 
out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with Those Charged with Governance of the Bank and such other entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 

We also provide Those Charged with Governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 

From the matters communicated with Those Charged with Governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2021 and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our Auditor’s Report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Other Matter

as at March 31, 2021, total revenues of ` 1,208,782 Lacs and net cash flows amounting to ` 333 Lacs for the year ended on that 
date, as considered in the consolidated financial statements. These financial statements have been audited by other auditors whose 
reports have been furnished to us by the Management and our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates 
to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries, and our report in terms of sub-section (3) of Section 143 
of the Act, in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, and our report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements below, is not 
modified in respect of the above matters with respect to our reliance on the work done and the reports of the other auditors.

Our 

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the 

possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 

be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to 

future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements may become 

inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Bank, its subsidiary companies, 

which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to 

consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were 

operating effectively as at March 31, 2021, based on the internal control with reference to consolidated financial statements criteria 

established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 

Opinion

issued by the ICAI.

Other Matters

Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial 

controls with reference to consolidated financial statements insofar as it relates to two subsidiary companies, which are companies 

incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India.

Annexure A to the Independent Auditors’ Report of even date on the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of HDFC Bank Limited 
Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent Auditor’s Report of 
even date to the Members of HDFC Bank Limited on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2021 

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Bank as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021, we 
have audited the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of HDFC Bank Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as “the Bank”) and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Bank, its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible 
for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control with reference to consolidated financial 
statements criteria established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (“the ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective Bank’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of 
the Bank, its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued 
by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports 
referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Bank, its subsidiary companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A Bank’s internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  for  external 
purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  Bank’s  internal  financial  control  with  reference  to 
consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being made only in accordance 
with authorizations of management and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated 
financial statements.

amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  (including  contingent 
liabilities) as of the date of the financial statements and the 
reported income and expenses for the reporting period.

the guidelines and at levels stipulated by RBI from time to 
time. In the case of overseas branches, general provision 
on standard advances is maintained at the higher of the 
levels  stipulated  by  the  respective  overseas  regulator  or 
RBI. Provision for standard assets is included under other 
liabilities.

Provisions  made  in  addition  to  the  Bank’s  policy  for 
specific loan loss provisions for non-performing assets and 
regulatory general provisions are categorised as floating 
provisions. Creation of floating provisions is considered by 
the Bank up to a level approved by the Board of Directors. 
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, floating provisions 
are  used  up  to  a  level  approved  by  the  Board  only  for 
contingencies under extraordinary circumstances and for 
making specific provisions for impaired accounts as per 
these guidelines or any regulatory guidance / instructions. 
Floating provisions are included under other liabilities.

Further  to  the  provisions  required  to  be  held  according 
to the asset classification status, provisions are  held for 
individual country exposures (other than for home country 
exposure). Countries are categorised into risk categories 
as per Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. 
(‘ECGC’) guidelines and provisioning is done in respect of 
that country where the net funded exposure is one percent 
or more of the Bank’s total assets. Provision for country risk 
is included under other liabilities.

In  addition  to  the  above,  the  Bank  on  a  prudent  basis 
makes provisions on advances or exposures which are not 
NPAs, but has reasons to believe on the basis of the extant 
environment  or  specific  information  or  basis  regulatory 
guidance / instructions, of a possible slippage of a specific 
advance or a group of advances or exposures or potential 
exposures. These are classified as contingent provisions 
and included under other liabilities. 

The Bank considers a restructured account as one where 
the  Bank,  for  economic  or  legal  reasons  relating  to  the 
borrower’s  financial  difficulty,  grants  to  the  borrower 
concessions that the Bank would not otherwise consider. 
Restructuring would normally involve modification of terms 
of the advance / securities, which would generally include, 
among others, alteration of repayment period / repayable 
amount / the amount of instalments / rate of interest (due 
to reasons other than competitive reasons). Restructured 
accounts  are  classified  as  such  by  the  Bank  only  upon 
approval and implementation of the restructuring package. 
Restructuring of an account is done at a borrower level. 

In accordance with the RBI guidelines on the prudential 
framework  for  resolution  of  stressed  assets  and  the 
resolution framework for COVID-19 related stress, the Bank 
in accordance with its Board approved policy, carried out 
one-time  restructuring  of  eligible  borrowers.  The  asset 
classification and necessary provisions thereon are done 
in accordance with the said RBI guidelines.

HDB Financial Services Limited
Classification:
Receivables  under  financing  activity  are  classified  as 
standard,  sub-standard  and  doubtful  assets  as  per  the 
Company policy approved by the Board and as per RBI 
guidelines. The rates applied for making provisions on non-
performing  assets  (NPA)  are  higher  than  those  required 
by the relevant RBI guidelines. Interest on non-performing 
assets is transferred to an interest suspense account and 
not recognised in the Profit and Loss Account until received. 
Receivables  under  financing  activity  are  recognised  on 
disbursement of loan and in case of new asset financing 
on the transfer of ownership.

Provisioning:
The Company assesses all receivables for their recoverability 
and accordingly recognises provision for non-performing 
and doubtful assets as per approved Company policies and 
guidelines. The Company ensures provisions made are not 
lower than as stipulated by RBI guidelines.

The  Company  provides  0.40%  on  standard  assets  as 
stipulated by RBI guidelines.

Loan origination costs:
Brokerage, commission, incentive to employee etc. paid at 
the time of acquisition of loans are charged to expenses.

3  Securitisation and transfer of assets

HDFC Bank Limited
Assets  transferred  through  securitisation  and  direct 
assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the Balance 
Sheet when they are sold (true sale criteria being fully met 
with) and consideration is received by the Bank. Sales / 
transfers that do not meet these criteria for surrender of 
control are accounted for as borrowings. In accordance 
with RBI guidelines, the Bank amortises any profit received 
for a securitisation or direct assignment transaction based 
on the method prescribed and any loss arising therefrom 
is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account at the time of 
sale.

The  Bank  transfers  advances  through  inter-bank 
participation  with  and  without  risk.  In  accordance  with 
the RBI guidelines, in the case of participation with risk, 
the aggregate amount of the participation issued by the 
Bank  is  reduced  from  advances  and  where  the  Bank  is 
participating,  the  aggregate  amount  of  the  participation 
is classified under advances. In the case of participation 
without risk, the aggregate amount of participation issued 
by the Bank is classified under borrowings and where the 
Bank is participating, the aggregate amount of participation 
is shown as due from banks under advances.

In  accordance  with  RBI  guidelines  on  sale  of  non-
performing  advances,  if  the  sale  is  at  a  price  below  the 
net book value (i.e., book value less provisions held), the 
shortfall is charged to the Profit and Loss Account and if 
the sale is for a value higher than the net book value, the 
excess provision is credited to the Profit and Loss Account 
in the year the amounts are received.

In respect of stressed assets sold by the Bank under an 
asset securitisation, where the investment by the bank in 
security receipts (SRs) backed by the assets sold by it is 
more  than  10  percent  of  such  SRs,  in  accordance  with 
RBI guidelines, provisions held are higher of the provisions 
required  in  terms  of  net  asset  value  declared  by  the 
Securitisation Company (‘SC’) / Reconstruction Company 
(‘RC’) and provisions as per the extant norms applicable to 
the underlying loans, notionally treating the book value of 
these SRs as the corresponding stressed loans assuming 
the loans remained in the books of the Bank. 

The  Bank  invests  in  Pass  Through  Certificates  (PTCs) 
issued by other Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). These 
are accounted for at the deal value and are classified as 
investments. The Bank also buys loans through the direct 
assignment route which are classified as advances. These 
are carried at acquisition cost unless it is more than the 
face value, in which case the premium is amortised over 
the tenor of the loans.

a)  On receivables being assigned / securtised, the 
assets are de-recognised as all the rights, title, 
future receivables & interest thereof are assigned 
to the purchaser.

4.  Priority  Sector 

Lending  Certificates  

(PSLCs)
The Bank enters into transactions for the sale or purchase 
of Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLCs). In the case 
of a sale transaction, the Bank sells the fulfilment of priority 
sector obligation and in the case of a purchase transaction 
the  Bank  buys  the  fulfilment  of  priority  sector  obligation 
through RBI trading platform. There is no transfer of risks 
or loan assets. The fee received for the sale of PSLCs is 
recorded  as  miscellaneous  income  and  the  fee  paid  for 
purchase of the PSLCs is recorded as other expenditure 
in Profit and Loss Account. These are amortised over the 
period of the Certificate.

5  Fixed assets and depreciation

HDFC Bank Limited
Fixed  assets  are  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated 
depreciation  as  adjusted  for  impairment,  if  any.  Cost 
includes  cost  of  purchase  and  all  expenditure  like  site 
preparation,  installation  costs  and  professional  fees 
incurred on the asset before it is ready to use. Subsequent 
expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised only 
when it increases the future benefit / functioning capability 
from / of such assets. 

Depreciation is charged over the estimated useful life of 
the fixed asset on a straight-line basis. The management 
believes that the useful life of assets assessed by the Bank, 
pursuant to Part C of Schedule II to the Companies Act, 
2013, taking into account changes in environment, changes 
in technology, the utility and efficacy of the asset in use, 
fairly reflects its estimate of useful lives of the fixed assets. 
The  estimated  useful  lives  of  key  fixed  assets  are  given 
below: 

b)  Gains arising on assignment of receivables will be 
recognised at the end of the tenure of assignment

6  Translation of foreign currency items

HDFC Bank Limited

Foreign currency income and expenditure items of domestic 

operations are translated at the exchange rates prevailing on 

the date of the transaction. Income and expenditure items

Fixed  assets  are  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated 

depreciation  and  impairment,  if  any.  The  cost  of  fixed 

assets comprise purchase price and any attributable cost 

of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended 

use.  Subsequent  expenditure  incurred  on  assets  put  to 

use is capitalised only when it increases the future benefit 

/ functioning capability from / of such assets.

Depreciation is charged over the estimated useful life of the 

fixed assets on a straight line basis in the manner prescribed 

in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. The estimated

Profit and Loss Account.

HDFC Securities Limited
Tangible fixed assets are stated at acquisition cost, net of 
accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment 
losses, if any. Cost comprises purchase price and expenses 
directly  attributable  to  bringing  the  asset  to  its  working 
condition for the intended use. Subsequent expenditure 
related to an item of fixed asset are added to its book value 
only if it increases the future benefits from the existing asset 
beyond its previously assessed standard of performance.

Items  of  fixed  assets  that  have  been  retired  from  active 
use  and  are  held  for  disposal  are  stated  at  the  lower  of 
their net book value and net realisable value and are shown 
separately in the financial statements.

Gains or losses arising from disposal or retirement of tangible 
fixed assets are measured as the difference between the 
net  disposal  proceeds  and  the  carrying  amount  of  the 
asset  and  are  recognised  net,  within  “Other  Income”  or 
“Other Expenses”, as the case maybe, in the Profit and Loss 
Account in the year of disposal or retirement.

Capital work-in-progress are fixed assets which are not yet 
ready for their intended use. Such assets are carried at cost 
comprising direct cost and related incidental expenses.

Depreciation  is  provided  on  a  pro-rata  basis  to  fully 
depreciate the assets using the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of the assets.

(cid:1)(cid:116)(cid:1)

All  tangible  and  intangible  assets  costing  less  than 
` 5,000 individually are fully depreciated in the year of 
purchase.

Schedules to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended March 31, 2021 

Foreign  currency  denominated  contingent  liabilities  on 
account  of  foreign  exchange  and  derivative  contracts, 
guarantees,  letters  of  credit,  acceptances  and 
endorsements are reported at closing rates of exchange 
notified by FEDAI as at the Balance Sheet date.

HDFC Securities Limited
Foreign  currency  transactions  are  recorded  at  the  rates 
of  exchange  prevailing  on  the  date  of  the  transaction. 
Exchange  differences,  if  any  arising  out  of  transactions 
settled  during  the  year  are  recognized  in  the  Profit  and 
Loss Account. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in  foreign  currencies  as  at  the  Balance  Sheet  date  are 
translated at the closing exchange rate on that date. The 
exchange differences, if any, are recognised in the Profit 
and  Loss  Account  and  related  assets  and  liabilities  are 
accordingly restated in the Balance Sheet.

7  Foreign exchange and derivative contracts

HDFC Bank Limited
Foreign exchange spot and forward contracts outstanding 
as  at  the  Balance  Sheet  date  and  held  for  trading,  are 
revalued at the closing spot and forward rates respectively 
as notified by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts 
of interim maturities. 

The USD-INR rate for valuation of contracts having longer 
maturities i.e. greater than one year, is derived using the 
MIFOR and LIBOR curves. For other currency pairs, the 
forward points (for rates / tenors not published by FEDAI) 
are obtained from Refinitiv or Bloomberg for valuation of 
the forex deals. Valuation is considered on present value 
basis, as directed by FEDAI. For this purpose the forward 
profit or loss on the deals are discounted till the valuation 
date using the discounting yields. The resulting profit or loss 
on valuation is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. 
Foreign exchange contracts are classified as assets when 
the fair value is positive (positive marked to market value) or 
as liabilities when the fair value is negative (negative marked 
to market value).

Foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  not  intended  for 
trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of 
reporting currency required or available at the settlement 
date of a transaction and are outstanding at the Balance 
Sheet date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate. 
The premium or discount arising at the inception of such 
forward  exchange  contract  is  amortised  as  expense  or 
income over the life of the contract.

The Bank recognises all derivative contracts (other than 
those designated as hedges) at fair value, on the date on 
which the derivative contracts are entered into and are re-
measured at fair value as at the Balance Sheet or reporting 
dates.  Derivatives  are  classified  as  assets  when  the  fair 
value  is  positive  (positive  marked  to  market  value)  or  as 

294

liabilities when the fair value is negative (negative marked 
to market value). Changes in the fair value of derivatives 
other than those designated as hedges are recognised in 
the Profit and Loss Account.

Derivative contracts designated as hedges are not marked 
to market unless their underlying transaction is marked to 
market. In respect of derivative contracts that are marked 
to market, changes in the market value are recognised in 
the  Profit  and  Loss  Account  in  the  relevant  period.  The 
Bank identifies  the hedged item (asset or  liability) at the 
inception of the transaction itself. Hedge effectiveness is 
ascertained at the time of the inception of the hedge and 
periodically thereafter. Gains or losses arising from hedge 
ineffectiveness, if any, are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account.

HDB Financial Services Limited
Derivative contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, 
the  hedging  instrument  is  measured  at  fair  value  and 
any  gain  or  loss  that  is  determined  to  be  an  effective 
hedge is recognised within equity i.e., Cash flow Hedge 
Reserve. Amounts recognised in equity are transferred to 
the  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  in  the  same  period  as 
the  cash  flows  of  hedged  items  affect  the  Statement  of 
Profit and Loss. When a derivative contract expires or is 
sold or if a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, any cumulative profit or loss in the Cash Flow 
Hedge Reserve is retained in equity until the hedged cash 
flow  is  recognised  in  the  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss. 
However, if hedged cash flows are no longer expected to 
occur, the profit or loss against the corresponding derivative 
contract, accumulated in the Cash Flow Hedge Reserve, is 
immediately released through the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised 
immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

9  Employee benefits
HDFC Bank Limited
Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOS):
The  Employee  Stock  Option  Scheme  (‘the  Scheme’) 
provides for the grant of options to acquire equity shares 
of the Bank to its employees and whole time directors. The 
options granted to employees vest in a graded manner and 
these may be exercised by the employees within a specified 
period. 

The  Bank  follows  the  intrinsic  value  method  to  account 
for  its  stock-based  employee  compensation  plans. 
Compensation cost is measured by the excess, if any, of the 
market price of the underlying stock over the exercise price 
as determined under the option plan. The market price is 
the  closing  price  on  the  stock  exchange  where  there  is 
highest  trading  volume  on  the  working  day  immediately 
preceding the date of grant. Compensation cost, if any is 
amortised over the vesting period.

Gratuity:
The  Bank  has  an  obligation  towards  gratuity,  a  defined 
benefit  retirement  plan  covering  all  eligible  employees. 
The  plan  benefit  vests  upon  completion  of  five  years  of 
service and is in the form of lump sum amount, without an 
upper limit, equivalent to 15 days’ basic salary payable for 
each completed year of service to all eligible employees on 
resignation, retirement, death while in employment or on 
termination of employment. The Bank makes contributions 
to a recognized Gratuity Trust administered by trustees and 
whose  funds  are  managed  by  insurance  companies.  In 
respect of erstwhile Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) employees, 
the Bank makes contribution to a fund set up by eLKB and 
administered by the Board of Trustees. 

The  defined  gratuity  benefit  plans  are  valued  by  an 
independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet date using 
the projected unit credit method as per the requirement of 
AS-15, Employee Benefits, to determine the present value 
of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  and  the  related  service 
costs. The actuarial calculations entails assumptions about 
demographics,  early  retirement,  salary  increases  and 
interest rates. Actuarial gain or loss is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account.

Introduction to 

Our 

Superannuation:
The  Bank  has  a  Superannuation  Plan  under  which 
employees  of  the  Bank,  above  a  prescribed  grade,  are 
entitled to receive retirement benefits either through salary 
or under a defined contribution plan. For those opting for 
a defined contribution plan, the Bank contributes a sum 
equivalent to 13% of the employee’s eligible annual basic 
salary  (15%  for  the  whole  time  directors  and  for  certain 
eligible  employees  of  the  erstwhile  Centurion  Bank  of 
Punjab (eCBoP) staff) to a Trust administered by trustees 
and whose funds are managed by insurance companies. 
The Bank has no liability towards future superannuation 
fund benefits other than its contribution, and recognises 
such contribution as an expense in the year incurred.

Provident fund:
The Bank is covered under the Employees Provident Fund 
and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and accordingly 
all employees of the Bank are entitled to receive benefits 
under the provident fund. The Bank contributes an amount, 
on a monthly basis, at a determined rate (currently 12% of 
employee’s basic salary). Of this, the Bank contributes an 
amount equal to 8.33% of employee’s basic salary up to a 
maximum salary level of ` 15,000/- per month, to the Pension 
Scheme  administered  by  the  Regional  Provident  Fund 
Office. The balance amount of the 12% employer’s share is 
contributed to an exempted Trust set up by the Bank and 
administered by a Board of Trustees. The Bank recognises 
such contributions as an expense in the year in which it is 
incurred. Interest payable to the members of the exempted 
trust shall not be lower than the statutory rate of interest 
declared by the Central Government under the Employees 
Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and 
shortfall, if any, shall be made good by the Bank.

The  guidance  note  on  implementing  AS-15,  Employee 
Benefits, states that benefits involving employer established 
provident  funds,  which  require  interest  shortfalls  to  be 
provided, are to be considered as defined benefit plans. 
Actuarial valuation of this Provident Fund interest shortfall 
is done as per the guidance note issued in this respect by 
The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) and provision towards 
this liability is made.

The overseas branches of the Bank make contribution to the 
respective applicable government social security scheme 
calculated  as  a  percentage  of  the  employees’  salaries. 
The Bank’s obligations are limited to these contributions, 
which are expensed when due, as such contribution is in 
the nature of defined contribution.

Leave encashment:
The  Bank  has  a  policy  of  encashing  unavailed  leave  for 
eLKB  employees  under  Indian  Banks’  Association  (IBA) 
structure. The Bank provides for leave encashment based 
on an independent actuarial valuation at the Balance Sheet 

date, which includes assumptions about demographics, 
early retirement, salary increases, interest rates and leave 
utilisation.

Pension:
In respect of pension payable to certain eLKB employees 
under IBA structure, which is a defined benefit scheme, 
the  Bank  contributes  10%  of  basic  salary  to  a  pension 
trust set up by the Bank and administered by the Board 
of Trustees and an additional amount towards the liability 
shortfall based on an independent actuarial valuation as 
at  the  Balance Sheet  date, which includes assumptions 
about demographics, early retirement, salary increases and 
interest rates.

In respect of certain eLKB employees who had moved to 
a Cost to Company (CTC) based compensation structure 
and  had  completed  less  than  15  years  of  service,  the 
contribution which was made until then, is maintained as a 
fund and will be converted into annuity on separation after a 
lock-in-period of two years. For this category of employees, 
liability stands frozen and no additional provision is required 
except for interest as applicable to Provident Fund, which 
is provided for.

In respect of certain eLKB employees who moved to a CTC 
structure and had completed service of more than 15 years, 
pension  would  be  paid  on  separation  based  on  salary 
applicable as on the date of movement to CTC structure. 
Provision  thereto  is  made  based  on  an  independent 
actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet date.

New Pension Scheme (NPS):
In respect of  employees  who opt for contribution to the 
NPS, the Bank contributes certain percentage of the basic 
salary of employees  to  the aforesaid scheme, a defined 
contribution plan, which is managed and administered by 
pension fund management companies. The Bank has no 
liability  other  than  its  contribution,  and  recognises  such 
contributions as an expense in the year incurred.

HDFC Securities Limited

Short term
Short  term  employee  benefits  include  salaries  and 
performance  incentives.  A  liability  is  recognised  for  the 
amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus 
or target based incentives if the Company has a present 
legal or informal obligation to pay this amount as a result of 
past service provided by the employee, and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably. These costs are recognised as an 
expense in the Profit and Loss Account at the undiscounted 
amount expected to be paid over the period of services 
rendered by the employees to the Company.

10  Debit and credit cards reward points

HDFC Bank Limited
The  Bank  estimates  the  probable  redemption  of  debit 
and credit card reward points and cost per point using an 
actuarial method by employing an independent actuary, 
which includes assumptions such as mortality, redemption 
and  spends.  Provisions  for  liabilities  on  the  outstanding 
reward points are made based on an independent actuarial 
valuation as at the Balance Sheet date and included in other 
liabilities and provisions.

11   Bullion

HDFC Bank Limited
The Bank imports bullion including precious metal bars on 
a consignment basis. The imports are typically on a back-
to-back basis and are priced to the customer based on 
the price quoted by the supplier. The difference between 
the price recovered from customers and cost of bullion is 
accounted at the time of sale to the customers and reported 
as “Other Income’’.

 The Bank also deals in bullion on a borrowing and lending 
basis  and  the  interest  thereon  is  accounted  as  interest 
expense / income respectively.

12  Lease accounting

Lease payments including cost escalation for assets taken 
on operating lease are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account  over  the  lease  term  on  a  straight-line  basis  in 
accordance with the AS-19, Leases.

13  Income tax

Income tax expense comprises current tax provision (i.e. 
the amount of tax for the period determined in accordance 
with the Income Tax Act, 1961, the rules framed thereunder 
and considering the material principles set out in Income 
Computation and Disclosure Standards) and the net change 
in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax 
consequences of timing differences between the carrying 
values  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  respective  tax 
bases, and operating loss carried forward, if any. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted 
or substantively enacted tax rates as at the Balance Sheet 
date. 

Current tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are off-set when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority, when the entity has 
a legal right to off-set and when the entity intends to settle 
on a net basis.

A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is:

not recognised as it is not probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation or a 
reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot 
be made.

When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is 
remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Onerous contracts
Provisions  for  onerous  contracts  are  recognised  when 
the expected benefits to be derived by the Bank from a 
contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting 
the future obligations under the contract. The provision is 
measured at the present value of the lower of the expected 
cost  of  terminating  the  contract  and  the  expected  net 
cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is 
established, the Bank recognises any impairment loss on 
the assets associated with that contract.

18  Cash and cash equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and gold in hand, 
balances with RBI, balances with other banks and money 
at call and short notice.

19  Corporate social responsibility 

Contingent assets, if any, are not recognised in the financial 
statements since this may result in the recognition of income 
that may never be realised.

Expenditure  towards  corporate  social  responsibility,  in 
accordance with Companies Act, 2013, is recognised in 
the Profit and Loss Account.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there 
is  reasonable  certainty  that  the  assets  can  be  realised 
in future. In case  of unabsorbed depreciation  or  carried 
forward loss under taxation laws, deferred tax assets are 
recognised  only  if  there  is  virtual  certainty  of  realisation 
of such assets. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date and appropriately adjusted to reflect the 
amount that is reasonably / virtually certain to be realised.

14  Earnings per share

The Group reports basic and diluted earnings per equity 
share in accordance with AS-20, Earnings per Share. Basic 
earnings per equity share has been computed by dividing 
net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential 
dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to 
issue equity shares were exercised or converted to equity 
during  the  year.  Diluted  earnings  per  equity  share  are 
computed using the weighted average number of equity 
shares and the dilutive potential equity shares outstanding 
during the period except where the results are anti-dilutive.

15  Share issue expenses
HDFC Bank Limited
Share issue expenses are adjusted from Share Premium 
Account in terms of Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013.

16  Segment information 

The  disclosure  relating  to  segment  information  is  in 
accordance  with  AS-17,  Segment  Reporting  and  as  per 
guidelines issued by RBI.

17  Accounting 

for  provisions,  contingent  

liabilities and contingent assets
In accordance with AS-29, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities 
and Contingent Assets, the Group recognises provisions 
when it has a present obligation as a result of a past event, 
it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and when a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
can be made. 

Provisions are determined based on management estimate 
required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date, 
supplemented by experience of similar transactions. These 
are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to 
reflect the current management estimates.

equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding during the year, except where the results are anti-dilutive. The 

dilutive impact is on account of stock options granted to employees by the Bank. There is no impact of dilution on the profits 

in the current year and previous year.

1  Proposed dividend

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), vide notification dated December 04, 2020, stated that in view of the ongoing stress and 
heightened uncertainty on account of COVID-19, banks should continue to conserve capital to support the economy and 
absorb losses. The notification also stated that in order to further strengthen the banks’ balance sheets, while at the same time 
support lending to the real economy, banks shall not make any dividend payment on equity shares from the profits pertaining 
to the financial year ended March 31, 2020. The Bank did not declare final dividend for the financial year ended March 31, 
2020.

Given that the current “second wave” has significantly increased the number of COVID-19 cases in India and uncertainty 
remains, the Board of Directors of the Bank, at its meeting held on April 17, 2021, has considered it prudent to currently not 
propose dividend for the financial year ended March 31, 2021. The Board shall reassess the position based on any further 
guidelines from the RBI in this regard.

2  Special dividend

During the previous year ended March 31, 2020, the Bank had paid Special Interim Dividend of ` 5 per equity share of face

3  Sub-division of Equity Shares

During the previous year ended March 31, 2020, the shareholders of the Bank at the 25th Annual General Meeting held on July 
12, 2019 approved sub-division (split) of one equity share of the Bank from face value of ` 2/- each into two equity shares of 
face value of ` 1/- each. All shares and per share information in the financial statements reflect the effect of sub-division (split) 
retrospectively.

aggregating to face value ` 2.95 crore (previous year: ` 3.67 crore) in respect of stock options exercised. Accordingly, the 
share capital increased by ` 2.95 crore (previous year: ` 3.67 crore) and the share premium increased by ` 1,757.15 crore

8  Accounting for employee share based payments
       HDFC Bank Limited

The shareholders of the Bank approved the grant of equity share options under Plan “C” in June 2005, Plan “D” in June 2007, 
Plan “E” in June 2010, Plan “F” in June 2013 and Plan “G” in July 2016. Under the terms of each of these Plans, the Bank 
may issue to its employees and Whole Time Directors, Equity Stock Options (‘ESOPs’) each of which is convertible into one 
equity share. All the plans were framed in accordance with the SEBI (Employee Stock Option Scheme and Employee Stock 
Purchase Scheme) Guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and as applicable at the time of the grant. The accounting 
for the stock options has been in accordance with the SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014 to the extent 
applicable.

Plans C, D, E, F and G provide for the issuance of options at the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee of the Board (‘NRC’) at the closing price on the working day immediately preceding the date when options are 
granted. This closing price is the closing price of the Bank’s equity share on an Indian stock exchange with the highest trading 
volume as of the working day preceding the date of grant. 

The vesting conditions applicable to the options are at the discretion of the NRC. These options are exercisable on vesting, 
for a period as set forth by the NRC at the time of the grant. The period in which the options may be exercised cannot exceed 
five years from date of expiry of vesting period. During the years ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, no modifications 
were made to the terms and conditions of ESOPs.

Fair value methodology
The fair value of options used to compute the proforma net profit and earnings per equity share have been estimated on the 
dates of each grant using the binomial option-pricing model. The Bank estimates the volatility based on the historical prices of 
its equity shares. The Bank granted 5,74,66,600 options during the year ended March 31, 2021 (previous year: 4,77,73,600). 
The various assumptions considered in the pricing model for the ESOPs granted during the year ended March 31, 2021 are:

        Fair value methodology

The fair value of options used to compute proforma net profit and earnings per equity share have been estimated on dates of 
each grant using the Black and Scholes model. The shares of the Company are not listed on any stock exchange. Accordingly, 
the Company has considered the volatility of its stock price as an average of the historical volatility of similar listed enterprises 
for the purpose of calculating the fair value to reduce any company specific variations. The various assumptions considered 
in the pricing model for the stock options granted by the Company.

  Method used for accounting for shared based payment plan

The Company uses the intrinsic value method to account for the compensation cost of stock options to employees of the 
Company.

Liability on account of  forward 
exchange and derivative contracts

Guarantees given on behalf 
of constituents, acceptances, 
endorsements and other obligations

Other items for which the Group is 
contingently liable

The Group is a party to various taxation matters in respect of which appeals 
are pending. The Group expects the outcome of the appeals to be favorable 
based on decisions on similar issues in the previous years by the appellate 
authorities, based on the facts of the case and taxation laws.
The  Group  is  a  party  to  various  legal  proceedings  in  the  normal  course  of 
business.  The  Group  does  not  expect  the  outcome  of  these  proceedings  to 
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial conditions, results of 
operations or cash flows.
The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward 
rate  agreements,  currency  swaps  and  interest  rate  swaps  with  inter-bank 
participants  on  its  own  account  and  for  customers.  Forward  exchange 
contracts  are  commitments  to  buy  or  sell  foreign  currency  at  a  future  date 
at  the  contracted  rate.  Currency  swaps  are  commitments  to  exchange  cash 
flows  by  way  of  interest  /  principal  in  one  currency  against  another,  based 
on  predetermined  rates.  Interest  rate  swaps  are  commitments  to  exchange 
fixed  and  floating  interest  rate  cash  flows.  The  notional  amounts  of  financial 
instruments  such  as  foreign  exchange  contracts  and  derivatives  provide  a 
basis  for  comparison  with  instruments  recognised  on  the  Balance  Sheet  but 
do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the 
current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s 
exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become favorable 
(assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market rates or 
prices relative to their terms.
As  a  part  of  its  commercial  banking  activities,  the  Bank  issues  documentary 
credit and guarantees on behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such 
as  letters  of  credit  enhance  the  credit  standing  of  the  Bank’s  customers. 
Guarantees  generally  represent  irrevocable  assurances  that  the  Bank  will 
make  payments  in  the  event  of  the  customer  failing  to  fulfill  its  financial  or 
performance obligations.
These  include:  a)  Credit  enhancements  in  respect  of  securitised-out  loans; 
b)  Bills  rediscounted  by  the  Bank;  c)  Capital  commitments;  d)  Underwriting 
commitments;  e)  Investment  purchases  pending  settlement;  f)  Amount 
transferred  to  the  RBI  under  the  Depositor  Education  and  Awareness  Fund 
(DEAF).

The guidance note on AS-15, Employee Benefits, states that employer established provident funds, where interest is guaranteed 

are to be considered as defined benefit plans and the liability has to be valued. The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) has issued 

a guidance note on valuation of interest rate guarantees on exempt provident funds. The actuary has accordingly valued the 

same and the Bank held a provision of Nil as at March 31, 2021 (previous year: Nil) towards the present value of the guaranteed 

interest benefit obligation. The actuary has followed the deterministic approach as prescribed by the guidance note.

         The retail banking segment of the Bank serves retail customers through the Bank’s branch network and other channels. 
This segment raises deposits from customers and provides loans and other services to customers with the help of 
specialist product groups. Exposures are classified under retail banking taking into account the status of the borrower 
(orientation criterion), the nature of product, granularity of the exposure and the quantum thereof.

Revenues of the retail banking segment are derived from interest earned on retail loans, interest earned from other 
segments for surplus funds placed with those segments, subvention received from dealers and manufacturers, fees from 
services rendered, foreign exchange earnings on retail products etc. Expenses of this segment primarily comprise interest 
expense on deposits, commission paid to retail assets sales agents, infrastructure and premises expenses for operating 
the branch network and other delivery channels, personnel costs, other direct overheads and allocated expenses of 
specialist product groups, processing units and support groups.

 (c)  Wholesale banking

The wholesale banking segment provides loans, non-fund facilities and transaction services to large corporates, emerging 
corporates, public sector units, government bodies, financial institutions and medium scale enterprises. Revenues of the 
wholesale banking segment consist of interest earned on loans made to customers, interest / fees earned on the cash 
float arising from transaction services, earnings from trade services and other non-fund facilities and also earnings from 
foreign exchange and derivative transactions on behalf of customers. The principal expenses of the segment consist of 
interest expense on funds borrowed from external sources and other internal segments, premises expenses, personnel 
costs, other direct overheads and allocated expenses of delivery channels, specialist product groups, processing units 
and support groups.

distribution, primary dealership business and the associated costs. This segment also includes Bank’s subsidiaries.

(e)  Unallocated

All items which are reckoned at an enterprise level are classified under this segment. This includes capital and reserves, 
debt classified as Tier I or Tier II capital and other unallocable assets and liabilities such as deferred tax, prepaid expenses, 
etc.

Segment revenue includes earnings from external customers plus earnings from funds transferred to other segments. 
Segment result includes revenue less interest expense less operating expense and provisions, if any, for that segment. 
Segment-wise income and expenses include certain allocations. Interest income is charged by a segment that provides 
funding to another segment, based on yields benchmarked to an internally approved yield curve or at a certain agreed 
transfer price rate. Transaction charges are levied by the retail banking segment to the wholesale banking segment for 
the use by its customers of the retail banking segment’s branch network or other delivery channels. Segment capital 
employed represents the net assets in that segment.

24  COVID-19

HDFC Bank Limited
Consequent to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian government announced a lockdown in March 2020. 
Subsequently, the national lockdown was lifted by the government, but regional lockdowns continue to be implemented in 
areas with a significant number of COVID-19 cases. 

The impact of COVID-19, including changes in customer behaviour and pandemic fears, as well as restrictions on business and 
individual activities, has led to significant volatility in global and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease in global and 
local economic activities. The slowdown during the year led to a decrease in loan originations, the sale of third party products, 
the use of credit and debit cards by customers and the efficiency in collection efforts. This may lead to a rise in the number 
of customer defaults and consequently an increase in provisions thereagainst. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including the current “second wave” that has significantly increased the number of cases in India, will continue to impact the 
Bank’s results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, among other 
things, any new information concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and any action to contain its spread or mitigate 
its impact whether government-mandated or elected by us.

In accordance with the COVID-19 Regulatory Packages announced by the RBI on March 27, 2020, April 17, 2020 and May 23, 
2020, the Bank, in accordance with its board approved policy, offered a moratorium on the repayment of all instalments and 
/ or interest, as applicable, due between March 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020 to all eligible borrowers classified as standard, 
even if overdue, as on February 29, 2020. In respect of such accounts that were granted moratorium, the asset classification 
remained standstill during the moratorium period. 

  The disclosures as required by the RBI circular dated April 17, 2020 are given below:

Particulars

Respective amounts in SMA / overdue categories, where the moratorium / deferment was extended, in 
terms of paragraph 2 and 3 of the circular (as of February 29,2020)

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a considerable impact on economic activities across the various parts of the

and circumstances existing as of that date, the Company does not anticipate any material uncertainties which affects its liquidity 
position and also ability to continue as a going concern.

Shareholder Information

A)  DIVIDENDS

Receipt of Dividends through Electronic mode
The  SEBI 
(Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure 
Requirements)  Regulations,  2015  have  directed  that 
listed  companies  shall  mandatorily  make  all  payments 
to investors including dividend to shareholders, by using 
any  RBI  approved  electronic  mode  of  payment  viz., 
Electronic  Clearing  System  (ECS),  LECS  (Local  ECS), 
RECS  (Regional  ECS),  NECS  (National  ECS),  Direct 
Credit, RTGS, NEFT etc. 

In order to receive the dividend without loss of time (as and 
when declared by the Bank), all the eligible shareholders 
holding shares in demat mode are requested to update 
with  their  respective  Depository  Participants,  their 
correct core banking account number, including 9 digit 
MICR Code and 11 digit IFSC Code, E-Mail ID and Mobile 
No(s).  This  will  facilitate  the  remittance  of  the  dividend 
amount as directed by SEBI directly in the Bank Account 
electronically. Updation of E-Mail IDs and Mobile No(s) 
will enable sending communication relating to credit of 
dividend, unencashed dividend etc. 

Shareholders  holding  shares  in  physical  form  may 
communicate  details  relating  to  their  core  banking 
account, viz., core banking account number, including 9 
digit MICR Code and 11 digit IFSC Code, E- Mail ID and 
Mobile No(s) to the Registrar and Share Transfer Agents 
viz.,  Datamatics  Business  Solutions  Limited  (formerly, 
Datamatics Financial Services Limited,) having address 
at Plot No. B 5, Part B Crosslane, MIDC, Marol, Andheri 
(E),  Mumbai-400  093,  by  quoting  the  reference  folio 
number and attaching a photocopy of the Cheque leaf 
of  their  active  core  banking  account  and  also  a  self-
attested copy of their PAN card and a self-attested copy 
of any one of the documents mentioned hereafter: utility 
payment  bills  (not  more  than  three  months  old)  /  bank 
pass  book  /  passport  /  driving  license  to  validate  their 
present address.

Various  modes  for  making  payment  of  dividend  under 
electronic mode: 

In  case,  the  shareholder  has  updated  core  banking 
account details (including 9 digit MICR Code and 11 digit 
IFSC code) for the purpose of payment of dividend (as 
and  when  declared  by  the  Bank),  then  the  Bank  shall 
make  the  payment  of  dividend  to  such  shareholder 
under any one of the following modes: 

1.  National Automated Clearing House (NACH) 

2.  National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) 

3.  Direct credit in case the shareholders have an 
active Bank account with HDFC Bank Limited. 

In case dividend paid by electronic mode is returned or 
rejected by the corresponding bank due to any reason 
then the Bank will issue a dividend warrant and print the 
bank account details available in its records on the said 
dividend warrant to avoid fraudulent encashment of the 
warrants. The dividend warrant will be dispatched by the 
Registrars at the registered address of the shareholder.

Deduction of tax at source on dividend
In terms of the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, (“the Act”), 
dividend paid or distributed by a Company on or after April 1, 
2020 is taxable in the hands of the shareholders. The Company 
shall therefore be required to deduct tax at source at the time 
of payment of dividend.  The deduction of tax at source will be 
based on the category of shareholders and subject to fulfilment 
of conditions as provided herein below:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:39)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:1)(cid:83)(cid:70)(cid:84)(cid:74)(cid:69)(cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:1)(cid:84)(cid:73)(cid:66)(cid:83)(cid:70)(cid:73)(cid:80)(cid:77)(cid:69)(cid:70)(cid:83)(cid:84)
Tax will be deducted at source (“TDS”) under Section 194 
of the Act @ 10% on the amount of dividend payable unless 
exempt under any of the provisions of the Act. However, in 
case of resident shareholders, TDS would not apply if the 
aggregate of total dividend distributed/paid to them by the 
Company during a financial year does not exceed ` 5,000.

Tax  will  not  be  deducted  at  source  in  cases  where  a 
shareholder provides Form 15G (applicable to all assessees 
other than firms and companies) / Form 15H (applicable 
to an individual above the age of 60 years), provided that 
the eligibility conditions are met. Blank Form 15G and 15H 
can be downloaded from the link given at the end of this

Form are mandatory and the Bank may reject the forms 
submitted, if it does not fulfil the requirement of the law.

(“PAN”) will be mandatorily required.  Shareholders who 
are required to link Aadhaar number with PAN as required 
under  section  139AA(2)  read  with  Rule  114AAA,  should 
compulsorily link the same by June 30, 2021. If, as required 
under the law, any PAN is found to have not been linked 
with Aadhaar by June 30, 2021 then such a PAN will be 
inoperative and Tax would be deducted at a higher rate 
under section 206AA of the Act. The Bank reserves its right 
to recover any demand raised subsequently on the Bank 
for not informing the Bank or providing wrong information 
about applicability of Section 206AA in your case.

HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2020 21Statutory Reports and Financial StatementsOverviewIntroduction to HDFC BankOur PerformanceHow We Create ValueOur StrategyResponsible Business In the year of the pandemic, which put to test conventional notions of resilience and relevance, we not only delivered profitable growth, but also expanded our balance sheet without compromising on asset quality.

Our net interest income grew by 15.5% while net profit increased by 18.5%.

Our gross NPAs stood at 1.32% compared with 1.26% a year earlier, while our balance sheet size increased by 14.1%.

This healthy performance in an extremely challenging environment is a reflection of our strong foundation, on which we aspire to build a stronger future.

Despite significant restrictions on mobility and physical proximity, we not only delivered essential’ banking services to our customers, but also grew our advances by 14%.

We also continued to deliver on our sustainable development objectives backed by our employee volunteers and partners.

Dear Mr. Puri, Sometimes words are not enough to express the influence you have had in building HDFC Bank into an industry bellwether in 25 years.

Yet, as you leave behind your indelible imprint on everything we do today, we extend the humble two words of thank you’ to express our gratitude for making us an integral part of a transformative journey.

The roadmap you have given us we will tread on that.

The journey that began during the initial phase of India’s liberalisation now connects the many Bharats that live within.

As we take confident strides into a rapidly changing digital world with a customer first approach, knowledge, simplicity, empathy in our DNA, we remain true to your legacy upholding the highest standards in corporate governance, inspiring actions for meaningful social impact, nurturing talent and continuing to be one of India’s most trusted and valuable brands.

Thank you once again for giving us the confidence that the best of the Bank is yet to come.

Let me start by wishing all of you good health and happiness.

The financial year gone by has taught all of us to value this more than anything else.

Many of you may have lost your near and dear ones.

We in the HDFC Bank family too have lost several colleagues.

We are supporting and will continue to support their families.

The year gone by saw people across the world being largely confined to their homes with several travel restrictions in place.

They faced myriad personal and professional challenges perhaps never before encountered in our lifetime.

This obviously had an effect on the economy with the world officially being plunged into recession.

Governments and Central Banks across the world reacted introducing a range of measures to revive the economy and help people move forward.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Government introduced a slew of measures to revive the economy.

These measures bore fruit with the economy growing by 1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of the year while it had contracted by 24.4 per cent at the end of the first quarter.

In the current financial year India is expected to be one of the fastest growing economies in the world.

The second wave of the pandemic has dented the optimism a bit, but the peak of the pandemic clearly appears to be behind us.

As the vaccine rollout gathers momentum, the economy is expected to be on a much stronger footing especially from the second quarter.

We posted a healthy growth in Net Profit, Net Interest Income and Balance Sheet size without compromising on asset quality.

Net Profit increased by 18.5 per cent to 31,116.5 Crore in FY21 and balance sheet size by 14.1 per cent to 1,746,871 Crore.

Gross NPAs increased to 1.32 per cent in FY21 from 1.26 per cent in the previous year.

Net interest income, an indication of the difference between interest earned and interest paid grew by 15.5 per cent to 64,879.6 Crore.

The details of our performance are elaborated in the report.

I am proud of my colleagues and thank all of them (and their families too) for this performance despite, the difficulties they had to face during the year.

As an organisation we learnt and relearnt on the way, pivoted our way to a Work from Home culture and continued to serve our customers.

I am delighted by the way our colleagues responded to the myriad challenges we all faced.

At this point I would like to elaborate on some of our strengths and also talk about things that we could have done better.

One of our biggest strengths has been the legacy of over a quarter century.

Our iconic ex Managing Director, Mr Aditya Puri created an institution with strong foundation and fundamentals.

It is a huge advantage as well as a privilege to inherit and build upon this.

Thanks to his leadership, we today have a strong balance sheet with among the lowest NPAs in the banking industry and strong capitalisation.

This has helped us to lend even during difficult times, build market leadership and deliver shareholder value without compromising on our commitment to society and the environment.

Quite frankly, it continues to remain both a strength as well as an area for improvement.

In the last couple of years our technological capability has been questioned.

But at the same time, we cannot afford to miss the big picture.

We would not have become a Bank of this scale, size, and grown market share consistently year after year, without having a strong technology backbone.

We are one of the largest transaction processing Banks and have come up with cutting edge customer solutions like 10 second personal loans and digital loan against mutual funds.

Not to forget the rollout of Video KYC during the pandemic which helped people to become a bank customer from the safety of their homes.

Or the DigiDemat and Trading Account which we introduced in partnership with our subsidiary last year.

In the last 28 months, we have, however, been in the spotlight for the wrong reasons when it comes to technology.

The technology problems as well as the compliance issues have led to regulatory actions.

The last technology downtime led to the Reserve Bank of India banning us from issuing new credit cards as well as putting on hold new launches under Digital 2.0 initiative.

Further, the regulator also appointed a third party audit of our IT systems.

This audit is now over and the report has been submitted to the regulator.

As a Bank we are certainly sorry for what has happened.

And have taken this as an opportunity to improve and redouble our efforts to fix this problem for good.

We have now embarked on a scale changing technology adoption and transformation agenda to help drive our ambitious future growth plans.

We are also in the process of accelerating our cloud strategy to be on the cutting edge leveraging best in class cloud service providers.

We have strengthened the Disaster Recovery trials and processes so as to bounce back to serve our customers faster and quicker.

We have to be scanning the horizon for potential security issues and be ever prepared to face them.

But this is always an important area of focus and action plans are underway for further robustness.

While we execute this Technology Transformation agenda, there will sometimes be pain and outages beyond our control.

As mentioned earlier we are putting in place measures that will ensure that downtimes will not be prolonged.

Yes, it will take some time but we will get around this.

And live up to the standards that people have come to expect from us.

There has also been some discussion around the deficiencies in compliance regarding the selling of GPS products.

For many years we had been bundling the financing of GPS systems and cars.

The teams believed this was a routine lending activity.

Also, a particular vendor had entered into an arrangement with us directly.

These products were never sold on a standalone basis but only bundled along with the purchase of cars.

In November 2019, a whistle blower alleged that the vendor was incentivising some of the employees in the auto loan team to bundle these products with our car loans.

We immediately conducted an enquiry and basis the findings have taken necessary actions against the involved employees including termination of their services and also terminated the arrangement with the vendor.

RBI in the meanwhile also issued a show cause notice in connection with the Bank’s arrangement with the vendor.

They contended that such an arrangement was in violation of provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and hence the Bank is liable for penal action.

Subsequently we have been asked to pay a penalty of 10 Crore and have also been instructed to repay the commission that we earned from this process back to customers.

We accept this verdict and will comply with the directives.

These incidents have made us realise that we need to reiterate what culture is.

Business objectives should be driven keeping in mind the three Cs: Culture, Conscience and Customers.

But every individual has to ask himself: Am I doing the right thing for the customer Am I doing the right thing for the organisation Does my conscience permit this As a Bank we have always taken pride in our integrity.

However, the unscrupulous practices of a few people has made all of us resolve for far greater process controls to address this.

At an organisational level there is a greater focus on the role of Credit, Risk, Compliance, Audit and other enabling functions so that our checks and balances get strengthened.

Customers are the reason we exist and our primary goal is to serve and delight them.

We are proud of what we have achieved so far and still understand that we have a long way to go in improving our customer experience as consumer behaviours and expectations are changing every day.

As a Bank, we strongly believe we exist to enable our customers make better money choices, today and tomorrow.

To pursue and realise this belief we are encouraging within the bank the principles of Simplicity, Knowledge and Empathy.

Simplicity to make day to day transactions for our customers intuitive and rewarding, Knowledge to help customers realise their future dreams with the right choice of offerings from us and Empathy in the way we deal with our customers.

We have put in place a systemic way of measuring our Customer Experience in the last year by adopting the Net Promoter System.

We now have the ability to listen to our customers post transactions and journeys and we commit to use this feedback to solve their problems.

We are committed to relook at the consumer journeys and redesign them to delight our customers including making investments in new age omni channel customer experience technology and training our people to enable and empower our front end colleagues to serve our customers better.

Reinforcing the three Cs: Culture, Conscience and Customers across the organisation is a clear focus area for both me and the Bank.

The hallmark of our strategy is that it has the ability to adapt, and evolve without losing the core.

We are building upon our stated strategy of expanding our distribution footprint leveraging the Branch Channel and Virtual Relationship Channel with the addition of Digital Marketing as a key channel.

This will enable us to capture the growth potential in both India and Bharat and different consumer segments like the tech savvy and millennials going forward.

While we continue to focus on the Corporate Cluster and Government Business to increase penetration, we have created a new business segment of Commercial (MSME) and Rural Banking to capture the next wave of growth.

We will continue to strengthen our leadership position in the payments business and retail assets business and have added Wealth Management and Private Banking as a core focus area for us.

All these core business areas would be supported by further strengthening our foundational capability in Technology and Digital domains.

Our subsidiaries help us fulfil consumer needs for holistic financial solutions and we will continue to invest in them.

To realise this strategy we have unveiled Project Future Ready.

As a Bank we have grown for over a quarter of a century due to our ability to execute what we have laid out as per our plans.

Project Future Ready aims to continue the same tradition by calling out clear areas of focus to further add strength to our strategic and execution muscle.

These growth engines would be powered by our robust technology and digital platforms.

These growth engines will account for the bulk of our future investments and can be broadly classified as Business Verticals and Delivery Channels.

As mentioned earlier, while we strengthen our Enterprise Technology Factory to keep our systems always ON’, available and secure, we are creating a new Digital Factory.

The mandate of the new Digital Factory is to foster innovations in the Product and Consumer experience domain through own build collaborate with new age fin tech and big tech companies.

Hollowing the core, moving to the cloud, creation of micro services API based architecture, innovating through partnerships leveraging API interconnectivity all backed by a strong Data AI strategy would form the core of what we intend to pursue going forward.

We are working on many new exciting opportunities to improve our consumer experience and introduce new innovations like Banking on the Edge’, which would be announced in due course of time.

The underlying philosophy is to develop employees with diverse skills, multifunctional exposure with a One Bank collaborative mindset to deliver on Project Future Ready and enable more opportunities for career growth.

I firmly believe Project Future Ready will catalyse, create and capture the next wave of growth.

The year gone by has brought home to all of us how interconnected our destinies are.

Our ESG strategy is based on this interconnectedness, especially in the Environment and Social spheres.

Climate change is possibly the biggest threat to humanity after the pandemic.

Global warming has huge potential to disrupt both lives and livelihood.

Over the years we have been taking small but sure steps to mitigate the impact of global warming.

Recently, we have committed ourselves to becoming carbon neutral by the FY32.

As a part of this initiative, the Bank is looking at reducing its emissions, energy and water consumption.

The Bank will continue to incorporate and scale up the use of renewable energy in its operations.

As a part of the roadmap, we will focus on offering loans for green products like electric vehicles at lower interest rates and incorporate ESG scores while making credit decisions.

The Bank is also working on a framework for issuing green bonds.

All this while we continue to transform lives through our CSR initiatives under Parivartan through which we have already impacted over 8.5 Crore lives.

I would like to end by once again thanking all my colleagues and their families for their tremendous efforts this year in spite of trying circumstances.

Finally, my heartfelt gratitude to our customers who continue to repose their faith in us and keep pushing us to strive for more.

To all of them, I would like to say this: There might have been instances where we may not have kept our timelines in serving you, as we used to, due to the pandemic situation we have found ourselves in.

Our sincere apologies and many thanks for your understanding and consideration.

I want to reiterate that we are committed to delight you with renewed vigour as we move forward.

As we grapple with many pandemic induced uncertainties, it is important to not lose the human touch while dealing with people in our day to day lives.

It is the true wealth that we can bequeath to the world.

While business and professional goals have their place, nothing really comes before human life.

The Bank has maintained its leadership position and delivered consistent growth across a majority of its key financial parameters.

Despite being a pandemic disrupted year, it has held its own with a strong customer base, robust risk management framework and best governance practices.

All of this underlines its commitment to Responsible Business’.

The percentage increase in performance indicators was subdued as compared to a pre COVID 19 year even so, the year on year increase in key metrics shows a healthy and continued growth.

The Bank’s growth metrics like its Balance sheet size which crossed 17 Lakh Crore a 14.1% increase, was driven by similar increase in Advances (14.0%) and Deposits (16.3%).

Our efficiency in managing capital can be seen from a 27.0% increase in our low cost CASA deposits the highest in previous three years.

Our profitability in disruptive times, is an outcome of the operational efficiencies built into our system.

We continue to deliver a double digit growth in earnings, with an increase of 18.5% in net profit, while keeping a check on our operational costs, resulting in a lower cost to income ratio of 36.3%.

The Bank’s business resilience is an important indicator of our credit risk evaluation and management.

Our key strength continues to be maintaining one of the lowest levels of Gross Non Performing Assets (NPAs) in the Banking industry with provision coverage ratio of 69.8%.

Figures for the years prior to FY20 have been adjusted to reflect the effect of split of equity shares from face value of 2 each into two equity shares of face value of 1 each.

Semi urban and rural markets (SURU) have been a core element of our strategy since inception.

With the relative insulation of the rural economy from the pandemic, sectors dependent on the hinterland have performed relatively better.

The trend of rising income levels in these markets continued even while the economy was affected by COVID 19.

Today, we are well positioned to address the growing demand for better quality financial products and solutions.

Another key aspect of our strategy in these markets has been the near trebling of the Business Correspondent network to 15,756 from 5,541 in the previous year.

We have adopted a segment specific approach like funding to agribusiness, MSMEs and dairy farmers.

We are focusing on SURU markets not just to expand our loan book, but also to empower our customers.

One such initiative has been the Kisan Dhan Vikas Kendras.

At these centres, farmers access information on soil health, mandi prices, and various government initiatives and receive expert advice.

During the pandemic period, we have piloted digital outreach programmes.

These services are also available on the Bank’s website in vernacular languages.

The focus on SURU validates our ability to identify opportunities early and address them by providing a wide range of products and solutions that are aligned with the customers’ evolving needs.

Bapupura is a small village located in the Gandhinagar district of Gujarat.

Out of the 2,500 odd people that call this village their home, many depend on dairy farming for their livelihood.

India is the largest producer of milk in the world, yet, our farmers lack access to markets, finance and much needed know how to improve yields in the face of climate change.

HDFC Bank, has installed Milk To Money terminals in Bapupura, to help create a viable support ecosystem for small and marginal dairy farmers, automating the entire process of payments.

The Milk To Money terminals act as multifunctional terminals that provide a transparent mechanism for the farmer to be paid exactly as per quality of milk delivered, thus eliminating any errors or discrepancies.

The farmer accounts are electronically credited and they can withdraw the money from cash dispensers immediately, if needed.

One is promoting financial literacy and inclusion in deeper geographies where India resides.

The other is promoting digital transactions for financial services in rural India.

The project benefits the entire community in the locality irrespective of their demographic profile.

This initiative has helped the farmers inculcate the saving habit and ultimately helped enhance their status.

The process of analysing our resilience to physical and transition risk of climate change has been initiated in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

We also continue our endeavour to acquire granular data and test tools for climate risk assessment and conducting scenario analysis.

At present, we view the climate change impact on our cost of debt to be relatively less significant.

We will continue to monitor and review such impacts.

We have delivered consistent performance, even under stressful economic situations, with an aim to create enhanced long term value for our stakeholders.

This is accomplished through discreet strategies and effective capital utilisation.

We have a multi layered risk management process to identify, assess, monitor and manage risks through the effective use of processes, information and technology.

As part of our overall risk management framework, we have a Board approved Stress Testing Policy Framework which forms an integral part of our ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process).

We have also set targets to reduce our GHG emissions.

Further, in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change, we are in the process of committing to science based emissions targets.

Financial inclusion is crucial for India’s sustained economic growth.

As the nation’s largest private bank, we are cognisant of our responsibility to brining the under banked population of the country to the economic mainstream.

This in turn provides an opportunity to reach out to a wider customer base.

We recognise the inherent social and environmental climate change risks in our loan portfolio.

Through Parivartan, we have identified the most disadvantaged sections of the society around our area of operation and work towards empowering them.

These efforts are governed by the Board level CSR ESG Committee.

The Committee monitors the progress of the initiatives on a periodic basis.

We have also aligned our activities with Government missions and initiatives.

Over a quarter of a century, we have built a formidable banking franchise by spotting opportunities early and then capitalising on them in relevant markets and through the right channels.

Steered by a new leadership, we recently launched Project Future Ready to catalyse, create and capture the next wave of growth.

Broadly classified under Business Verticals, Delivery Channels and Technology Digital, these engines will be driven by a workforce with diverse skills, and multifunctional exposure with a One Bank collaborative mindset.

This will be backed by our traditional strengths in Internal Audit, Underwriting, Risk Management and Governance.

Further, we have already outlined our technology transformation agenda to synergise and integrate our technology digital functions and will invest aggressively to both Run and Build the Bank of the future.

As a Bank, we assess disruptions and real time challenges for insights to adapt our strategies and focus areas.

We continue to keep our stakeholders at the centre of our strategy with ESG as an overarching principle.

Our strategic priorities as envisaged in the previous years has held us in good stead through the pandemic.

However, this was a year of improvising, finding solutions and being pragmatic, in an unpredictable domestic and global environment.

To improve focus on what the Bank perceives as growth engines, we have fine tuned our strategic priorities by making them more granular.

Our strategy can be visualised as ten pillars supported by certain enablers.

These are foundational to the Bank and hence critical for achieving our strategic goals.

Focus on customer service is key to the HDFC Banking experience along with the wide range of products and customer centric initiatives.

Enhance our compliance culture and exhibit highest standards in way we go about doing our business.

Our risk management and compliance framework is embedded in the systems and processes across operations and functions and complemented by a risk conscious culture led by the Board.

The Bank encourages organisational culture of mentorship, transparency, communication, empowerment and supporting.

Our nurture and care’ attitude towards our people is fundamental to the Bank’s twin strategic objectives of leadership and development.

Our branches represent the Bank to its customers, the society and other stakeholders and own retail and business customer relationships.

Retail branch banking is the key driver for retail deposits franchise, retail trade and forex business, unsecured and secured asset business and third party distribution business.

At the same time it’s also a congregation place for its sales force to get together, brainstorm and formulate its one bank approach for Go to market’.

Our strategy is to re imagine this channel by bringing more science to the art of relationship management.

The primary objective of this strategy is to acquire new customers, gather a larger share of the wallet of existing customers and deliver a best in class experience, thus building customer loyalty.

The Bank intends to transform its branches into phygital’ financial marketplaces through catchment scoping and mining with institutionalised consistency and customer need centric conversations enabled through artificial intelligence led predictive analytics.

Retail Branch Banking has evolved in a significant manner over a period of time and while the transformation journey continues, the ethos remains the same Focus on customer’.

It also, inter alia, entails the ability to map and source the right set of customers using a differentiated go to market approach.

Omnichannel Experience All of the Bank’s products available at every customer touch point encapsulates the tenet of Need Based Selling’.

Using cutting edge AI, conversations with the customer are more meaningful.

In this endeavour, key strategies include process simplification and digitisation thus reimagining the journeys and making them simple and user friendly.

Also, enable self service wherever possible so that there is complete empowerment of customers in completing paperless journeys on their own.

Net Promoter Score as a metric of measuring customer satisfaction and loyalty has been introduced to build a Customer First’ culture.

Empowering teams to digitally access interactive learning interventions that equip them to build customer delight.

The Bank believed early that traditional relationship management is making way for technology and virtual engagement with customers.

HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2020 21Statutory Reports and Financial StatementsOverviewIntroduction to HDFC BankOur PerformanceHow We Create ValueOur StrategyResponsible Business Strategy in Action in its virtual relationship management channel to further advance its customer engagement and enhance its service experience.

In the last year, digital or contactless banking has become more of a necessity than a service enhancement.

As digital literacy and exposure increases exponentially, VRM is gaining acceptance through wider engagement, deeper relationships and a complete suite of products to offer.

A banking experience with digital ease and personalised conversations is the core of our VRM strategy.

The Virtual Relationship Management practice is an integrated customer centric approach covering three pillars.

Virtual Care a) Seamless 24 7 access to customers with global service standards b) Automated Interactive Voice Response solution in 12 languages with over 20 services.

The model is built on a foundation of Customer Obsession to Nurture, Care and Collaborate.

The Virtual Relationship Managers offer world class service interaction with an analytics led need based product distribution approach aimed to make us the Primary banker of choice to the customer.

The Virtual Relationship Managers serves the customer lifecycle under five pillars a) Save b) Invest c) Borrow d) Transact e) Engage.

This cohesive strategy allows to deepen the relationship and proactively offer the right product program to the customers.

The Bank is making significant investments in technology upgradation of the customer facing solutions around Interactive Voice Response Systems, Data Management and digital engagement platforms like Video KYC to offer world class virtual engagement framework for its customers.

The last few years have been a renaissance of sorts in the Rural Ecosystem with the advent, adaptability and usage of technology in the hinterlands.

There has been a steady rise in mobile penetration in the Rural areas and the access of data has opened up the world of aspiration building, increasing demand and thereafter fulfilment.

With more than half of our banking outlets and a third of our workforce (including Agri SLI and RIG) in this market, we are well poised to excavate and maximise this opportunity by creating phygital processes for business and market share increment as well our Bank’s penetration.

Our Bank’s tie up with CSC a special purpose vehicle (SPV) set up by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) to offer Citizen Facilitation Services digitally has been a catalyst in increasing the distribution footprint in the semi urban and rural geography without incurring cost on setting up a brick mortar model.

Till date we have on boarded more than 1 Lakh VLE’s as Business Facilitators and Business Correspondents to help source business for us.

With the help of the VLEs, we intend to create a large distribution network to capture the opportunities in the semi urban and rural areas as well as geographically increase our reach in deep geographies.

The lifting of the embargo on Government business for private sector banks, the Digital India Mission, and the recent circular on the Single Nodal Agency account by Government of India are strong tailwinds for this business.

The growing emphasis at each level of Government to use technology to bring in transparency and efficiency offers significant promise.

Given our large distribution network including in rural areas, technological prowess, partnerships with key digital platform and solution providers, competitive product offerings, and a focus on granular business we are well poised to further our market share.

On the institutional front, the opportunity is humongous in the following segments education, healthcare, housing societies, NGOs, trusts given the multiple types of trusts, e.g.

We are adopting an ecosystem based approach to unlock the opportunity offered by each segment.

This entails systematically targeting the constituents of each segment and putting in place the relevant products, partnerships, digital journeys, solutions, and offers for the constituents of each segment.

We have the most extensive suite of payment form factors to offer to our customers be it Cards, POS terminals, payment gateways, UPI, QR etc.

With over 51 Million credit cards, debit cards and prepaid cards addressing every market segment, every third rupee spent on cards in India happens on HDFC Bank cards.

We are a leading player in credit cards with a strong growth and market share on both booksize ENR and spends.

We have built several strong digital offerings like PayZapp and plan to fortify the product offering in the coming year to provide strong engagement platform for HDFC Bank customers.

We will be providing strong unified experience across contactless payments, QR based payments, UPI payments, BNPL and digitalising all payment form factors with rich features in a unified platform.

Smartbuy is growing as a strong offer platform which aggregates strong offers from merchants and partners, providing a one view to the customer on all benefits which he she can avail exclusively as a HDFC Bank customer.

We have provided a strong loyalty framework and gained popularity among customers for getting accelerated reward points and rewards redemptions in a single platform.

To complete our suite of products and payment suite to the retail consumers, we are scaling BNPL with multiple variants that we are building to make customer purchases convenient.

Between Credit card EMI, Debit card EMI, paper financing we are riding the wave of innovation and have become No.1 among all banks in BNPL.

We plan to launch several new variants, customised solutions with large brands partners in the coming year.

We have extremely strong plans to also grow two new segments apart from retail consumers.

Commercial and SME payment solutions is a fast growing space and we have made strong carding and payment solution inroads into this segment.

We have several curated solutions being rolled out for Corporate SME segment and we will grow this segment by 2X in the coming 2 years.

Merchant Acquiring business provides the rail road for banking solutions and Payment offerings to the largest customer segment MSMEs.

As a Bank we have been leading this business for 15 years and despite the disruptive competition in this space, we have continued to grow and currently have over 47% market share.

Our focus is to grow our current 2 Million acceptance points network by 10X in 3 5 years.

Over the years our strategy has evolved in line with the competitive landscape and market opportunities, From focusing only on large and key merchants in the top 30 cities to expanding the industry by investing in digitising institutional segments like education, government and societies and taking the product range to deeper geographies to now focusing also on the small merchants and neighbourhood kirana stores and building partnerships, our strategy has continued to evolve.

In recent times with large fintechs and MNCs entering this space, our strategy has been further strengthened with two new pillars of Partnerships’ and Service and Experience’.

The success of this is reflected in our consistently growing market share and merchant engagement metrics.

To support this strategy we recently launched SmartHub 3.0 a comprehensive banking and payment solution range for all merchants.

This range of solutions allows merchants and self employed professionals to instantly open a mini savings account or current account and start accepting payments in store, online and on the go.

The solution range is tailor made for the size and segment of the merchant and consists of a vast range of offerings starting from rent free SmartHub merchant app and QR to personalised payment link option to a vast bouquet of POS devices.

This platform is further being expanded into a super app ecosystem with integrated servicing, integrated cash flow based lending, small ticket size flexible repayment loans, business cards and suite of value added services, offered in partnership with fintechs.

While the platform and ecosystem will ensure engagement and scale, with reducing transaction margins and need for higher investments, the business focus to generate revenue will be through a sandwich strategy’.

Under this strategy the payments layer in the middle will be ring fenced with a layer of liability offerings on one side and asset offering on the other.

These offerings will be for both the merchants and also the customers of the merchant, integrated seamlessly in the SmartHub platform.

This will help merchants improve their cash flow as Bank will enable funding affordability at transaction level on all its acceptance points.

This has multi level benefits to both the bank and the merchants Bank gets distribution point expansion and Merchants get cashflow benefit and also incentives from the Bank, thus creating a synergistic sustainable strategy for the Business.

We are doing this by leveraging our strengths and building for the future.

Some key aspects are: Continue to focus on scale to manage one of the largest franchises in the world creating infrastructure, partnerships and competencies for scale is a priority.

Fortifying our infrastructure and building for resiliency.

Focus of customer experience make banking easy for young and old, urban and rural.

Offering best in class experience for our existing and potential customers Bring in operational efficiencies build a highly productive workforce.

Build a safe, transparent and a regulatorily compliant technology led bank that citizens can trust.

Our approach is two pronged Run the Bank’ and Build the Bank of the future’.

Making banking easy, contextual and safe for our customers is our priority.

We have been digitising our customer journeys across the bank enabling easy onboarding, transactions and customer lifecycle management.

In parallel we are also building new capabilities and competencies to build the bank of the future.

As we realise the above objectives through multiple initiatives, we are also building one of the finest digital and technology capabilities in the financial services industry.

We are not only fortifying our enterprise IT but also building new muscle through our newly created Digital Factory and Enterprise Factory.

The new factories are bringing in new skills, new technologies and new ways of working.

Our transactions on mobile and net banking are increasing.

As our onboarding journeys become simpler and intuitive through the use of new engagement platforms, we see a higher preference and adoption for digital.

We are also leveraging data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for powering personalisation, credit underwriting and risk control.

Our underlying core technology infrastructure is being further fortified to make it resilient and scalable to handle the ever increasing load of digital transactions.

Our proactive monitoring of service paths and DevSecOps framework would ensure that we have a continuously integrated build and deployment pipeline to ensure agility, quality and security.

One of the important pillars of the Bank’s strategy is commercial and rural strategy which encompasses micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME SME), emerging corporates, the mid market companies, commercial agriculture and commercial transport companies.

This is the Bank’s fastest growing market group that contributes significantly to India’s manufacturing output, export, employment, supply chain network and infrastructure.

Constraints faced by the group include lack of easy or timely access to credit, high cost of credit and collateral deficiency.

The Bank aims to augment as well as facilitate the growth of individual ecosystems that exist within the group, (such as the rural ecosystem or the supply chain network), with products and services tailored to add value and financial strength.

Focusing on the commercial and rural group also supports the Bank’s goal of deep geographical penetration and expansion.

Using customised product offering, digital expertise and deeper geographical presence, the Bank is contributing to bridging the gap between India and Bharat.

The Bank continues its leadership position in Consumer Retail assets in various key and diversified product offerings like auto loans, personal loans and home loans among others.

The strengths built in these products by serving the large metro and urban customer base can be adapted to serve the needs of the large population in the Indian hinterland where consumer aspirations are increasing.

Their banking needs have to be assessed and addressed differently from the urban retail banking customers.

We have carved Retail Assets as a separate strategic pillar to ensure higher focus on this segment especially in deeper geographies where the growth drivers come from using digital advancement and increased geographical presence.

We will continue to focus on salaried segments within top rated corporates and government institutions across geographies and we believe that increasing aspirations will provide us a greater opportunity to cross sell our diversified retail products.

The Indian market is likely to grow at a better rate in the coming five years vs the last five.

This data is basis the emerging markets trends world over and with unorganised sector becoming more organised with bureau support the organised consumer financial sector will increase at a faster rate.

HDFC Bank, with a strong distribution in both open market and internal customer franchise with digital strengths is in the right position to leverage and grow across touch points and pincodes.

The Bank’s corporate banking vertical offers comprehensive banking solutions to corporates across industries and sectors.

This includes but is not limited to, large business houses, MNCs, companies in the manufacturing and service sectors, public sector enterprises, financial institutions, Global Capability Centres (GCC) etc.

The focus of the corporate cluster is to deepen corporate relationships with more attention being paid to their requirements on the funding side, with regards to their collections and payments, their trade related requirements or even the financial well being of their employees and key officials.

The strategy around our corporate cluster’ has been focused on serving the entire ecosystem of large corporates.

Using ground level intelligence about our customers’ processes, distribution networks, geographies etc.

The Bank already has host to host connectivity with the large corporates using APIs and is working towards digitising end to end transaction processing within their ecosystems.

The quality service offering that is provided to our corporate customers can be extended to customers and suppliers of the corporate using ecosystem banking’ with a view to bring the client’s entire financial world under one umbrella.

To digitise the purchase and ownership journeys of the company’s customers and 2.

To enable all sourcing to be digitally tracked and to use trade finance products to enable a better relationship with its supplier.

This initiative uses digital platforms, interfaces, data analytics, and our wealth of relationships to provide the corporate and its entire gamut of customers and trade partners, quick and easy access to financial solutions with an aim to increase product penetration at each corporate.

Diversification of the corporate portfolio is also a key driver of the growth of the corporate cluster.

A large proportion of wealth in India lies distributed even beyond the top 20 cities of the country.

The Bank’s strategy is to cover a larger geographical spread, to provide differentiated wealth management solutions using digital tools.

The Bank is creating new product offerings and improving its existing solutions to reach out to this population using technology.

With focus on wealth’ as a strategic priority, the Bank aims to increase its wealth management customer base significantly, in the next few years.

Our digital marketing strategy is to leverage it as an independent channel for end to end business generation.

Develop segmented and personalised communication based on highly advanced AI ML models.

Investments in advanced analytics tools on cloud have ensured we have a deep understanding of customer behaviour, and their preferences to curate personalised interventions, at scale and to create relevant customer engagement.

Investments in latest Martech solutions have been done to create frictionless digital journeys that allow customers to buy our financial products and services with zero or minimal physical interface.

We are closely linking customer understanding using technology to drive digitisation across the bank.

We have honed the ability to execute digital marketing plans at scale and in tandem with the traditional marketing channels so as to provide our customers quick and easy access to all our financial solutions.

We have created frictionless digital journeys for loans, deposits and payment solutions which allow our customers experience making a purchase in a few clicks.

This also helps us take our financial solutions to the under penetrated semi urban and rural segments.

Our Pay, Save, Borrow, Invest solutions will be part of these digital journeys, so that new and existing customers across segments can get instant approvals and purchase them without stepping out of their homes.

Subsidiaries Through its subsidiaries HDFC Securities Limited (HSL) and HDB Financial Services Limited (HDB), the Bank offers a depth of customer relationship with the complete breadth of products.

COVID 19 delivered a global economic shock, leading to a much wider macroeconomic impact than the global financial crisis of 2007 08.

The pandemic disrupted the real economy, and not just the financial system alone.

After a contraction of 3.3% in 2020, the global economy is projected to grow at 6.0% in 2021, aided by monetary and fiscal support extended by Governments and Central Banks, and the vaccination rollout.

Projected global economic growth in 2021 6% of restrictions imposed to contain the spread, and the magnitude of policy actions.

In the US, the fiscal package of 1.9 trillion is expected to bolster US economic growth and have a positive spill over effect on its trading partners.

Among advanced economies, the US is expected to surpass its pre COVID GDP level in 2021 and the UK’s economy is expected to reach its pre pandemic size in Q4 2021, while many others in the group are likely to return to pre pandemic levels only in 2022.

China has already returned to its pre COVID GDP in 2020 and India is likely to return to its pre pandemic level of output in FY22.

On the domestic front, the surge in daily COVID 19 cases is likely to impact a fragile recovery, with the relationship between lockdowns, reduced mobility and impact on growth being relatively strong.

An increasing number of states were forced to go into a complete lockdown or strict localised containment for a longer period of time, resulting in high impact on economic activity.

The Government and Regulators stepped in during the year to alleviate the socio economic effects of the pandemic and to stimulate growth.

Two such measures were the moratorium and the loan restructuring packages introduced by the Reserve Bank of India.

While the first allowed customers (from March to August 2020) to temporarily freeze loan repayments, the second eased the burden of monthly repayments.

A standstill on delinquency position as of February 2020.

Relief from making loan repayments during between March 2020 and May 2020 (Moratorium 1) and between June 2020 and August 2020 (Moratorium 2).

We operationalised the moratorium process through a robust multichannel customer outreach programme designed to guide customers in a frictionless manner.

Customers seeking moratorium were directed to our website to process their applications.

Loan restructuring The loan restructuring programme was aimed at easing the burden of monthly repayments for eligible customers who were significantly affected by the pandemic.

Customers seeking loan restructuring were allowed to reschedule their loan repayments and were offered lower payment structures, with extended tenors of up to 24 months.

We also conducted an outreach programme to help customers understand the modalities of restructuring and guide them through the process.

Our approach through the period was based on empathy, understanding and transparent communication as was evidenced by the scale and scope of relief provided to customers.

The Union Cabinet unveiled a stimulus package of 3 Trillion in May 2020 known as the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) in aid of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, (MSMEs).

This was aimed at addressing their working capital needs, operational liabilities and aiding businesses to restart.

HDFC Bank disbursed 29,622 Crore to over 1.23 Lakh customers in FY21 under the ECLGS scheme.

We have also emerged as a star performer under the ECLGS 1.0 and 2.0 schemes.

The stress on the banking sector was further accentuated by the pandemic.

Estimates suggest that 19 sectors that were previously not under stress before the pandemic have been hit, accounting for almost 15.5 Lakh Crore of debt.

Retail and wholesale trade being the worst hit with an estimated outstanding of 5.4 Lakh Crore.

The pandemic also affected 11 sectors that were already under stress.

These sectors have a cumulative debt of 22.2 Lakh Crore.

Of these, non banking financial companies (NBFCs) accounted for the bulk of the debt at 7.98 Lakh Crore.

The exponential spread of COVID 19 has led to the GDP growth contracting by 7.3% in FY21.

The pandemic has a significant impact on economic activities and lending potential across sectors.

Financial institutions using their strong liquidity position played a key role in reinvigorating the economy.

We actively reached out to large corporates for their funding requirements, which we could do because of our strong balance sheet.

Due to TLTRO scheme, we were able to raise funds at lower rates and further improve our liquidity position.

We also actively participated in lending to the MSME sector.

We continued our retail lending which capitalised on the revival in consumption in Q3 and Q4 to post a Y o Y growth of 6.7% in domestic retail loans.

The banking sector is facilitated by the network it has, whether with branches or physical availability of Bank employees especially in rural India.

New norms, state wise variations in restrictions due to lockdowns and fear of infection after easing of restrictions later in the year have affected all businesses including that of financial institutions.

Restriction on mobility has led to different ways of operating for employees and customers whether retail or wholesale.

There is an increased preference for contactless banking and operating remotely.

We started with initiatives to promote Secure Banking during COVID 19.

We conducted workshops to increase awareness on the rising cases of cyber frauds while making financial transactions and prevent them.

Our Mooh Bandh Rakho campaign was aimed to help prevent cyber frauds and the spread of COVID 19 by means of wearing a mask and keeping one’s mouth shut (Mooh Bandh Rakho).

In another initiative, we deployed 49 mobile Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) across 47 cities to assist customers during the lockdown.

One can conduct over 15 types of transactions using the Mobile ATM, which are operational at each location for a specific period.

We also launched video KYC to ensure full KYC savings account activation and onboard new customers.

To ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees, we undertook various measures such as providing sanitisers and masks, disinfecting and fumigating all offices.

We also set up COVID 19 medical helpline and deployed a dedicated team for providing updates to the employees on time.

For employees working from home, we provided the required IT support and put in place robust and secure systems and processes.

Demonetisation led to the faster adoption of digital payments post 2016.

Coupled with restrictions in logistics and physical movement induced by COVID 19, there has been a spectacular surge in digital transactions.

Further, large companies with a turnover of more than 50 Crore are mandated to offer prescribed electronic payment options from January 1, 2020.

In a recent notification, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has made e invoicing for GST, mandatory for taxpayers having turnover of over 50 Crore, from April 1, 2021.

We have witnessed a high adoption of fintech solutions in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector, which is mainly due to Government initiatives like demonetisation, GST, Digital India initiatives and growth in e commerce.

The pandemic restricted people to their homes, prompting fintech players to innovate and make their solutions more mobile friendly.

As corporate governance issues surface with increasing frequency, banks and financial institutions, along with the regulators, are looking at risks through the ESG lens.

Assessing the ESG health of the creditors is important to identify the inherent risks and take steps to mitigate them in order to preserve credit portfolio quality.

Climate change is one of the key ESG risks, with a potential disruptive impact on the economy.

It poses both physical and transition risks to our business, as the world transitions to a low carbon economy.

Thus, climate change is both a risk and a value creation opportunity.

We continued to invest in our intellectual capital, especially technology.

We have planned for upgradations in the short and medium term.

We have attracted talent in areas such as data anlaytics and IT.

Also, 178 external APIs are currently active on our API gateway.

All of this enabled us to increase our customer base to 6.18 Crore, acquire more merchants, and expand our market share.

We have increased our investments in technology and in designing solutions that are more user friendly and seamless.

Further, we are partnering with various fintech companies, as part of our strategy, to provide a differentiated customer experience.

Our response to climate change and ESG issues is three pronged.

First, we manage and mitigate climate change and ESG risks through our internal initiatives.

Second, we are developing a strategy to address climate change and ESG risks in our portfolio.

Third, we support our communities in enhancing their resilience to climate change and environmental risks.

We have set targets for tree plantation and to reduce our energy consumption and Green House Gas (GHG) emissions.

We have initiated steps towards implementation of TCFD and SBTi recommendations and continue our endeavor to acquire granular data and test tools for developing climate risk assessment and scenario analysis.

We also fund the development of renewable energy projects.

Our risk management process is flexible and allows us to adopt best industry practices and adapt them to our business needs.

We have adopted a multi layered risk management process to identify, assess, monitor and manage both traditional as well as emerging risks through the effective use of processes, information and technology.

Risk Governance The Board of Directors of the Bank takes responsibility for managing the comprehensive risks faced by the Bank.

The Risk Policy Monitoring Committee (RPMC) is a Board level committee, which supports the Board by supervising the implementation of the risk strategy.

It guides the development of policies, procedures and systems for managing risk.

It ensures that these are adequate and appropriate to changing business conditions, the structure and needs of the Bank and the risk appetite of the Bank.

The Chief Risk Officer heads the independent Risk Management Group (RMG) which drives risk management centrally in the Bank.

The RMG is primarily responsible for implementing the risk strategy approved by the Board, developing procedures systems for identifying, measuring, monitoring, assessing and managing risk.

The Chief Credit Officer heads the independent Credit Group overseeing the underwriting functions and approvals across retail and wholesale credit functions and ensuring that credit underwriting and portfolio management are aligned with the Board approved credit appetite.

The broad categories of risk we face are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk in the banking book and operational risk.

Further, our focus on digitisation leads to cyber security and data risk as well as reputation risk.

We are also exposed to Environmental, Social Governance risks arising out of the nature of business operations of our borrowers (particularly large, corporate borrowers), the industry segment in which they operate and the deficits in their compliance to statutory regulatory norms.

Risk exposures are actively captured and reported to the relevant levels of management for initiation of appropriate risk mitigation measures.

The Bank has a structured management framework for the identification and measurement of the various material risks that the Bank faces.

We are also continuously evaluating the efficacy of existing risk model assumptions and parameters and refining the models to reflect the new business normal.

The Bank has policies, processes and sound methodologies for the effective control and management of individual risks.

The Bank has put in place an overall Risk Appetite statement.

In addition, appetites for individual risk types are operationalised through risk specific policies and limit packages.

Stress tests form an integral part of risk analysis and computation of capital adequacy under severe but plausible scenarios that may adversely affect the Bank.

While each of these risks is assessed, monitored and managed under individual policies for day to day functioning, the stress testing framework endeavours to assist in identification of potential loss.

Our Board approved Investment Policy, Market Risk Policy and Limit packages cap exposure in line with the Bank’s risk appetite.

Operational risk arises from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.

Comprehensive Board approved Compliance policy in place.

An ESG policy framework has been formulated to address this risk.

Further, we have a robust Social Environmental Management System (SEMS) framework to address social and environmental climate change risks in our loans.

As a part of the ESG risk identification and mitigation process, we evaluate all our loans, irrespective of project type (greenfield projects or for regular capital expenditure), having a value of more than 10 Crore and a tenor of more than 5 years, for adherence to Environmental, Health, Social Safety (EHSS) norms.

We are exploring frameworks to model and assess climate risk.

We also continue our endeavour to acquire granular data and test tools for climate risk assessment and conducting scenario analysis.

On the Emissions front: we have taken targets to reduce our GHG emissions.

The Bank’s framework for liquidity and interest rate risk management is spelled out in our Asset Liability Management policy.

Further, a robust mechanism to comprehensively track cash flow mismatches under normal as well as stressed conditions and critical ratios including Basel III ratios has also been implemented.

To maintain healthy liquidity in comparison to balance sheet size of the bank to tide over any unforeseen stress scenario.

Every specific cyber threat including data privacy is assessed basis the framework (Identify, Prevent Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover) and controls such as firewalls, anti malware, anti advance persistent threats, data loss prevention, Red Teaming, Intrusion prevention detection, digital rights management, 24 7 security operation centre, and forensics solutions have been put in place.

The international general data protection regulation (GDPR)’ has also been implemented across relevant operations.

Facilitating growth via secure Digital initiatives.

Sustaining operational effectiveness and efficiency through secure Work from Home.

At HDFC Bank, we have always believed that business growth is intricately linked with prosperity of the communities we serve.

Our Holistic Rural Development Programme (HRDP) was born out of the conviction that the nation progresses only when rural India grows.

Our multi pronged interventions range from farm and non farm based livelihood, water conservation, on ground training for farmers, creation of Farmer Producer Organisations, sanitation to Natural Resource Management.

We facilitate livelihood enhancement opportunities, particularly for women and youth, primarily in agriculture and allied areas such as dairy and poultry.

The objective is to help them find jobs locally, enhance their household income and discourage migration.

Unemployment is a significant issue faced by many in the district of Idukki.

It’s more prevalent, however, in the underdeveloped hamlet of Maniyarankudy home to the socioeconomically marginal Mannan tribal community known for their unique customs and traditions.

To generate livelihood opportunities in the region, particularly among the women of the community, Parivartan established a tailoring unit and training centre after selecting and training a group of eight beneficiaries to run it.

The first batch of 10 trainees are now involved in teaching stitching.

Equipment provided to the centre by the Bank include furniture, tailoring machines, cutting machines, embroidery machines and other related accessories.

In addition to monitoring by field staff, the programme was also linked to the Start up Village Entrepreneurship Program (SVEP) so that it may be replicated across the state.

Each beneficiary chosen to run the centre, earns around 2,200 per month.

Upon completion of the 3 month training period, the trainees are expected to find sustainable employment thus setting in motion the gradual improvement of living standards in the region.

Our Sustainable Livelihood Initiative (SLI), a unique programme with possibly no parallel globally, is targeted at empowering families by empowering women through occupational skills training, financial literacy, credit counselling, livelihood finance and market linkage.

We also provide infrastructure support, such as building toilets in schools and improving classrooms.

At the community level, it also includes educating people on the importance of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH).

Also, through the Zero Investment Innovations for Education Initiatives (ZIIEI), we are committed to enabling teachers to innovate which in turn benefit students.

This programme is aimed at Government schools across India.

Parivartan is thus not just about bringing a sustainable change in the society, but also about delivering long term solutions for pressing social challenges.

Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time.

At HDFC Bank, we have been recording our GHG emissions since 2010 and are continuously transforming our operations to achieve low carbon growth.

Paper use accounted for about one third of our Scope 3 emissions in FY21 and is thus one of our priority intervention areas.

Our retail marketing team rolled out, Green Event Guidelines, through which we saved about 1.5 Million square feet of paper during the period under review.

We are also switching to recycled paper, which accounted for nearly 13% of our total paper consumption in the reporting period.

Our digital strategy has also enabled us to drastically reduce our paper consumption and helped avoid related emissions.

The Bank incorporated the 3Rs Reduce, Replace and Recycle in its retail marketing initiatives relating to on ground activations, enhancing visibility of the brand and product promotion.

We are implementing a very ambitious tree plantation programme.

So far, we have planted 1.6 Million trees, which not only helps sequester some GHG emissions, but also provides an opportunity to further improve our connect with the communities.

We have been able to achieve a consistent reduction in our absolute emissions, as well as in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission intensity over the years.

During FY21, not only our emission intensity (per Crore total income) decreased by over 27% Y o Y, but we also achieved a reduction of over 23% in absolute scope 1 and scope 2 emissions owing to our multi pronged initiatives to reduce GHG emissions, as well as the pandemic induced restrictions that resulted in some of our teams working from home, reducing the activity load at some of our operating locations.

Over 95% of our GHG emissions are attributed to energy consumption purchased electricity from the grid and diesel consumption in DG sets.

We are aggressively working to reduce our energy consumption across operations to complement our initiatives to decarbonise our energy consumption.

We have made significant progress in this regard, by regulating existing equipment, installing energy efficient equipment, and implementing automated energy management solutions, among others.

We have replaced over 12,000 conventional CFL fluorescent fittings with LED lights at 248 of our locations across 22 states and UTs, resulting in potential energy savings of over 1 Million kWh of electricity per year.

Henceforth, all building premises that we occupy will have only LED lights.

In FY21, we installed EC Fan Motors in 55 Air Handling Units (AHUs) resulting in potential savings of 0.2 Million kWh of energy per year.

We have also installed inverter ACs at our locations, which helped save over 1.75 Million kWh of electricity during FY21.

We also saved 32,325 kWh of electricity by installing VRF HVAC units at our back offices.

Disposal of old assets at three of our data centres led to the avoidance of 1.4 Million kWh of electricity during FY21.

Our Bangalore data centre Netmagic DC3B’ is a certified green data centre under the IGBC Green Data Centre Rating System.

IGBC Platinum Certification for our data centre in Bangalore cold aisle containment, replacement of old storages and servers and with new generation hardware, and implementation of Smart iPDUs. We have also adopted environment friendly measures at our data centres such as switching to R 407c refrigerant for INROW cooling, adoption of new fire suppression system with NOVEC 1230 gas, and replacement of UPS batteries with Li ion batteries.

We have incorporated several changes within our infrastructure to improve energy efficiency through auto controls and environment friendly equipment.

We have LEED Gold certified offices in Mumbai and Bhubaneswar.

In addition, new buildings in Mohali and Palava training centres are being constructed to meet the IGBC gold certification standards.

We have also implemented elevator and equipment scheduling to reduce our energy consumption, and installed occupancy sensors, capacitor banks as well as Building Management Systems at several of our operating locations.

The energy management module with auto controls deployed across select branches since FY19 resulted in potential energy savings of about 16%.

We plan to extend this initiative to an additional 2,000 branches across the country.

During FY21, not only our energy intensity (GJ employee) decreased by over 30% over FY20, but we also achieved a reduction of over 28% in absolute energy consumption.

The reduction in energy consumption is attributed to the comprehensive set of energy reduction measures implemented at our operating locations, as well as the temporary reduction in activity energy load at some of our operating locations as a result of COVID 19 induced lockdown and movement restrictions.

In FY21, we achieved a reduction of about 34% in absolute energy consumption, and 24% in energy intensity (GJ per employee) from base year FY19.

We are continuously increasing the share of renewable energy in our total power consumption.

We now have solar power plants at our operations across six cities Jaipur, Pune, Noida, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh and Mumbai.

During FY21, we commissioned a 52.8 KWp solar plant at our office in Mumbai, taking our cumulative installed solar capacity to 198.3 KWp, as on March 31, 2021.

To realise the potential of renewable energy, we endeavour to install solar panels in our upcoming office buildings wherever feasible.

Further, in some rural areas where power fluctuation is high, we have installed solar powered ATMs.

We deal with three types of non hazardous waste e waste, dry waste (paper waste) and wet waste (cafeteria, sewage), of which e waste is disposed of through authorised recyclers.

Hazardous waste within the Bank’s scope arising from diesel fuel oil used in generator sets, is negligible.

While we are progressively working to track paper waste from our operations, we have installed sewage treatment plants at some of our large office premises to treat wastewater before releasing it into municipal waste.

In FY21, we generated 167.88 tonnes of e waste, as a result of asset refresh, damaged and non functional assets.

We are also aggressively working towards minimising the use of plastic bottles.

We have already replaced all single use plastic water bottles at our hub offices across India with multiple use plastic bottles and glass jars in all meeting and video conferencing rooms.

We understand that our investment decisions may have an environmental impact.

We are thus committed to exercising our position to enable a positive impact on environmental sustainability and equitable growth through our investments and lending practices.

Environmental and social aspects are integrated into our overall risk assessment framework.

We do not fund projects that have an adverse impact on environment, health, safety (EHS) levels.

We do not lend to businesses that produce ozone depleting substances (CFC 11, CFC 12, CFC 113, Carbon Tetrachloride, Methyl Chloroform, Halons 1211).

As a part of our credit policy, we evaluate all loan applications with a ticket size of more than 10 Crore and a tenure of more than 5 years, through our Social and Environmental Management System (SEMS) framework.

In FY21, 463 loan proposals were screened and approved through the SEMS framework.

The Product Responsibility sub committee of our ESG Action Committee focuses on identifying opportunities in the environmental and social space, such as Green Bonds.

We aim to provide access to capital for environmentally sustainable projects that contribute to climate change mitigation.

We also finance renewable energy projects, and to date, have underwritten financing for a cumulative capacity of 2,945 MW amounting to 10,869 Crore.

We have also financed city gas distribution networks under the Minimum Work Programme, with a total underwritten amount of 5,308 Crore for 935 CNG stations and over 9.5 Million domestic connections.

In addition to our ongoing ambitious plantation programme, we promote the use of renewable energy through our social initiatives.

The Bank invests in providing solar home lights, streetlights and water pumps as part of its community development projects.

The solar water pumps are used in agriculture and for accessing drinking water.

As of March 31, 2021, more than 22,000 solar home lights have been deployed in rural areas, leading to potential avoidance of over 2,100 tCO2e per year.

We have also deployed over 9,700 solar streetlights across several villages, which would lead to additional avoidance of over 1,400 tCO2e per year.

We also help our communities by creating water conservation structures.

So far, we have supported construction of over 8,800 water conservation structures to enhance water storage capacity.

We also supported the construction of 23,500 household toilets, which will reduce the negative impact on the environment due to open defecation.

HDFC Bank acknowledges growing concerns of regulators, investors and clients arising from the climate risks facing companies, especially banks and financial institutions.

The Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) provides an important framework for identifying climate related risks and opportunities, evaluating appropriate responses and disclosing key information to stakeholders.

This is our second year working on the recommendations of the TCFD.

The Bank is exploring techniques to assess physical and transition risk of climate change.

We also continue our endeavour to acquire granular data and test tools for developing climate risk assessment and scenario analysis.

Further, we have been reporting on our climate change strategy, risks, opportunities and emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).

Our ESG Action Committee, through its sub committee on Product Responsibility will continue to focus on assessing Environmental Social (E S) risks, including climate risks in our operations while identifying new business opportunities in the E S space.

We, at the Bank, have a robust Risk Management Group (RMG).headed by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), which drives risk management centrally in the Bank.

The RMG is primarily responsible for implementing the risk strategy approved by the Board, developing procedures systems for identifying, measuring, monitoring, assessing and managing risk.

The Chief Information Security officer reports on updates from Business Impact Analysis and Disaster Response as well as cyber security concerns for the Bank.

The Bank's Group Head for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reports to the Board every quarter on updates from the Bank's sustainability (ESG) initiatives, chairs the management level ESG Action Committee that is functionally segregated into 3 sub committees for focused discussions.

A dedicated CSR ESG team, led by the Head, Corporate Social Responsibility ideates and implements several social and environmental programmes of the Bank that are aimed holistic development of our communities (Under the social umbrella of Parivartan’) environmental and sustainability reporting initiatives at the Bank, focuses on managing and mitigating climate change impacts through internal projects at the Bank, in partnership with the ESG Action sub committees (Infrastructure, Administration, IT and Risk teams at the Bank).

Besides, dedicated Administration and Infrastructure teams at the Bank effectively manage and procure Bank’s infrastructure and oversee the Bank’s energy efficiency and emission reduction initiatives.

The Bank has implemented a Board approved Stress Testing Policy Framework which forms an integral part of the Bank’s ICAAP.

Stress Testing involves the use of various techniques to assess the Bank’s potential vulnerability to extreme but plausible stressed business conditions.

Climate linked scenario analysis is being explored in respect of the tools and data specific to the country, to conduct climate specific scenario stress testing.

Given that climate risk is an emerging and long term risk for the Bank, we will consider adopting a suitable methodology pathway to analyse the Bank’s exposures under different climate scenarios.

The Bank has established Board approved credit policies and procedures.

Accordingly, the credit exposures are managed through target market identification, appropriate credit approval processes, post disbursement monitoring and remedial management procedures.

We recognise the inherent social and environmental climate change risks in our loans and hence in addition to financial and governance performance evaluation, we have an Social Environmental Management System (SEMS) framework for the assessment of social and environmental risks for all loan applications that are above 10 Crore in size and 5 years in tenure.

Our robust business continuity plan incorporates insurance of our assets in case of disaster occurrences.

We invest prudently in insurance and strong Business Continuity and Disaster Response systems.

Affected assets serving as collateral in case of our loans, also increase our credit risks and this is factored in our credit appraisal process.

We realise that lending to certain sectors like the agricultural sector have inherent credit risks as a result of delayed monsoons droughts.

We have taken steps to connect farmers to government initiatives and expert advice on weather, soil health and cropping patterns.

Banks are a highly regulated entity in the country and mandates as part of current regulations are always integrated into the overall risk planning and assessment process.

Current regulation is also factored in as part of the credit assessment process, especially through the SEMS (Social and Environment Management System) framework as part of which large loans are screened for environmental and social risks which also incorporates risk from violating environmental laws.

Transition risk can impact the Bank's credit portfolio resulting from changes in the climate policy, technology, consumer and market sentiment during the adjustment to a lower carbon economy.

This is particularly relevant in the case of policy changes that can result in loan defaults from certain sectors like coal, thermal and infrastructure.

The Bank is exploring techniques for developing climate risk assessment and scenario analysis to analyse our portfolio at risk due to transition risk of climate change.

While our digital environment and information security practices form the basis of our business today, being in the financial services sector, we do not anticipate technology as a risk type to cause considerable impact in climate risk.

However, our digital banking products (low carbon) have leveraged technology as a driver to enable business.

In case of large loans, the Bank ensures that the project complies with all environmental laws of the land, failure of which could lead the loan converting into a non performing asset in case the project enters into litigation for the same.

There are no other instances in which the Bank can be directly held responsible for climate related litigation claim.

In the context of overall risk management, market risks are managed through a well defined Board approved Market Risk Policy, Investment Policy, Foreign Exchange Trading Policy and Derivatives Policy that caps risk in different trading desks or various securities through trading risk limits triggers.

In the context of climate change, market could play an important role in shifting the demand and supply for certain products like green loans or bonds or in low carbon digital products.

Reputation risk from community customer perception is a primary risk to our business and hence we invest in community and customer engagement through surveys to educate and inform them about the Bank's initiatives towards Environmental Sustainability.

Further, the global investor community especially sovereign wealth funds and pension funds is increasingly factoring in ESG performance metrics to assess long term profitable growth.

We constantly endeavor to adopt environment friendly initiatives within our operations to demonstrate corporate responsibility.

We also demonstrate our commitment to ESG, especially climate change by incorporating ESG aspects in its regulatory reporting like the Annual Report.

Besides we also publish our GHG emissions and GHG footprint (third party verified) in our sustainability reports and our Integrated annual report going forward.

We also have a board governed ESG policy framework that integrates climate change strategy as part of our guidelines.

Acute physical risks can impact the Bank's credit portfolio through bad debts as a result of damage to property, infrastructure and land, increasing credit risks.

This is relevant also in the case of asset (that serve as collateral) destruction in the case of climate disasters.

The Bank is exploring techniques for developing climate risk assessment and scenario analysis to analyse portfolio at risk due to physical risk of climate change.

Besides, the Disaster Response and Business Continuity teams of the Bank conduct Business impact studies and have quick response mechanisms in place in case of scenarios like floods.

The Bank is exploring the availability of granular data and tools which can help model the long term outcomes of chronic physical risks.

Metrics and Targets Apart from monitoring impacts from our own operations, we intend to enhance our commitment to finance climate change solutions like energy transition, renewables, energy efficiency, sustainable transport, green buildings, climate smart agriculture etc.

We are in the process of defining KPIs and setting targets to help us monitor, manage and track progress towards our climate change strategy.

This also includes a comprehensive assessment of our scope 3 emissions.

Details on our metrics and targets have already been covered in the Environment section of the report.

Our unflinching commitment to keep customers at the centre of everything we do is reflected in the value and recall our brand enjoys.

As we cater to a diverse customer base from individuals to government, MSMEs to large corporates, and farmers to start ups we undertake various initiatives focused on delivering a distinct and quality experience across their entire financial journey with us.

No matter where the account is located, a customer can access superior banking services from any of HDFC Bank’s branches and ATMs. Access your bank account from the comfort of home or while on the move with our NetBanking and MobileBanking.

We have also improvised on the relationship based banking programs.

In addition to our branch based relationship managers, our Virtual Relationship Management (VRM) program helps to expand the horizon of providing customised solutions for various financial needs.

Ensuring product quality and service delivery becomes vital for business growth.

We desire to achieve this by seeking customer feedback as well as benchmarking with the best in class business entities.

We invite and review the performance on customer service as well as grievance redressal at different levels Branch Level Customer Service Committees (BLCSCs), Standing Committee on Customer Service (SCCS), and Customer Service Committee of the Board (CSCB).

We have put robust processes in place to regularly monitor and measure quality of service levels not only at various touch points but also at a product and process level by a specialised team called Quality Initiatives Group (QIG), which also works towards implementing strategic initiatives of the Bank through customer experience management.

As part of its continuous efforts to enhance quality of service, the Service Quality team carries out regular reviews, including mystery shopping, across various products processes channels by following a structured calendar.

Service Quality reviews span across all customer touch points.

Building a customer centric culture using Net Promoter System (NPS) Infinite Smiles’ We, at the Bank, believe that delivering an outstanding customer experience is a strong differentiator for a great product and is key to a sustained competitive advantage.

With this in view, we on boarded one of the top management consulting firms to help us develop and implement a Customer Experience (CX) programme called Infinite Smiles’.

This programme helps us establish employee behaviours and practices that leads to customer centric actions and continuous improvements, in our offerings, processes, and policies.

A system for bottom up measurement of customer loyalty is the cornerstone of this programme which has been operationalised through our high velocity, closed loop customer feedback system.

The measurement encompasses key channels Branch Banking, Virtual Channels and Contact Centres, critical episodes In branch transactions, Service Interactions, Query Request and Leads.

We contacted around 43.5 Million customers in FY21.

As a result, farmers have started sowing Rabi crops, leading to an increase in income and food security along with a decrease in seasonal migration.

The Sustainable Livelihood Initiative (SLI) is our flagship programme under Skill Training and Livelihood Enhancement through which we aim to create sustainable communities’ by empowering women and helping them break the vicious circle of poverty.

We support women by forming Self Help Groups (SHGs) or Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) by providing occupational skills training, financial literacy, credit livelihood finance, and market linkage.

We have started SLI EMI collections through Common Service Centres (CSCs) Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) providing customer convenience at the village level.

We have been actively championing the cause of Swachh Bharat through several sanitation projects with a focus on infrastructure creation, complemented by driving behavioural changes.

At the heart of these programmes are community led sanitation campaigns that promote hygienic conditions in rural areas through appropriate wastewater disposal.

We also organise health camps, nutrition programmes and vaccination drives.

Our health camps not only offer diagnostic services, but also assist the communities on other healthcare related aspects.

At the community level, we educate people about water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) and create awareness on road safety and healthy financial practices.

We also encourage dry waste management practices to improve and support resource utilisation, generate employment, and contribute to sustainable development goals.

To mitigate environmental and health issues arising due to improper waste disposal, we have partnered with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), India for dry waste management.

Through this initiative, we aim to create an ecosystem with 5Rs of waste management Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose and Recycle and bring waste pickers into the mainstream through social and financial inclusion.

We encourage our employees to contribute their time and effort to various social programmes under Parivartan.

Supporting the underprivileged We aligned our efforts towards supplying essentials to the migrant returnees and their families, as well as daily wage earners most affected by the COVID 19 induced lockdown.

First of all, wishing all of you health and happiness on behalf of the HDFC Bank family.

As the virus casts a shadow over the entire world, the first thing that all of us must do is take every possible step to ensure our safety and that of our loved ones.

Especially for all the frontline COVID warriors who served the nation, often at great risk to their own lives.

Our heads bow in respect for those who lost their lives in this fight.

It delivered a total rate cut (repo) of 115 bps since February 2020, taking the repo rate down to 4.0 per cent.

The central bank also took a slew of measures to address liquidity constraints such as the announcement of moratorium, liquidity infusion through TLTRO (Targeted Long Term Repo Operations) for NBFCs ( 500 billion), liquidity facility of 500 billion for mutual funds, liquidity support of 500 billion for all India financial institutions and a cut in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 100 bps to 3 per cent.

These measures helped anchor borrowing costs in the economy, support credit growth and cushioned the impact of the disruptions in the financial market (Please refer to the Macroeconomic and Industry section on page 128 for more details).

Needless to say, the pandemic affected the economy.

If FY 2019 20 was one of the most challenging years for the Indian economy, then the challenges only multiplied in FY 2020 21.

And this was accentuated further by geo political tensions.

The year started with one of the most severe lockdowns in the world.

Although it was eased in stages, the economy was bound to take a hit.

For the first time in many years, India’s GDP contracted by 7.3 per cent in FY 2020 21.

This was an improvement after the first quarter low of 24.4 per cent.

As the lockdown eased, the economy contracted by 7.4 per cent in the second quarter and touched positive territory in the third quarter, posting a growth of 0.5 per cent and 1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter.

The Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a host of measures to cushion the direct impact of the lockdown on the economy.

The Government announced a stimulus package of 20 trillion in five different tranches in FY 2020 21 to provide support to 1) the MSMEs and the Non Banking Financial Companies via a credit guarantee scheme and liquidity support 2) Migrant labourers via direct spending, and generating employment via enhanced allocation to MNREGA, 3) Small traders, vendors and farmers via loan facilities and 4) Announced structural reforms across sectors like coal, power, agriculture, etc.

On the monetary policy side, the RBI also took a number of steps to provide liquidity and enhance credit flow in the system.

The Budget announcements for FY 2021 22 too have given confidence to business with its focus on stimulating growth through expansionary fiscal policy at the centre and increasing capital expenditure at the central as well as state Government levels.

While all these have been clear positives, what has cast a shadow on the economy again has been the resurgence of the pandemic in many parts of the country, resulting in partial or complete lockdowns.

The mitigating factor has been the arrival of the vaccine and the decision to step up the vaccination drive by making all those over 18 years eligible for taking the vaccine.

The Government has invited more manufacturers from abroad to come to India to boost supply in the country.

In this uncertain environment, your Bank continued on its growth path by conducting its business responsibly and reinforcing its commitment to the environment and community at large.

Financial Parameters Your Bank recorded an improvement in a majority of its key financial parameters, largely due to its prudent credit evaluation of targeted customers and diversified loan book across customer segments, products, and sectors.

Managing risk return decisions with discipline also contributed to the Bank’s performance.

Net Profit at 31,116.5 crore went up by 18.5 per cent.

Net Interest Income at 64,879.6 crore rose 15.5 per cent.

Net Interest Margin remained stable at 4.1 per cent.

Gross Non Performing Assets (NPAs) at 1.32 per cent were among the lowest in the industry.

Parivartan Your Bank continued to transform lives through its umbrella CSR brand, Parivartan, which denotes change.

The Bank believes that businesses can only prosper if the communities in which they operate prosper as well.

This belief has inspired its social initiatives, which have potentially made a difference to the lives of over 8.5 crore people, predominantly in rural India.

Driving this change is the Sustainable Livelihood Initiative (SLI) team, which employs about 10 per cent of the Bank’s workforce and works exclusively on improving livelihood opportunities.

The Teaching The Teacher’ initiative has impacted over 2 crore students since inception.

The Holistic Rural Development Programme has touched another 20 lakh people across more than 1,970 villages.

Having an umbrella brand enables the Bank to lend a sharper focus to these efforts.

Your Directors are also happy to report that your Bank met the mandatory CSR expenditure through a spend of 634.91 crore.

The Bank contributed 70 crore towards Prime Minister’s CARES Fund to support the Government’s fight against the COVID 19 pandemic.

For further details on Parivartan please refer to page 88.

Summary In FY 2021 22, the pandemic and vaccination drive are critical factors for the pace of economic recovery.

In the near term, the resurgence of COVID 19 cases across the country does pose a risk to the pace of economic recovery but the absence of a national lockdown is a positive.

This, of course, poses challenges for your Bank in the short run.

In the long run, the market in the post pandemic recovery period presents tremendous opportunities, given the under penetration of banking services in the country.

Your Bank is well positioned to capitalise on these opportunities, given the strength of its major franchises.

It is also poised to make a greater contribution to bridge the urban rural divide be it through its business or social initiatives.

This, of course, will not be possible without the contribution of the ever growing family of over two lakh employees (including those of the subsidiaries) across the country, who remain at the forefront of taking your Bank forward every day.

Your Directors would like to especially thank those who went well beyond their call of duty during the COVID 19 pandemic to keep your Bank functioning.

Many of them soldiered on despite the loss of loved ones.

During the year, we also lost a few of our colleagues.

While we have structured a compensaton package for the families of the deceased, no word or action can adequately convey our sorrow.

Your Directors would also like to place on record that we did not reduce salaries during this trying period.

Your Bank paid bonuses and increments on time in the year under review and followed the normal promotion cycle.

Mission and Strategic Focus Your Bank’s mission is to be a World Class Indian Bank’.

Dividend The RBI, vide notification dated December 4, 2020, stated that in view of the ongoing stress and heightened uncertainty on account of COVID 19, banks should continue to conserve capital to support the economy and absorb losses.

The notification also stated that in order to further strengthen the banks’ balance sheets, while at the same time support lending to the real economy, banks shall not make any dividend payment on equity shares from the profits pertaining to the financial year ended March 31, 2020.

Your Bank did not declare dividend for the financial year ended March 31, 2020.

Given that the current second wave’ has significantly increased the number of COVID 19 cases in India and uncertainty remains, the Board of Directors of the Bank, at its meeting held on April 17, 2021, had considered it prudent to not propose dividend for the financial year ended March 31, 2021, and decided to re assess the position based on any further guidelines from the RBI in this regard.

Subsequently, RBI has, on April 22, 2021 vide its Circular mentioned that banks may pay dividend on equity shares from the profits for the financial year ended March 31, 2021, subject to the quantum of dividend being not more than fifty per cent of the amount determined as per the dividend payout ratio prescribed in paragraph 4 of the May 4, 2005 circular of RBI.

In view of this RBI Circular, the Board of Directors of the Bank, at its meeting held on June 18, 2021, has recommended a dividend of 6.50 per equity share of 1 each, for the financial year ended March 31, 2021.

This translates to a Dividend Payout Ratio of 11.5% of the profits for the financial year ended March 31, 2021.

In general, your Bank’s dividend policy, among other things, balances the objectives of rewarding shareholders and retaining capital to fund future growth.

It has a consistent track record of dividend distribution, with the Dividend Payout Ratio ranging between 20 per cent and 25 per cent, which the Board endeavours to maintain.

Management Discussion and Analysis Macroeconomic and Industry Developments The Indian economy contracted sharply in FY 2020 21 in the wake of the global pandemic, with GDP contracting by 7.3 per cent in FY 2020 21 as compared to a 4.0 per cent growth in FY 2019 20.

To recall, the World Health Organization declared on March 12, 2020 that the virus is a pandemic.

On March 23, 2020, the Government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, which got further extended till May 31, 2020 with some relaxations.

India enforced one of the strictest lockdowns at an early phase of rising cases to limit the spread of the virus.

Daily COVID 19 cases peaked in September touching a high of 98,000 and easing to 8,600 in early February 2021, due to introduction of social distancing norms, localised lockdowns and containment measures.

The Government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a host of measures to cushion the direct impact of the lockdown on the economy.

This helped GDP growth come off its low of 24.4 per cent in Q1 and 7.4 per cent in Q2 to 0.5 per cent in Q3 and 1.6 per cent in Q4 2020 21.

Looking at the internals, agriculture growth continued to remain positive (registering a growth of 3.6 per cent in 2020 21) due to the relative insulation of the rural sector from the virus.

Manufacturing growth contracted by 7.2 per cent in 2020 21.

However, the sector showed signs of recovery in H2 2020 21 with a contraction of 18.7 per cent in H1 2020 21 but picked upto 1.6 per cent in Q3 and 6.9 per cent in Q4.

Service sector remained a laggard with a contraction of 8.4 per cent in 2020 21.

Domestic demand began to show green shoots in the second half of the year as activity resumed.

Private consumption indicators such as production of consumer durables and non durables gathered pace in Q3 along with passenger vehicle (PV) sales that turned green in H2 FY21.

Encouragingly, GST collections rose to 1.23 trillion in March 2021, averaging 1.13 trillion in H2 FY21 as compared to an average collection of 0.76 trillion in H1 FY21.

The Government announced a stimulus package of 20 trillion in five different tranches in FY 2020 21 to provide support to 1) the MSMEs and the NBFCs via a credit guarantee scheme and liquidity support 2) migrant labourers via direct spending and generating employment via enhanced allocation to MNREGA 3) small traders, vendors and farmers via loan facilities and 4) announced structural reforms across sectors like coal, power, agriculture, etc.

On the monetary policy side, the RBI also took a number of steps to provide liquidity and enhance credit flow in the system.

The RBI delivered a total rate cut (repo) of 115 basis points (bps) since February 2020, taking the repo rate down to 4.0 per cent.

The central bank also took a slew of measures to address liquidity constraints such as the announcement of the moratorium, liquidity infusion through TLTRO (Targeted Long Term Repo Operations) for NBFCs ( 500 billion), liquidity facility of 500 billion for mutual funds, liquidity support of 500 billion for all India financial institutions and a cut in the CRR (Cash Reserve Ratio) by 100 bps to 3 per cent.

These measures helped anchor borrowing costs in the economy, support credit growth and cushioned the impact of the disruptions in the financial market.

Looking at the inflation side, CPI inflation averaged 6.7 per cent in H1 FY21 mainly due to higher food prices on account of COVID led supply disruptions.

Inflation eased below RBI’s upper band of 6.0 per cent from December 2020 to February 2021.

In FY 2020 21, the headline inflation averaged 6.2 per cent, above the RBI’s target range of 4 2 per cent.

In FY 2021 22, CPI inflation rose to 6.3 per cent in May 21 from 4.2 per cent in Apr 21, breaching the RBI’s upper threshold of 6 per cent for the first time in six months.

Apart from higher fuel and food inflation, a large part of this increase was driven by higher core inflation, possibly reflecting the impact of second wave related supply disruptions and a pass through of cost push pressures.

Going forward, we expect inflation to remain above 6 per cent for the next 3 months.

For FY 2021 22, we expect the headline inflation to average 6.1% led by higher commodity prices and sticky core inflation.

On the policy front, we expect the central bank to keep its rates unchanged in FY 2021 22 and maintain an accommodative stance.

The RBI is likely to only gradually reduce the liquidity surplus in the system once it is confident about the prospects of growth recovery.

The central bank is likely to continue managing the yield curve, especially the benchmark yield through open market operations (sterilised and unsterilsed) and the latest announced G SAP bond buying programme in order to contain borrowing costs in the economy and improve transmission.

In the financial sector, the onset of COVID 19 weighed down on credit growth while the deposit growth remained robust.

In FY 2020 21, the credit growth averaged at 5.9 per cent as compared to 9.5 per cent y o y in FY 2019 20.

The improvement in deposit growth could be reflecting pandemic related saving tendency among individuals.

Looking at the credit sectoral level, the weakness was recorded in the industry sector (large industries) while credit deployment to personal loans and to services sector rose albeit at a slower pace.

That said, the central bank estimates the ratio to increase to 13.5 per cent by September 2021.

The GNPA could escalate to 14.8 per cent if the macroeconomic environment worsens into a severe stress scenario.

Vehicles (SPVs) in which the Government had initially taken an equity stake.

GDP. Instead, the broad strategy of the stimulus is to remove bottlenecks on the supply side for the smaller and labour intensive firms to set off a virtuous cycle’ of more viable operations, increased production and employment, and higher incomes that would translate into enhanced demand.

The broad strategy of the Government’s stimulus is to remove bottlenecks on the supply side for the smaller and labour intensive firms to set off a virtuous cycle’ of more viable operations, increased production and employment, and higher incomes that would translate into enhanced demand.

To recall, the stimulus package worth 20 trillion (10 per cent the fiscal and other benefits that the segment enjoys.

In addition of GDP) announced by the Government had a clear focus on to the aforementioned measures, the Government of India the MSME sector, a key provider of employment in both the announced measures to facilitate capex and help businesses.

Measures announced included guaranteed collateral free of the domestic industrial supply chain.

The MSME sector credit support for 26 stressed sectors, 1.46 lakh crore boost that encompasses a wide range of industries had been under for Atmanirbhar manufacturing, Production Linked Incentive (PLI) considerable stress for a prolonged period before the incidence scheme for sectors such as electronics, textile, telecom, etc.

This made them particularly vulnerable to the additional outlay of 102 billion towards industrial expenditure, lockdown and its aftermath.

The NBFC sector, a major provider industrial incentives and development of defence equipment.

Thus, the stimulus package focused on the survival of both MSMEs and NBFCs through the COVID 19 crisis and also their revival.

The critical element of the stimulus was its attempt to facilitate the flow of credit to both MSMEs directly and to NBFCs.

The Government aimed to do this by reducing the risk taken by banks and other institutions in lending to them by providing explicit guarantees either on the entire loan or a fraction.

From the Government side, trend in capex has also been encouraging.

For the ongoing fiscal year, the Government has budgeted capex at an 18 year high of 2.5 per cent of GDP.

In INR terms, FY 2021 22 capex is budgeted at INR 5.3 trillion, which marks an increase of 30.5 per cent from the last year.

However, trend in services trade balance was encouraging.

Services trade balance improved to USD 85.1 Billion from USD 80 Billion in FY 2019 20.

Taking these factors into account, we expect current account to record a surplus of 1.0 per cent of GDP in FY 2020 21 vs a deficit of 0.9 per cent in FY 2019 20.

However, on a quarterly basis, we expect current account to record a deficit of 0.7 per cent in Q4 FY20 21.

Foreign flows remained strong in FY 2020 21 despite initial jitters in the market.

While gross FDI flows improved to USD 81.7 Billlion in FY 2020 21 as compared to 74.4 Billlion in FY 2019 20, FII flows recorded a net inflow of USD 30.3 Billlion vs. a net outflow of USD 5.1 Billion in the previous year.

With robust capital flows and a surplus in the capital account, we expect BoP surplus to improve to a record high of USD 100 Billlion in FY 2020 21.

Going ahead, with improvement in domestic demand conditions and higher commodity prices, we expect current account to record a deficit of 1.8 per cent of GDP in FY 2021 22.

As India emerges from the impact of the pandemic in 2021, it is expected to be one of the fastest growing economies in the world in FY 2021 22 with GDP growth expected to rise by 9.1 per cent in real terms.

We expect the economy to reach its pre pandemic output level (2019) by the end of the current fiscal year.

Growth is likely to be supported by higher capex spending by the Government, recovery in domestic demand and continued monetary policy support from the RBI.

For the next fiscal year, the pandemic situation and vaccination drive are critical factors for the pace of economic recovery.

In the near term, the second wave of COVID is likely to weigh on the pace of recovery in Q1 FY2021 22.

However, as the economy begins to open up, we expect recovery to pick up pace in Q2 FY2021 22 with support from both fiscal spending and continued monetary accommodation.

We expect the economy to reach its pre pandemic output level (2019) by the end of the current fiscal year.

Subsequently, the national lockdown was lifted by the Government, but regional lockdowns continue to be implemented in areas with a significant number of COVID 19 cases.

The impact of COVID 19, including changes in customer behaviour and pandemic fears, as well as restrictions on business and individual activities, have led to significant volatility in global and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease in global and local economic activities.

The slowdown during the year led to a decrease in loan originations, the sale of third party products, the use of credit and debit cards by customers and the efficiency in collection efforts.

This may lead to a rise in the number of customer defaults and consequently, an increase in provisions there against.

The extent to which the COVID 19 pandemic, including the current second wave that has significantly increased the number of cases in India, will continue to impact the Bank’s results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, among other things, any new information concerning the severity of the COVID 19 pandemic and any action to contain its spread or mitigate its impact whether Government mandated or elected by us.

In the year of the pandemic, the Bank disbursed about 2,000 crore in line with Government regulations which benefited over 1.42 lakh farmers.

The rural economy which primarily depends on agriculture was largely insulated from the pandemic.

This can result in considerable psychological stress.

So, several employee connect initiatives were recalibrated to a digital mode to bring in the much needed social bonding and recreational element at work.

Losses stem from outright default or reduction in portfolio value.

Your Bank has a distinct credit risk architecture, policies, procedures and systems for managing credit risk in both its retail and wholesale businesses.

Wholesale lending is managed on an individual as well as portfolio basis.

In contrast, retail lending, given the granularity of individual exposures, is managed largely on a portfolio basis across various products and customer segments.

For both categories, there are robust front end and back end systems in place to ensure credit quality and to minimise loss from default.

The factors considered while sanctioning retail loans include income, demographics, credit history, loan tenor and banking behaviour.

In addition, there are multiple credit risk models developed and used to appraise and score different segments of customers on the basis of portfolio behaviour.

In wholesale loans, credit risk is managed by capping exposures on the basis of borrower group, industry, credit rating grades and country, among others.

This is backed by portfolio diversification, stringent credit approval processes and periodic post disbursement monitoring and remedial measures.

Digital Lending and Credit Risk Driven by rapid advancements in technology, digitalisation is increasingly becoming a key differentiator for customer retention and service delivery in the banking sector.

Digital lending enables customers to secure loans at the click of a button in a matter of minutes, if not seconds.

However, there are also attendant risks associated with it and your Bank has put in place appropriate checks and balances to manage these risks.

Such loans are sanctioned primarily to your Bank’s existing customers.

Often, they are customers across multiple products, thus enabling the Bank ready access to their credit history and risk profile.

This facilitates evaluation on their loan eligibility.

Besides, most of the credit checks and scores used by your Bank in process based underwriting are replicated for digital loans.

The Bank has an independent model validation unit that minutely assesses the models used to generate the credit scores for such loans.

These models are monitored, reviewed periodically, back tested and corrective action is taken whenever needed.

Market Risk Market Risk arises largely from your Bank’s statutory reserve management and trading activity in interest rates, equity and currency market.

These risks are managed through a well defined Board approved Market Risk Policy, Investment Policy, Foreign Exchange Trading Policy and Derivatives Policy that caps risk in different trading desks or various securities through trading risk limits triggers.

The risk measures include position limits, tenor restrictions, sensitivity limits, namely, PV01, Modified Duration of Hold to Maturity Portfolio and Option Greeks, Value at Risk (VaR) Limit, Stop Loss Trigger Level (SLTL), Scenario based P L Triggers, Potential Loss Trigger Level (PLTL), and are monitored on an end of day basis.

As part of this process, your Bank has established various Board approved limits, both for liquidity and interest rate risks.

While the maturity gap and stock ratio limits help manage liquidity risk, net interest income and market value impacts help mitigate interest rate risk.

This is reinforced by a comprehensive Board approved stress testing programme covering both liquidity and interest rate risk.

Due to the moratorium on loans and advances announced by the RBI during the COVID 19 pandemic, your Bank has conducted liquidity stress under an additional stress scenario, assuming incremental moratorium availed by customers and the stress gaps were within the internal threshold defined.

Your Bank conducts various studies to assess the behavioural pattern of non contractual assets and liabilities and embedded options available to customers, which are used while managing maturity gaps.

Further, your Bank also has the necessary framework in place to manage intraday liquidity risk.

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a global standard, is also used to measure your Bank’s liquidity position.

LCR seeks to ensure that the Bank has an adequate stock of unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash easily and immediately to meet its liquidity needs under a 30 day calendar liquidity stress scenario.

While the RBI had provided dispensation to maintain the LCR at 80 per cent until September 30, 2020 and at 90 per cent until March 31, 2021 owing to COVID 19 pandemic, your Bank has consistently maintained the LCR well above 100 per cent.

Based on Basel III norms, your Bank’s LCR stood at 137.95 per cent on a consolidated basis for FY 2020 21.

Further, owing to the COVID 19 pandemic, your Bank evaluated the plausible Mark to Market (MTM) impact on the trading portfolio, assuming judgemental scenario shocks, and undertook frequent reviews of trading portfolio for optimised deployment of surplus liquidity within the Bank.

It is observed that at the onset of the pandemic, most of the asset classes became extremely volatile and the market witnessed significant correction in equities, weakening of domestic currency, surge in corporate spreads, etc under extreme risk aversion.

Subsequently, both the global and Indian markets showed a sharp recovery.

The RBI has also proposed a minimum Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of 100 per cent, which shall be effective from October 1, 2021.

The NSFR seeks to ensure that your Bank maintains a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of its assets and off balance sheet activities.

As a prudent risk management practice, your Bank has been monitoring this ratio, and is thus adequately prepared to meet the RBI mandated requirements.

The accommodative policy stance by the RBI during the pandemic has resulted in the system liquidity at elevated levels.

Your Bank also had a comfortable liquidity surplus during the year.

Given below is a detailed explanation under four different heads: Framework and Process, Internal Control, Information Technology and Security Practices and Fraud Monitoring and Control.

To manage Operational Risks, your Bank has in place a comprehensive Operational Risk Management Framework, whose implementation is supervised by the Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) and reviewed by the RPMC of the Board.

An independent Operational Risk Management Department (ORMD) implements the framework.

Under the framework, the Bank has three lines of defence.

The first line of defence is the business line (including support and operations).

The first line is primarily responsible for managing Operational Risk on a daily basis, in addition to implementing internal control related policies and procedures.

The second line of defence is the ORMD, which develops policies, procedures, tools and techniques to assess and monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of your Bank’s internal controls.

The team reviews the effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls within your Bank.

Internal Control Your Bank has implemented sound internal control practices across all processes, units and functions.

It has well laid down policies and processes for management of its day to day activities.

Your Bank follows established, well designed controls, which include traditional four eye principles, effective segregation of business and support functions, segregation of duties, call back processes, reconciliation, exception reporting and periodic MIS.

Specialised risk control units function in risk prone products functions to minimise operational risk.

Controls are tested as part of the SOX control testing framework.

This throws up operational risks such as business disruption, risks related to information assets, data security, integrity, reliability and availability, among others.

Your Bank has put in place a governance framework, information security practices and business continuity plan to mitigate IT related risks.

An independent assurance team within Internal Audit provides assurance on the management of IT related risks.

Your Bank has a robust Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery plan that is periodically tested to ensure that it can meet any operational contingencies.

There is an independent Information Security Group that addresses information security related risks.

A well documented Board approved information security policy and cyber security policy are in place.

Your Bank also has a well documented crisis management plan in place to address the strategic issues of a crisis impacting the Bank and to direct and communicate the corporate response to the crisis including cyber crisis.

In addition, employees mandatorily and periodically undergo information security training and sensitisation exercises.

Your Bank has put in place a Whistle Blower and Vigilance policy and a central vigilance team that oversees the implementation of fraud prevention measures.

Frauds are investigated to identify the root cause and relevant corrective steps are taken to prevent recurrence.

Fraud Monitoring committees at the senior management and Board level also deliberate on material fraud events and advise preventive actions.

Periodic reports are submitted to the Board and senior management committees.

Compliance Risk Compliance Risk is defined as the risk of impairment of your Bank’s integrity, leading to damage to its reputation, legal or regulatory sanctions, or financial loss, as a result of a failure (or perceived failure) to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards.

Your Bank has a Compliance Policy to ensure the highest standards of compliance.

A dedicated team of subject matter experts in the Compliance Department works with business and operations teams to ensure active Compliance Risk management and monitoring.

The team also provides advisory services on regulatory matters.

The focus is on identifying and reducing risk by rigorously testing products and also putting in place robust internal policies.

Products that adhere to regulatory norms are tested after rollout and shortcomings, if any, are fully addressed till the product stabilises on its own.

Internal policies are reviewed and updated periodically as per agreed frequency or based on market actions or regulatory guidelines actions.

The compliance team also seeks regular feedback on regulatory compliance from product, business and operation teams through self certifications and monitoring.

Liquidity Risk Liquidity Risk is the risk that a bank may not be able to meet its short term financial obligations due to an asset liability mismatch or interest rate fluctuations.

Operational Risk This is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. c.

Similarly, capital adequacy projections are formulated for the group after incorporating the business capital plans of the subsidiaries.

Your Bank has a structured management framework in the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) to identify, assess and manage all risks that may have a material adverse impact on its business financial position capital adequacy.

The ICAAP framework is guided by the Board approved ICAAP Policy.

Stress Testing Framework Your Bank has implemented a Board approved Stress Testing Policy and Framework which forms an integral part of the Bank’s ICAAP.

Stress testing involves the use of various techniques to assess your Bank’s potential vulnerability to extreme but plausible stressed business conditions.

The changes in the levels of Pillar I risks and select Pillar II risks, along with the changes in the on and off balance sheet positions of your Bank are assessed under assumed stress’ scenarios and sensitivity factors.

Typically, these relate, inter alia, to the impact on your Bank’s profitability and capital adequacy.

In the backdrop of the COVID 19 pandemic, your Bank developed a topical stress scenario to assess the impact of COVID 19 stress on Credit Risk, Market Risk and Liquidity Risk.

The COVID 19 pandemic crisis has been unprecedented, uncertain and continuously evolving.

Thus the underlying assumptions and building blocks of the stress methodology get modified depending upon how the pandemic evolves domestically and globally.

The stress results from this framework are deployed to ascertain the capital consumption under Pillar II risks as well as the overall impact on the capital adequacy of your Bank.

The COVID 19 pandemic crisis has been unprecedented, uncertain and continuously evolving.

The implementation is overseen by the Information Security Group and the Business Continuity Steering Committee which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO).

The Business Continuity Policy and Procedure defines roles for Crisis Management, Business Recovery, Emergency Response and IT Disaster Recovery Planning teams.

Ensuring Business Continuity during COVID 19 Team HDFC Bank rose to the challenge of delivering banking services during the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic.

Your Bank emerged successfully from the nationwide lockdown and adopted a hybrid approach of working from home, nearby location as well as base location in accordance with pandemic protocols that have been periodically released by the Government.

This has ensured that we continue to keep the safety of our employees as our first priority.

It was realised that the pandemic situation was going to be a long haul.

Therefore the teams adopted various continuity strategies like split operations, work transfer, people transfer and work from home to move from crisis mode to business mode and continue delivering services to customers.

This roadmap required these institutions to prepare IND AS based financial statements for the accounting periods beginning April 1, 2018 with comparatives for the periods beginning April 1, 2017.

The RBI, through its circular dated February 11, 2016, required all scheduled commercial banks to comply with IND AS for financial statements for the stated periods.

Banking Regulation Act, 1949 to make it compatible with the presentation of financial statements under IND AS.

Considering the amendments needed to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, as well as the level of preparedness of several banks, the RBI, through its Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated April 5, 2018, had deferred the implementation of IND AS by a year by when the necessary legislative amendments were expected.

The legislative amendments recommended by the RBI are under consideration by the Government of India.

The implementation of IND AS is expected to result in significant changes to the way your Bank prepares and presents its financial statements.

Instruments, are based on an Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model that replaces the incurred loss model under the extant framework.

Your Bank will generally be required to recognise either a 12 month or lifetime ECL, depending upon whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

IND AS 109 will change the Bank’s current methodology for calculating the provision for standard assets and NPAs.

Your Bank will be required to apply a three stage approach to measure ECL on financial instruments accounted for at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income.

For exposures which have not been assessed as credit impaired or where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the portion of the ECL associated with the probability of default events occurring within the next 12 months will need to be recognised.

For credit exposures where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but are not credit impaired, a lifetime ECL will need to be recognised.

Financial assets will be assessed as credit impaired when one or more events having a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that asset have occurred.

For financial assets that have become credit impaired, a lifetime ECL will need to be recognised.

Interest revenue will be recognised at the original effective interest rate applied on the gross carrying amount for assets falling under stages 1 and 2 and on written down amount for the assets falling under stage 3.

Conclusion It has clearly been the year of the pandemic.

While the country had barely come out of the first wave, the more dangerous second wave struck posing fresh challenges for the global and the Indian economy.

The presence of the vaccine is a clear source of comfort but there are challenges around its supply.

The proactive measures taken by the Union Government like allowing imports is expected to ease the situation.

As is the decision to go in for a centralised vaccination procurement and free distribution of vaccines to everyone above the age of 18.

Notwithstanding these challenges the Indian economy is expected to be among the fastest growing ones in the world.

The Union Government’s decision to put growth ahead of fiscal consolidation is another positive.

Your Bank of course cannot remain entirely unaffected by these developments.

It has certain factors in its favour : A strong balance sheet with among the lowest NPA levels in the industry, a franchise that inspires trust and capitalisation levels that exceed regulatory norms.

This means it can continue lending as well as innovate.

While there have challenges when it comes to technology, your Bank has initiated both short term as well as long term measures to overcome these.

The biggest opportunity is of course the under penetration of banking services in the country.

Changing global dynamics means that countries are increasingly trying to diversify and do not want want to put all their eggs in the China basket.

India is well positioned to capitalise on this opportunity.

Your Bank is also expected to benefit from these developments.

It will however not abandon the core principles of its journey of over a quarter century.

As always it will blend its quest for growth with caution so that there is no undue stress on the balance sheet.

The five core values : Customer Focus, Operational Excellence, Product Leadership, People and Sustainability will continue to guide us in this story.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Emphasis of Matter We draw attention to Note 43 of Schedule 18 to the standalone financial statements, which describes the extent to which the COVID 19 pandemic will continue to impact the Bank’s standalone financial statements will depend on ongoing and future developments, which are highly uncertain.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current year.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Our Audit procedures with respect to this matter included: dispute which involve significant judgement to determine the possible outcome of these disputes.

Significant management judgement is needed in determining whether an obligation exists and whether a provision should be recognised as at the reporting date, in accordance with the accounting criteria set under Accounting Standard 29 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets ( AS 29’), or whether it needs to be disclosed as a contingent liability.

Assessed the disclosures within the standalone financial statements in this regard.

The Reserve Bank of India’s ( RBI ) guidelines on Income recognition and asset classification ( IRAC ) prescribe the prudential norms for identification and classification of non performing assets ( NPA ) and the minimum provision required for such assets.

The Bank is required to have Board approved policy as per IRAC guidelines for NPA identification and provision.

The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine the identification and provision required against NPAs by applying quantitative as well as qualitative factors.

The risk of identification of NPAs is affected by factors like stress and liquidity concerns in certain sectors.

The provision on NPA is estimated based on ageing and classification of NPAs, recovery estimates, nature of loan product, value of security and other qualitative factors and is subject to the minimum provisioning norms specified by RBI and approved policy of the Bank in this regard.

Additionally, the Bank makes provisions on exposures that are not classified as NPAs including advances in certain sectors and identified advances or group advances that can potentially slip into NPA. These are classi ed as contingency provisions.

The management of the Bank also made an assessment of the impact on borrowers’ account due to COVID 19 pandemic and in line with the COVID 19 Regulatory Package announced by the RBI in respect of moratorium and restructuring of advances as relief measures to the borrowers.

Additionally, the Bank has considered the impact of judegment, on identification of NPA and provision thereof, which was vacated as per Honourable Supreme Court Order on March 23, 2021 and the RBI circular dated April 7, 2021 in that connection.

Since the identification of NPAs and provisioning for advances require significant level of estimation and given its significance to the overall audit including possible observation by RBI which could result into disclosure in the financial statements, we have ascertained identification and provisioning for NPAs as a key audit matter.

Tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls (including application controls) over approval, recording, monitoring and recovery of loans, monitoring overdue stressed accounts, identification of NPA, provision for NPA and valuation of security and collateral.

Testing of Application controls include testing of automated controls, reports and system reconciliations.

Selected the borrowers based on quantitative and qualitative risk factors for their assessment of appropriate classification as NPA including computation of overdue ageing to assess its correct classification and provision amount as per extant IRAC norms and the Bank policy.

Selected samples of performing loans and assessed independently as to whether those should be classified as NPA.

For samples selected reviewed the collateral valuation, financial statements and other qualitative information.

Considered the accounts reported by the Bank and other Banks as Special Mention Accounts ( SMA ) in RBI’s Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) to identify stress.

For selected samples assessed independently accounts that can potentially be classified as NPA and Red Flagged Accounts.

Performed inquiries with the credit and risk departments to ascertain if there were indicators of stress or an occurrence of an event of default in a particular loan account or any product category which needed to be considered as NPA.

Examined the early warning reports generated by the Bank to identify stressed loan accounts.

Held specific discussions with the management of the Bank on sectors where there is perceived credit risk and the steps taken to mitigate the risks to identified sectors.

Selected samples for standard accounts, default but standard accounts and overdue accounts and assessed compliance with RBI circular on COVID 19 Regulatory Package.

Selected and tested samples of accounts which were restructured under MSME restructuring circular and Resolution Framework for COVID 19 related stress circular for their compliance with the RBI directions and.

Selected samples of accounts which were not declared as NPA due to the interim order of Honourable Supreme Court and later on due to the vacation of the interim order and the RBI circular in that connection to ensure the asset classification of borrower accounts has been continued as per the extant RBI instructions IRAC norms.

Assessed the adequacy of disclosures against the relevant accounting standards and RBI requirements relating to NPAs.

The Bank has a complex IT architecture to support its day to day business operations.

High volume of transactions is processed and recorded on single or multiple applications.

The reliability and security of IT systems plays a key role in the business operations of the Bank.

Since large volume of transactions are processed daily, the IT controls are required to ensure that applications process data as expected and that changes are made in an appropriate manner.

Appropriate IT general controls and application controls are required to ensure that such IT systems are able to process the data, as required, completely, accurately and consistently for reliable financial reporting.

We have identified IT systems and controls’ as key audit matter because of the high level automation, significant number of systems being used by the management and the complexity of the IT architecture and its impact on the financial reporting system.

The team also assisted in testing the accuracy of the information produced by the Bank’s IT systems.

Obtained a comprehensive understanding of IT applications landscape implemented at the Bank.

It was followed by process understanding, mapping of applications the same and understanding financial risks posed by people process and technology.

Key IT audit procedures includes testing design and operating effectiveness of key controls operating over user access management (which includes user access provisioning, de provisioning, access review, password configuration review, segregation of duties and privilege access), change management (which include change release in production environment are compliant to the defined procedures and segregation of environment is ensured), program development (which include review of data migration activity), computer operations (which includes testing of key controls pertaining to, backup, Batch processing (including interface testing), incident management and data centre security), System interface controls.

This included testing that requests for access to systems were appropriately logged, reviewed and authorized.

Also, entity level controls pertaining to policy and procedure and Business continuity plan assessment due impact of COVID 19 was also part of our audit procedure.

In addition to the above, the design and operating effectiveness of certain automated controls, that were considered as key internal system controls over financial reporting were tested.

Using various techniques such as inquiry, review of documentation record reports, observation and re performance.

We also tested few controls using negative testing technique.

We had taken adequate samples of instances for our test.

Tested compensating controls and performed alternate procedures, where necessary.

In addition, understood where relevant, changes made to the IT landscape during the audit period.

These include forwards, swaps, futures and options.

The notional amounts of financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with the instruments recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks.

The following sections outline the nature and terms of the derivative transactions generally undertaken by the Bank.

Interest rate contracts Forward rate agreements give the buyer the ability to determine the underlying rate of interest for a specified period commencing on a specified future date (the settlement date).

The underlying rate of interest could be an interest rate curve, interest rate index or bond yield.

There is no exchange of principal and settlement is effected on the settlement date.

The settlement amount is the difference between the contracted rate and the market rate prevailing on the settlement date discounted for the interest period of the agreement.

Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of interest obligations with the counterparty for a specified period without exchanging the underlying (or notional) principal.

Interest rate caps and floors give the buyer the ability to fix the maximum or minimum rate of interest.

The writer of the contract pays the amount by which the market rate exceeds or is less than the cap rate or the floor rate respectively.

A combination of interest rate caps and floors can create structures such as interest rate collar, cap spreads and floor spreads.

Interest rate futures are standardised interest rate derivative contracts traded on a recognised stock exchange to buy or sell a notional security or any other interest bearing instrument or an index of such instruments or interest rates at a specified future date, at a price determined at the time of the contract.

Exchange rate contracts Forward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell fixed amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on future date.

These instruments are carried at fair value, determined based on either FEDAI rates or market quotations.

Cross currency swaps are agreements to exchange principal amounts denominated in different currencies.

Cross currency swaps may also involve the exchange of interest payments on one specified currency for interest payments in another specified currency for a specified period.

Currency options (including Exchange Traded Currency Option) give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right but not an obligation, to buy or sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future date.

Scope of the Bank’s Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Policy of the Bank includes within its scope all business lines and functions, and all permanent staff in the Bank’s domestic as well as international offices.

The principles articulated in the compensation policy are applicable uniformly across the Bank.

However, any statutory regulatory provisions applicable in overseas locations take precedence over the Remuneration Policy of the Bank.

All permanent employees of the Bank except those covered under the long term wage agreement are covered by the said Remuneration Policy.

The number of employees covered under the compensation policy was 1,19,858 as at March 31, 2021 (previous year: 1,16,726).

The ultimate objective of the Policy is to provide a fair and transparent structure that helps in acquiring and retaining the talent pool critical to build competitive advantage and brand equity.

The Policy has been designed basis the principles for sound compensation practices in accordance with regulatory requirements and provides a framework to create, modify and maintain appropriate compensation programs and processes with adequate supervision and control.

The Bank’s performance management system provides a sound basis for assessing employee performance holistically.

The Bank’s compensation framework is aligned with the performance management system and differentiates pay appropriately amongst its employees based on degree of contribution, performance, skill, experience, grade and availability of talent owing to competitive market forces.

Further, the Bank also considers compliance to processes, regulatory compliance and risk management as an integral part of its performance appraisal process.

These factors are given due weightage for the purposes of the final performance rating of employees for a given performance year.

The NRC considers the aforementioned principles enunciated in the Bank’s compensation policy and ensures that: (a) (b) compensation outcomes are symmetric with risk outcomes (c) compensation payouts are sensitive to the time horizon of risk and (d) the mix of cash, equity and other forms of compensation are aligned with risk.

Review of Remuneration Policy of the Bank The Remuneration Policy of the Bank was reviewed by the NRC during the year ended March 31, 2021 and changes were made to the policy in accordance with the revised guidelines on compensation of Whole Time Directors Chief Executive Officers Material Risk Takers and Control Function staff issued on dated November 4, 2019.

These guidelines are applicable for the performance year commencing on April 1, 2020 and shall govern all remuneration payouts subsequent to March 31, 2021.

The key changes have been articulated at para G Key changes to the Remuneration Policy pursuant to the revised guidelines on remuneration issued by the RBI on November 4, 2019, below.

The Remuneration Policy ensures that the fixed component of the compensation is reasonable, taking into account all relevant factors including industry practice.

Elements of Fixed Pay The fixed pay component of the Bank’s compensation structure typically consists of elements such as base salary, allowances, perquisites and retirement benefits.

Perquisites extended are in the nature of company car, hard furnishing, company leased accommodation, club membership and such other benefits or allowances in lieu of such perquisites benefits.

Retirement benefits include contributions to provident fund, superannuation fund (for employees above certain job bands), national pension scheme and gratuity.

The Whole Time Directors of the Bank are entitled to other post retirement benefits such as car and medical facilities, in accordance with specified terms of their employment, subject to RBI approval.

The quantum of fixed pay for Whole Time Directors is approved by the NRC and the Board, and is subject to the approval of the RBI.

The performance management system forms the basis for variable pay allocation of the Bank.

The Remuneration Policy of the Bank ensures that the performance management system is comprehensive and considers both, quantitative and qualitative performance measures.

The bonus for Whole Time Directors does not exceed 70% of the fixed pay in a year, thereby ensuring that there is a balance between the fixed and variable pays.

The variable pay for Whole Time Directors is approved by the NRC as well as the Board and is subject to the approval of the RBI.

The criteria for negative contribution are decided basis pre defined financial benchmarks.

The Bank has in place appropriate methods for prevention of vesting of deferred variable pay or any part thereof, on account of negative contribution.

Under the malus clause the incumbent foregoes the payout of the deferred variable pay in full or in part.

Under the claw back clause the incumbent is obligated to return all the tranches of payout received of bonus amounts pertaining to the relevant performance year.

The deferred bonus is paid out post review and approval by the NRC.

The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the business unit, performance of the individual employee, job band of the employee and the functional category.

Basis these key determinants and due adjustment for risk alignment, a payout matrix for variable pay is developed.

Market trends for specific businesses functions along with inputs from compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the payout.

Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in both the quantum and the method of payout across functions.

Typically higher levels of responsibility receive a higher proportion of variable pay vis vis fixed pay.

The Bank ensures that the time horizon for risk is assessed and the deferment period, if any, for bonus is set accordingly.

In the event the proportion of variable pay exceeds 50% of fixed pay for employees in certain grades, the Bank has devised the following deferment schedule after taking into consideration the nature of risk, time horizon of risk, and the materiality of risk.

In cases of deferment of variable pay, the Bank makes an assessment prior to the due date for payment of the deferred portion for any negative contribution.

The criteria for negative contribution are decided basis pre defined financial benchmarks.

The Bank has in place appropriate methods for prevention of vesting of deferred variable pay or any part thereof, on account of negative contribution.

The Bank also has in place claw back arrangements in relation to amounts already paid in the eventuality of a negative contribution.

All PLP payouts are based on a balanced scorecard framework which factors not just quantitative, but also qualitative measures, such as quality of business sourced, customer complaints etc., and are subject to achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees.

A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks.

Employees who are on the PLPs are excluded from the Annual Bonus Plan.

Guaranteed bonuses are not consistent with sound risk management or pay for performance principles of the Bank and therefore do not form an integral part of the general compensation practice.

For critical hiring for some select strategic roles, the Bank may consider granting of bonus, based on the performance rating upon confirmation, as a prudent way to avoid loading the entire cost of attraction into the fixed component of the compensation which could have a long term cost implication for the Bank.

For such hiring, the said bonus is generally decided by taking into account appropriate risk factors and market conditions.

The Bank considers ESOPs as a vehicle to create a balance between short term rewards and long term sustainable value creation.

ESOPs play a key role in the attraction and retention of key talent.

The Bank grants equity share options to its Whole Time Directors and other employees above a certain grade.

All plans for grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank.

These plans provide for the grant of options post approval by the NRC.

The NRC grants options after considering parameters such as the incumbent’s grade and performance rating, and such other factors as may be deemed appropriate by the NRC. Equity share options granted to the Whole Time Directors are also subject to the approval of the NRC, the Board of Directors of the Bank and the RBI.

Such ESOPs vest over four tranches spread over a period of 48 months.

The ESOPs granted subsequent to April 1, 2019 vest no faster than on a pro rata basis.

Some employees are also paid statutory bonus as per the Payment of Bonus Act (1965) as amended from time to time.

III. Remuneration Processes Fitment at the time of Hire Pay scales at the Bank are set basis the job size, experience, location and the academic and professional credentials of the incumbent.

The compensation of new hires is in line with the existing pay ranges and consistent with the compensation levels of the existing employees of the Bank at similar profiles.

The pay ranges are subject to change basis market trends and the Bank’s talent management priorities.

While the Bank believes in the internal equity and parity as a key determinant of pay, it does acknowledge the external competitive pressures of the talent market.

Accordingly, there could be certain key profiles with critical competencies which may be hired at a premium and treated as an exception to the overall pay philosophy.

Any deviation from the defined pay ranges is treated as a hiring exception requiring approval with appropriate justification.

In order to enhance the Bank’s external competitiveness, it participates in an annual salary survey of the banking sector to understand key market trends as well as get insights on relative market pay position compared to peers.

The Bank endeavors to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of fixed pay over time.

This coupled with key internal data indicators like performance score, job family, experience, job grade and salary budget form the basis of decision making on revisions in fixed pay.

Increments in fixed pay for majority of the employee population are generally undertaken once every financial year.

However, promotions, confirmations and change in job dimensions could also lead to a change in the fixed pay during other times of the financial year.

The Bank also makes salary corrections and adjustments during the financial year for competitive pay positioning of those employees who have a good performance track record.

However, such pay revisions are done on an exception basis.

Risk, Control and Compliance Staff The Bank has separated the Risk, Control and Compliance functions from the Business functions in order to create a strong culture of checks and balances and to eliminate any possible conflict of interest between revenue generation and risk management and control.

Accordingly, the overall variable pay as well as the annual salary increment of the employees in the Risk, Control and Compliance functions is based on their performance, functional objectives and goals.

The Bank ensures that the mix of fixed to variable compensation for these functions is weighted in favour of fixed compensation.

C. Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into account in the remuneration processes, including the nature and type of the key measures used to take account of these risks The Bank takes into account various types of risks in its remuneration processes.

The Bank follows a comprehensive framework that includes within its ambit the key dimensions of remuneration such as fixed pay, variable pay and long term incentives (i.e.

Fixed pay: The Bank conducts a comprehensive market benchmarking study to ensure that employees are competitively positioned in terms of fixed pay.

The Bank follows a robust salary review process wherein revisions in fixed compensation are based on performance.

Through this approach the Bank endeavors to ensure that the talent risk due to attrition is mitigated.

Fixed pay could be revised downwards as well, in the event of certain proven cases of misconduct by an employee.

All quarterly monthly PLP plans are based on the principle of balanced scorecard framework that includes within its ambit both quantitative and qualitative factors including key strategic objectives that ensure future competitive advantage for the Bank.

PLP plans, by design, have deterrents that play a role of moderating payouts based on the non fulfillment of established quantitative qualitative risk factors.

Deterrents also include risks arising out of non compliance, mis sell etc.

Further, a portion of all payouts under the PLP plans is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks.

Employees who are part of the PLP plans are excluded from the Annual Bonus Plan.

The Bank takes into consideration the fact that a portion of the Bank’s profits are directly attributable to various types of risks the Bank is exposed to such as credit risk, market risk, operational risk and other quantifiable risks.

The framework developed by the Bank in order to arrive at the quantum of bonus pool is based on the performance of the Bank and profitability.

The annual bonus is distributed based on business unit and individual performance and job band and role of the individual for non business functions.

The business unit performance is based on factors such as growth in revenue, growth in profit, cost to income ratio and achievement vis vis plans and key objectives.

Bonus pay out for an individual employee in a particular grade is linked to the performance rating of the employee and subject to meeting the Bank’s standards of ethical conduct.

The Bank has devised appropriate malus and claw back clauses as a risk mitigant for any negative contributions of the Bank and or relevant line of business in any year for Whole Time Directors and employees in certain grades.

Under the malus clause the incumbent foregoes the vesting of the deferred variable pay in full or in part.

Digital Transformation This includes performance on initiatives required to run the bank and grow the bank 5.

Improvement in cost to income over the previous year and h) Achievement of key strategic objectives.

The Bank reviews the fixed pay portion of the compensation structure basis merit based increments and market corrections.

These are based on a combination of performance rating, job band and the functional category of the individual employee.

For a given job band, the merit increment is directly related to the performance rating.

The Bank strives to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of fixed pay over time.

All other things remaining equal, the correction percentage is directly related to the performance rating of the individual.

The Bank’s annual bonus is computed as a percentage of the gross salary for every job band.

The bonus multiple is based on performance of the business unit (based on the parameters above), performance rating, job band and the functional category of the individual employee.

The business performance level determines the multiplier for the bonus.

All other things remaining equal, for a given job band, the bonus is directly related to the performance rating.

Employees on the annual bonus plan are not part of the PLPs.

The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales personnel who are given sales targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology.

All PLP payouts are subject to the achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated by qualitative parameters.

The Bank will ensure that there is a proper balance between cash and share linked instruments in the variable pay.

In cases where compensation by way of share linked instruments is not permitted by law regulations, the entire variable pay will be in cash within the prescribed limits.

This is in line with the principle that at higher levels of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay is higher.

The total variable pay is limited to a maximum of 300% of the fixed pay (for the relative performance period).

As aforementioned, the variable pay will be inclusive of cash as well as share linked instruments.

In case the variable pay is up to 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay, and in the case of variable pay being above 200%, a minimum of 67% thereof, shall be via non cash instruments.

In the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share linked instruments, his her variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay.

For its MRTs, the Bank has in place deferral arrangements for the variable pay.

A minimum of 60% of total variable pay will be under deferral arrangements.

If the cash component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus will be deferred.

In cases where cash component of the bonus is under 0.25 crore, the deferral arrangements would not be necessary.

The deferral period is a minimum of three years and applicable to both cash and non cash components of variable pay.

The deferral period for share linked instruments ESOPs is governed by the ESOP Scheme Rules approved by the NRC and the Board.

Further, the malus and clawback conditions were reviewed by the NRC and the Board in light of the revised guidelines on remuneration.

The Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking.

The Bank, therefore, has devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment.

Clawback Arrangement: The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward (variable pay LTI) made in the previous years attributable to a given reference year wherein the incident has occurred.

The occurrence of any some all of the following conditions (illustrative) shall trigger a review by the NRC for the application of the malus or the clawback arrangement: i.

Substantial financial deterioration in profitability or risk parameters ii.

Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior iii.

Performing Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public disclosure, the bank shall not pay the unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment year under malus’ arrangement.

Further, in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for the assessment year) shall be entertained.

In case the Bank’s post assessment Gross NPAs are less than 2.0%, these restrictions will apply only if criteria for public disclosure are triggered either on account of divergence in provisioning or both provisioning and asset classification.

The NRC may decide to apply malus on part, or all of the unvested deferred bonus amounts and LTIs. The time horizon for the application of malus clawback clause is four years from the date of reward.

Whole Time Director Material Risk Taker prior to applying the malus or clawback arrangement.

The criteria for malus clawback arrangement shall be reviewed by the NRC annually.

The ESOPs that would be granted to MRTs in the financial year commencing on April 1, 2021, in respect of the reference performance financial year ended on March 31, 2021, shall be reckoned as part of their variable pay in accordance with the revised guidelines on remuneration.

The objective of the LCR is to promote the short term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks.

It does this by ensuring that banks have an adequate stock of unencumbered high quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be converted easily and immediately into cash to meet their liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario.

The LCR is expected to improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy.

The Liquidity Risk Management of the Bank is governed by the Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy approved by the Board.

The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest rate risk management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence to the risk tolerance limits set by the Board.

In order to determine cash outflows, the Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments, viz Retail (which include deposits from individuals), Small Business Customers (those with deposits under 5 crore), and Wholesale (which would cover all residual deposits).

Within Wholesale, deposits that are attributable to clearing, custody, and cash management services are classified as Operational Deposits.

Other contractual funding, including a portion of other liabilities which are expected to run down in a 30 day time frame are included in the cash outflows.

These classifications, based on extant regulatory guidelines, are part of the Bank’s LCR framework, and are also submitted to the RBI.

The LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank’s stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30 day stress period.

The guidelines for LCR were effective January 1, 2015, with the minimum requirement at 60% which would rise in equal annual steps to reach 100% on January 1, 2019.

This graduated approach was designed to ensure that the LCR could be introduced without material disruption to the orderly strengthening of banking systems or the ongoing financing of economic activity.

In the Indian context, the run off factors for the stressed scenarios are prescribed by the RBI, for various categories of liabilities (viz., deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), undrawn commitments, derivative related exposures, and offset with inflows emanating from assets maturing within the same time period.

The average LCR for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 was at 137.24% as against 132.20% for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, and well above the present prescribed minimum requirement of 90%.

The average HQLA for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 was 387,444.92 crore, as against was 281,400.84 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.

During the same period the composition of government securities and treasury bills in the HQLA was at 89.49% as compared to 91% in the previous year.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, derivative exposures (net of cash inflows) collateral requirements and undrawn commitments constituted just about 0.25% and 2.45% respectively of average cash outflow.

The Bank has consistently maintained a robust funding profile with a significant portion of funding through deposits.

The impact of COVID 19, including changes in customer behaviour and pandemic fears, as well as restrictions on business and individual activities, has led to significant volatility in global and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease in global and local economic activities.

The slowdown during the year led to a decrease in loan originations, the sale of third party products, the use of credit and debit cards by customers and the efficiency in collection efforts.

This may lead to a rise in the number of customer defaults and consequently an increase in provisions thereagainst.

The extent to which the COVID 19 pandemic, including the current second wave that has significantly increased the number of cases in India, will continue to impact the Bank’s results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, among other things, any new information concerning the severity of the COVID 19 pandemic and any action to contain its spread or mitigate its impact whether government mandated or elected by us.

HDFC Bank Limited Consequent to the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic, the Indian government announced a lockdown in March 2020.

Subsequently, the national lockdown was lifted by the government, but regional lockdowns continue to be implemented in areas with a significant number of COVID 19 cases.

The impact of COVID 19, including changes in customer behaviour and pandemic fears, as well as restrictions on business and individual activities, has led to significant volatility in global and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease in global and local economic activities.

The slowdown during the year led to a decrease in loan originations, the sale of third party products, the use of credit and debit cards by customers and the efficiency in collection efforts.

This may lead to a rise in the number of customer defaults and consequently an increase in provisions thereagainst.

The extent to which the COVID 19 pandemic, including the current second wave that has significantly increased the number of cases in India, will continue to impact the Bank’s results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, among other things, any new information concerning the severity of the COVID 19 pandemic and any action to contain its spread or mitigate its impact whether government mandated or elected by us.

Further, the Company holds provisions as at March 31, 2021 against the potential impact of COVID 19 based on the information available at this point in time.

The extent to which the COVID 19 pandemic will impact the Company’s financial performance is dependent on future developments, which are highly uncertain.

The impact of the global health pandemic may be different from that estimated at the date of approval of these financial results and the Company will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions.

Sustainability Highlights

“UPS’s shareholders, customers, suppliers, communities and employees care about sustainability, and so do we. And 

that’s why we’re focused on hitting our 2025 goals on our road to carbon neutrality by 2050 and improving 1 billion 

lives by 2040. We have data-driven action plans to invest in planet-friendly solutions while taking care of our people 

and serving our customers and communities of today and tomorrow. Energized by our better and bolder strategic 
framework, I’m confident we will help deliver a greener, healthier and more equitable world for us all.”

Carol B. Tomé, Chief Executive Officer, UPS

“At UPS, we know determined people working together 

can accomplish anything. That determination, instilled 

by our founder Jim Casey, is what motivates UPSers to 

solve the challenges brought on by climate change. We 

made good progress in 2022 but have more work to do 

when it comes to delinking carbon emissions from our 

growth and reducing our air emissions. Going forward, 

we will continue to use our scale and people, alongside 

our customers, suppliers and public-private partners, to 

deliver real change.”

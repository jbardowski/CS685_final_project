The Coca-Cola Company’s  
purpose is to refresh the world and 
make a difference. 

We have remained true to that purpose for 137 years,  
and I am as encouraged today about the future of our  
business as I have ever been. 

Our strategy is clear. It’s centered around people— 
our consumers and employees—and driving sustainable 
solutions that build resilience into our business to respond  
to current and future challenges, while creating positive  
change for the planet.

GREAT BRANDS, BOLD EXPERIMENTATION

As a total beverage company, we are committed to offering 
people more of the drinks they want across a range of 
categories and in a variety of sizes. In 2022, we launched  
246 low- or no-sugar beverages and continued to see double-
digit growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which is now available  
in more than 170 markets. This helped to drive our volume of 
low- and no-calorie beverage sales to 29% of total volume. 

We’re driving the most significant marketing transformation 
in our history, focused on digital-first engagement with 
consumers. We’re combining partnerships, technology and our 
consumers’ passions to create unforgettable experiences in 
music, gaming and sports, including:

•  Coca-ColaCreations: This global innovation platform lends 
the iconic Coca-Cola brand to new expressions, driven by 
collaboration, creativity and cultural connection. Launched 
in 2022, we introduced five limited-edition drinks that drew 
inspiration from music, gaming and culture. These were 
complemented with experimental packaging designs and 
various digital experiences.

•   SpriteLimelight: A music and cultural extension of the 

brand’s global platform “Heat Happens,” Sprite Limelight 
aims to unite fans from different cultures and lifestyles by 
bringing together different artists from around the world.

We’re also experimenting with new drinks. We’ve launched 
Jack Daniel’s & Coca-Cola as a ready-to-drink cocktail through 
a relationship with Brown-Forman. This is one example of 
our ongoing journey to bring Coke to consumers in new and 
dynamic ways. We take the new responsibilities that come 
with our entry in this space very seriously. As a result, we’ve 
embedded our Global Policy on Alcohol Responsibility into our 
business processes to ensure we grow our alcohol brands in a 
responsible and sustainable way.

SUSTAINABILITY IS CORE TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY

Water: Water is a priority for our company because it is the 
first ingredient in all our beverages and is essential to the 
communities we serve. As a local business operating in more 
than 200 countries and territories, we have a responsibility to 
help protect critical resources. 

Our 2030 Water Security Strategy focuses on increasing 
water security. We work with partners to provide access to a 
steady supply of clean water for people and ecosystems in the 
areas where we operate and source ingredients. We recently 
announced a more focused effort to prioritize the most water-
stressed regions. As we’ve done since 2015, we’ll continue to 
replenish the water we use in our finished beverages to nature 
and communities. In 2022, we replenished 159%.

Our strategy is clear.  
It’s centered around 
people—our consumers 
and employees—and 
driving sustainable 
solutions that build 
resilience into our 
business to respond 
to current and future 
challenges, while creating 
positive change for  
the planet.”

Packaging: We seek to drive a circular economy for our 
packaging because this helps to reduce waste and carbon 
emissions. We’re working to use more recycled content in 
our packaging, to expand our use of refillable bottles, and to 
collect packaging for recycling through our World Without 
Waste initiative. We also partner to design new solutions for 
packaging. For example, we licensed our technology for a 100% 
plant-based plastic bottle to a company building a commercial-
scale facility in Germany. This bio-based plastic packaging  
has a lower carbon footprint than other plastics. While we’re 
making progress, we know there is more work to be done.  
In 2022, we collected 61% of the equivalent bottles and cans 
that we introduced into the market and used 15% rPET  
in our bottles.

To galvanize collective action, we invest in solutions and 
partnerships across industry, governments and society.  
In 2022, we became a Strategic Partner of the Ellen MacArthur 
Foundation. This group includes companies within key industry 
sectors that can help drive the transition to a circular economy.

Climate: Our water, packaging and climate goals are 
interconnected. For example, by creating a circular economy  
for packaging, we can lower our carbon footprint.  
By approaching water stewardship from a basin perspective, 
we participate in initiatives that increase communities’ 
resilience to extreme weather events, alongside our partners. 
Our approach to climate is rooted in science, and we’ve  
set a science-based target to reduce absolute greenhouse  
gas emissions by 25% by 2030, against a 2015 baseline.  
As of 2022, we have reduced our emissions by 7% against  
this baseline.

A COMPANY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS

We’re committed to creating a culture of inclusion and 
belonging and to driving meaningful change in our 
communities. By 2030, we aspire to be 50% led by women 
globally. Today, 39% of our senior leaders are women. 

The Coca-Cola Foundation, the philanthropic arm of  
The Coca-Cola Company, contributed $94.8 million to 301 
organizations around the world in 2022 to help create a better 
shared future for the communities our business serves.

Our continued success would not be possible without our 
people. I am grateful for the company and system employees 
who live our purpose every day. Their collective passion  
and focus to build loved brands and make a difference in  
the world is how our business will continue to thrive for 
generations to come.

WATER LEADERSHIP

Water is a priority for The Coca-Cola Company because it is 

essential to life, our beverages and the communities we serve. 

We have operations nearly everywhere in the world—in more than 

200 countries and territories. That means we have a responsibility 

to help those who face water scarcity and to protect local water 

resources where we operate, especially in places with the 

biggest challenges. 

Our 2030 Water Security Strategy is focused on accelerating  

the actions needed to increase water security where we 

operate, source ingredients and touch people’s lives. We do that 

by contributing toward sustainable, clean water access that 

improves livelihoods and wellbeing while protecting against 

water-related disasters. We understand water challenges are 

different in each region, so we are focused on doing what matters 

most locally, where the challenges are greatest.

Wehavesetthreekeygoalsdesignedtoachieveourvision:

•   Achieve 100% regenerative water use across 175ofourfacilities,

and verified data. The replenish benefit is typically estimated as a long-term, average annual volume, but for some project activities it varies annually. Replenish benefits fall 
under three categories: Watershed Protection and Restoration (233.5 BL), Water for Productive Use (40.9 BL) and Water Access and Sanitation (17.4 BL). Due to joint venture 
or merger and acquisition activities between 2019–2022, certain brands may not be accounted for in this metric. Unless otherwise stated, in this report finished beverages is 
based on global sales volume. Approximately 13.5 BL (approx. 7%) of the water used in our beverages that we returned to nature and communities is from 7 projects located in 
Ukraine and Belarus where since May 2019 we have not been able to monitor projects on intervals aligned with internal guidelines due to COVID and the ongoing war.

HUMAN RIGHTS

Our products and some of our packaging are made from a 

2022 Progress on Sustainable Sourcing2

Respecting human rights is one of our core values.  

wide variety of agricultural ingredients, which we source from 

around the world. This complex global supply chain includes 

many kinds of suppliers, from multinational companies to 

smallholder farmers. Our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture 

(PSA) communicate our expectations for environmental, social 

and economic performance to our agricultural suppliers at 

the farm level. The PSA, introduced in 2021, take a long-term 

perspective and reflect the most recent science, our total 
beverage company portfolio, and our increasingly diverse 

supply chain. The PSA are designed to encourage continuous 

improvement in farming practices and lead to more ethical and 

sustainable sourcing.

Our goal is to sustainably source all our ingredients over 

time—such as sugar cane, corn, fruit, coffee, tea and soybeans. 

Sustainably sourcing our ingredients increases the resilience 

of our supply chain, helps to conserve nature, and empowers 

producers and farm workers. In practice, we encourage 

and support our ingredient suppliers to drive continuous 

improvement in sustainable farming practices, based  

on our PSA.

The Coca-Cola Company markets, 
manufactures and sells:

•  Beverage concentrates and syrups

•    Finished beverages (including sparkling soft 

drinks; water, sports, coffee & tea; juice, value-

added dairy & plant-based beverages; and 

emerging beverages).

In our concentrate operations, The Coca-Cola 

Company typically generates net operating 

revenues by selling concentrates and syrups  

to authorized bottling partners.

Our bottling partners combine the concentrates 

and syrups with still or sparkling water  

and sweeteners (depending on the product),  

to prepare, package, distribute and sell  

finished beverages.

Our finished product operations consist  

primarily of company-owned bottling and 

distribution operations.

We also operate retail outlets through  

Costa Limited (Costa), which has nearly 4,000 

Costa coffee shops and over 14,000 Costa 

Express self-serve coffee bars worldwide. Costa’s 

portfolio also includes ready-to-drink and at-

home coffee solutions.

NEW EXPERIENCES
We’re taking global innovation 
to the next level. In 2022, we 
combined partnerships, technology 
and our consumers’ passions to 
create unforgettable experiences in 
music, gaming and sports.

CostaCoffeeSmartCafé

Launched in the United States in 

2022, the Costa Coffee Smart Café 

delivers a range of more than 200 

drink options, from espresso to 

hot chocolate. These innovative 

touch-screen machines always 

use fresh milk and freshly ground 

Signature Blend beans.

CokeStudio

Coke Studio expanded into a global, digital-first platform. 

Seven diverse artists from seven countries teamed up 

on a remake of Queen’s “A Kind of Magic” to kick off 

the platform. Coke Studio launched in 2008 in Pakistan 

as a TV series featuring live collaborations between 

established and emerging musical artists before growing 

into an international music franchise with editions in 

India, the Philippines, Africa and the Middle East.

Coca-ColaCreations

Coca-Cola Creations is a new global innovation platform 

that lends the iconic Coca-Cola brand to new expressions, 

driven by collaboration, creativity and cultural connection. 

In 2022, we launched five limited-edition drinks:  

Coca-Cola Starlight, Coca-Cola Byte, the artist 

Marshmello’s Limited Edition Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola 

Dreamworld, and Coca-Cola Soul Blast. Coca-Cola 

Creations draws inspiration from music, gaming and 

culture, and is complemented with experimental 

packaging designs, digital experiences and more.

“RecycledRecords”

Legendary music producers Mark Ronson and 

Madlib teamed up with Sprite, Fresca and 

Seagram’s to showcase the parallels between 

recycling sounds and beverage bottles. “Recycled 

Records” is an original EP created almost entirely 

from “recycled” sound samples captured during 

the PET bottle-to-bottle recycling process. The 

project is a creative, culturally relevant way 

to celebrate the brands’ switch from green to 

clear PET packaging.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT & PARTNERSHIPS

AMetaverseMilestone

Coca-Cola thanked fans who participated in the 

brand’s journey into the metaverse with a special 

digital collectible drop on International Friendship 

Day 2022. The collectible, featuring a design 

inspired by the bubbles inside a Coke bottle as well 

as themes of connection and unity, airdropped to 

the digital wallets of Coca-Cola collectible owners in 

July. Recipients could share a second International 
Friendship Day collectible with a friend to build 

Coke’s community of fans.

LilNasXandvitaminwater

Global superstar Lil Nas X teamed up 

with vitaminwater’s “Nourish Every 

You” campaign to showcase six videos 

featuring his unreleased track, “Give Me 

One Chance.” Each featured a unique 

vitaminwater flavor—focus, shine, energy, 

xxx zero, gutsy and ice—to create a fantasy 

world inspiring fans to nourish all of their 

“yous.” “Nourish Every You” was inspired 

by the insight that vitaminwater fans 

want to take care of themselves, but are 

living with fluctuating physical, emotional 

and spiritual needs.

SpriteLimelight

Sprite Limelight launched as the 

music and cultural extension of “Heat 
Happens,” the brand’s global platform 

unveiled in 2022. Grammy-winning 

producer James Blake crafted a 

lyrical hook rooted in keeping life’s 

“heat” at bay, and three distinctive 

global artists—American rapper Coi 

Leray, African singer-songwriter and 

social media sensation Omah Lay, 

and Chinese pop/rock singer Hua 

Chenyu—used the hook as inspiration 

for their own original songs.

POWERADE: 
‘PauseisPower’

POWERADE celebrated the 
power of the pause—prioritizing 

wellbeing over winning—with a 

global communications platform 

featuring USA gymnast Simone 

Biles and other accomplished 

athletes and coaches spanning a 

variety of sports. The campaign 

kicked off in March 2022 

during NCAA March Madness.

in the company’s proxy statements and makes 

recommendations to the Board. In addition, 

the Committee receives updates on priority 

sustainability issues, including actions and

Beginning in 2022, performance 

as it relates to diversity, packaging 

and water goals is reflected in our 

incentive programs for executives.

To reinforce the importance of meeting our sustainability goals, 

the Talent and Compensation Committee approved plans to link 

sustainability performance to our annual and long-term incentive 

programs for executives in 2022. In the annual incentive program, 

we have reinforced our commitment to DEI by incorporating 

quantitative and qualitative components tied to our 2030 

aspirations to be 50% led by women globally and, in the United 

States, to align race and ethnicity representation to U.S. census 

data. Similarly, in the long-term incentive program, predefined 

goals related to our World Without Waste packaging strategy 

and our 2030 Water Security Strategy were incorporated into the 

2022–2024 incentive awards.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

The Coca-Cola Company works closely with 

approximately 200 bottling partners across 

more than 200 countries and territories to 

achieve our sustainability goals. We have 

established internal processes and an internal 

control environment that help us identify and 

manage risks. One hallmark of our approach is 

regular communication between the Board, our 

Chairman and CEO, and internal teams such 

as the Enterprise Risk Management team, the 

Risk Steering Committee and the Networked 

Corporate Sustainability team, which includes 

Technical, Innovation and Supply Chain; Public 

Affairs, Communications and Sustainability;  

Global Human Rights; and Procurement. The 

company’s Compliance, Legal and Finance 

functions serve in an advisory role. Our networked 

teams also collaborate with operating units, 

bottling partners, NGOs, governments, investors 

and people in communities all around the world  

to identify risks and make progress toward  

our sustainability goals. For more about our 

approach to risk management and priority  

issues, see Priority Topics.

Prior to 2022, our last comprehensive review 

was conducted in 2019, with refreshes being 

undertaken in 2020 and 2021 to establish closer 

alignment between priority topics and business-

relevant issues and practices.

Our 2022 review included a robust analysis and 

broader engagement guided by ERM, a leading 

sustainability consultancy. This was followed 

by interviews with more than 30 internal and 

external stakeholders and an online survey that 

had 90 responses from across the globe.

Stakeholders we talked to represent a diversity 

of views and have deep expertise across a range 

of issues and sectors. The stakeholders included 

investors and financial institutions, NGOs, 

bottling partners, trade and industry associations, 

business peers, customers and suppliers. 

Our comprehensive 2022 review process resulted 

in an updated priority topics matrix, which 

reflects adjustments to several key issues in 

response to feedback from both internal and 

external stakeholders.

PARTNERING FOR IMPACT

As one of the world’s largest 
and most recognized companies, 
we have an opportunity to 
use our size and scale to help 
address global challenges. 

While we strive to make progress on our own,  

we are committed to fostering partnerships  

that drive collective impact in areas including 

water stewardship, packaging circularity, climate 

action and many more. As a global business  

that operates locally, we can extend our impact 

and reach because of the strength of the  

Coca-Cola system, which includes our 

approximately 200 bottling partners worldwide.

We engage with stakeholders, including 

governments, NGOs, communities, suppliers, 

investors, business partners, customers and 

consumers around the world and throughout  

our network, in many forums and formats. 

Feedback from our stakeholders allows us to 

learn and improve, and informs our business  

and sustainability strategy.

In all our engagements with stakeholders, 

we are committed to upholding the 
principles of transparency, consistency, 
accountability and integrity.

SECTIONSCOPE:  In this section our 
stakeholder engagement and partnership 

work refers to actions by the company 

as well as our owned and independent 

bottling partners and our independent 

suppliers and partners.

PartnershipHighlights

GlobalLeadershipEvents

•    Coca-Cola Philippines and Indorama Ventures 

partnered to establish PETValue Philippines, 

a full operation recycling facility that is the 

first of its kind in the country. The facility is 

helping to drive collective action toward a 

circular economy for PET plastic, by providing 

more than 800 collection points for PET 

bottles in the country. PETValue’s projected 

capacity, or the amount of used plastic bottles 

it can process, is 30,000 metric tons per year, 

which requires around 2 billion PET bottles as 

input to be recycled.

•    In partnership with WWF-Pakistan, we are 

working to address water scarcity and quality 

issues for approximately 360,000 people in 

Lahore, Pakistan who rely on the Ravi River as 

a freshwater source. 

•     We partnered with the CEO Water Mandate, 

denkstatt and others to help build the 

business case for Nature-Based Solutions 

(NBS) by developing a standardized 

methodology to quantify the co-benefits 

of NBS projects and calculate the social 

return on investment. 

•     We joined the Supplier Leadership on  

Climate Transition initiative along with  

18 other companies to mobilize collective 
climate action by providing suppliers with 

resources, tools and knowledge to accelerate 

their decarbonization. Ten suppliers that we 

sponsored, who completed the program, 

have set or committed to setting emissions 

reduction targets through the Science-Based 

Targets initiative. 

•     We joined with the Business Coalition for a 

Global Plastics Treaty and the International 

Council of Beverages Associations in support 

of a UN Global Plastics Treaty. The Business 

Coalition is supporting the treaty negotiations 

around the vision of a circular economy 

in which plastic never becomes waste or 

pollution, and the value of products and 

materials is retained in the economy.

In 2022, as COVID-19 restrictions eased, we were able to attend several 
global events in person. We used these opportunities to engage with diverse 
stakeholders, to listen and to explore ways to drive collective action to 
positively impact people, communities and our environment.

Water  
Leadership

Water is a priority for The Coca-Cola Company 
because it is essential to life, our beverages and the 
communities we serve. It is also critical to public health, 
food security, biodiversity and the climate crisis. The 
world is experiencing increased water insecurity, which 
is evident through water scarcity, with demands for 
safe, usable water exceeding supply in certain areas. 

We have operations nearly everywhere in the world—
in more than 200 countries and territories. That 
means we have a responsibility to accelerate our 
efforts to help address water stress, protect local 
water resources and help build community climate 
resilience—communities’ ability to adapt to these 
changing conditions. That’s why our 2030 Water 
Security Strategy is focused on accelerating the 
actions needed to increase water security where we 
operate, source ingredients and touch people’s lives.1

1   The previously reported figure of 18.5 million people provided access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene since 2010, was through working collectively 

with The Coca-Cola Foundation, bottlers, implementing partners and other co-funders.

2   Substantially all replenish data is internally validated and verified; the equivalent volume for 100% Replenish rate (182.9 Billion litres BL) is externally assured. Peer-
reviewed methodologies were used to calculate volumetric benefits per project and operating unit for all externally assured data; one exception was approved for 
internally validated and verified data. The replenish benefit is typically estimated as a long-term, average annual volume, but for some project activities it varies 
annually. Replenish benefits fall under three categories: Watershed Protection and Restoration (233.5 BL), Water for Productive Use (40.9 BL) and Water Access and 
Sanitation (17.4 BL). Due to joint venture or merger and acquisition activities between 2019–2022, certain brands may not be accounted for in this metric. Unless 
otherwise stated, in this report finished beverages is based on global sales volume. Approximately 13.5 Billion liters (approx. 7%) of the water used in our beverages 
that we returned to nature and communities is from 7 projects located in Ukraine and Belarus where since May 2019 we have not been able to monitor projects on 
intervals aligned with internal guidelines due to COVID and the ongoing war.

2030 WATER SECURITY STRATEGY

Vision: Our 2030 Water 
Security Strategy is focused on 
accelerating the actions needed 
to increase water security where 
we operate, source ingredients 
and touch people’s lives. We 
do that by contributing toward 
sustainable, clean water access 
that improves livelihoods and 
wellbeing while protecting 
against water-related disasters. 
We also work to preserve 
nature and biodiversity as well 
to promote advanced water 
management practices.

PRIORITIZING OPERATIONS, COMMUNITIES AND WATERSHEDS

In 2022, we completed our analysis of water-

related risks in areas where we can make 
the greatest impact1. We prioritized our 
operating facilities, commercial regions, 

Watersheds
Similarly, we undertook a comprehensive process 

to identify priority watersheds across our system. 

These include our Leadership Locations and 

sourcing regions for global priority ingredients, 

their water sources, where we source global 

watersheds and communities. 

priority ingredients, key growth markets and 

priority communities. 

Operations
We analyzed water sourcing risks across 
approximately 700 operational locations (mainly 

Communities
We also began mapping priority communities, 

concentrate plants and bottling facilities) and 

based on their lack of access to water, sanitation 

mapped the minor river basins and sourcing 

and hygiene (WASH) and resilience to water-

basins of these facilities. We catalogued these 

related impacts of climate change (e.g., floods 

locations based on the detailed mapping 

and results from an Enterprise Water Risk 

and droughts), with a focus on communities 

close to our facilities, and/or in urban growth 

Assessment from the World Resources Institute’s 

centers where we sell our products, and/

Aqueduct 3.0 tool and from Facility Water 

Vulnerability Assessments—our site-level, 

internal proprietary tool.

or in rural farming communities where 

we source ingredients.

As a result, each facility has been placed within 

watersheds and communities, we have developed 

one of three categories: 

•  LEADERSHIPLOCATIONS: Approximately 

25% of our facilities face the highest level of 

water-related risks and are on a path to 100% 

regenerative water use by 2030. 

•   ADVANCEDEFFICIENCYLOCATIONS: System 
facility locations in a water-stressed context 
that will drive advanced water efficiency 

improvements in operations.

•   CONTRIBUTINGLOCATIONS: System facility 

locations in areas with low water-related risks. 

These will contribute to water security overall 

by implementing the Coca-Cola system's 

Water Resource Sustainability Standard, 

achieving industry benchmark water efficiency 

and 100% compliance with wastewater 

discharge standards.

a framework of prioritization and a deeper 

understanding of risks, which will help us 

develop holistic, integrated and context-based 

approaches to help increase water security 

where it matters the most in our business, 

operations and supply chains.

DefiningRegenerativeWaterUse

Regenerative water use means facilities 

must reduce, reuse, recycle and replenish 

the water used in operations in the local 

correlated watersheds for beneficial social, 

economic and/or environmental uses by 

other stakeholders and nature.

By mapping and overlaying our priority facilities, 

market growth regions. 

MakingtheGreatestImpactWhereItMattersMostbyDoingWhatMattersMost

Prioritizing operations, watersheds and 
communities in Türkiye

In Türkiye, we identified an operating facility located in a water-

stressed area as a priority facility (Leadership Location) in the city 

of Bursa in the north-west of the country. The facility is owned and 

operated by our bottling partner Coca-Cola İçecek. Further, we 

identified the Bursa/Balikesir watershed as a priority because it 

not only serves as a water source for our facility but also because 

it supports the growing of apples, peaches and nectarines 

that we source as ingredients in our products. In addition, we 

identified seven farming villages in the same province as priority 

communities, based on their location in ingredient sourcing and key 

The watershed faces high levels of water scarcity and pollution 

of water sources from local industries, including textiles and 

agriculture (e.g., use of insecticides). Rural farming communities 

TÜRKIYE

have relatively low levels of access to clean water.

The operating facility is driving water efficiency improvements  

by conducting a gap assessment against the Coca-Cola system’s 

Water Resource Sustainability Standard compliance process 

and working with a third-party consultancy to screen options 

for improving water efficiency in our operations. We developed a

In this way we are working to help improve water security by 

focusing on actions we can take both within and outside our 

operations to help improve water efficiency and watershed 

health as well as support local communities and farmers through

REDUCING WATER CHALLENGES IN OUR OPERATIONS

All our production operations  
will continue to implement 
the Coca-Cola system’s Water 
Resource Sustainability Standard. 

operational costs associated with water use. 

Better understanding of these costs will help 

strengthen decision making and the business 

case for investment in initiatives that respond 

to local challenges.  

The purpose of this standard is to identify and 

reduce water quality- and quantity-related 

challenges for our operations.

To decrease water use in our operations, we 

use internal tools such as the Water Efficiency 

Catalogue, which assesses technical standards 

(e.g., on-line flow monitoring, water collection 

and reuse capabilities) and team culture (e.g., 

training and communication on the importance of 

water efficiency) regarding water efficiency in our 

production facilities and provides innovative best 

practices (e.g., water reuse for package rinsing 

and water-free lubrication of conveyor belts). 

In the development of new plants, we leverage 

our Sustainability by Design Tool to ensure that 

water-efficient processes are implemented and 

that we achieve best-in-class water efficiency.

We have set an ambitious target to reduce our 

water use ratio by 20% by 2030 from a 2015 

baseline for all operations across the system.  

We are focused on water efficiency improvements 

in Leadership Locations and Advanced Efficiency 

Locations that operate in water-stressed contexts, 

which has resulted in a water use ratio of 1.79 

liters of water used per liter of beverage in 

2022. This is our highest achievement in water 

efficiency to date and significantly better than the 

industry average for carbonated soft drinks of 
1.91 l/l of beverages.1

CostofWater
We have partnered with denkstatt to develop 

a “Cost of Water” tool for our teams. This tool 

will help us get a better understanding of the 

cost of water by evaluating the costs associated 

with potential water risks in addition to the

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

In 2022, we also worked with Bluerisk and 

Valuing Impact and a number of peer companies 

to better understand how projects returning 
water to communities and nature help create 

societal value. Across the 22 projects analyzed, 

we learned that these projects not only generated 

210 million cubic meters of volumetric water 

benefits, but also delivered $39 million in 

societal value, with an average societal return on 

investment (SROI) of 3.9. 

We have a goal to achieve 100% regenerative 

water use in all our 175 Leadership Locations 

globally by 2030. In 2022, we included progress 

against water replenishment in Leadership 

Locations as a metric for the Long-Term Incentive 

(LTI) plan for our executive leadership team. Over 

the past year, our Talent and Compensation 

Committee approved the inclusion of a metric 

related to water replenishment in Leadership 

Locations in line with the goals of our 2030 

Water Security Strategy. 

Wehavecontinuedtoimprovethe

10% IMPROVEMENT in water efficiency 

across all system operations compared  

to 2015.

In 2022, The Coca-Cola Foundation 

provided support to Ceres for the 

Valuing Water Finance Initiative to drive 

investor leadership on valuing water 

and to broaden investors’ perspective 

on the role that water plays in many 

industries’ value chains.

WaterStewardshipin
ConcentratePlants

Within our 18 concentrate production 

plants, which produce the concentrates 

used to make many of our sparkling 

beverages, the company has committed 

to driving water efficiency improvements. 

In 2022, we achieved a 7% average water 

efficiency improvement across all our 

concentrate plants compared to a 2015 

baseline. These facilities have worked 

as a network to review and assess the 

implementation of best practices and 

governance of water use, known as 

“Water Efficiency Maturity Assessments.”

As an example, in 2022, one of our 

concentrate plants in Ireland reduced its 

water consumption by more than 13,000 

cubic meters compared to the previous 

year by implementing circular washing in  

its clean-in-place process. A monitor-to-

improve mindset in our local team  

is also key to achieving and sustaining 

this level of performance.

As a member of the Alliance for Water 

Stewardship (AWS), we are proud to be 
a part of a global movement to advance 

good water stewardship practices. The 

AWS certification confirms that the 

highest global standard for responsible 

water stewardship has been met in 

support of social, cultural, environmental 

and economic benefits at both the site 

and catchment level. We plan to certify 

all our 18 concentrate production sites 

against the latest AWS Standard by 2025.

IMPROVING WATERSHED HEALTH

WatershedStewardshipPlans

MEXICO 

In Chihuahua, Mexico, we partnered with The Nature Conservancy, a global environmental 

nonprofit organization, to develop a watershed stewardship plan for the Lago Bustillo y de los 

Mexicanos watershed. It was identified as a priority watershed because it supplies water to  

a manufacturing facility owned by our bottling partner Corporación del Fuerte, which is  

a Leadership Location. In addition, the watershed includes orchards from which the system 

sources apples. The agricultural sector and the city of Cuauhtémoc are major water users.  

The watershed is forecasted to face increasing water quality and quantity challenges in the 

coming years due to population growth and rising temperatures. With funding from Fundación 

Coca-Cola Mexico, our projects in this watershed have helped to improve rural communities’ 

access to water, mainly through rainwater harvesting systems and check dams. The watershed 

stewardship plan completed in 2022 helped identify key context-specific interventions to 

consider for future projects including, reforestation, rainwater harvesting, dams, plant nurseries, 

conservation of springs and community access to WASH, as well as the need to strengthen local 

partnerships. These plans will also help us to track improvements in watershed health and co-

benefits of projects (e.g., enhanced biodiversity and carbon sequestration). One project currently 

in the pipeline is working with an agri-tech partner, Kilimo, to help local farmers save water by 

adopting technology-enabled irrigation management tools.

Developing watershed stewardship plans 

at the catchment-scale is critical to helping 

water users in a particular region identify and 

address the drivers of water risk. Working 

with partners to implement solutions, 

stakeholders can take an effective science-

based approach to improve water resilience 

for both people and nature.”

IMPROVING WATERSHED HEALTH (continued)

Protecting watersheds and recognizing the 

unique challenges and characteristics of water 

sources around the world has long been 

a focus of our work. 

Watersheds supply water for drinking, agriculture 

and manufacturing; provide habitat for plants and 

animals; and offer opportunities for recreation. 

Based on our 2030 Water Security Strategy, we 

are placing even greater emphasis on the holistic 

improvement of watershed health. We set a goal 

to improve watershed health in 60 watersheds 

identified as most critical for our operations and 

agricultural supply chain by 2030.

OUR AGRICULTURAL WATER FOOTPRINT

Producing the ingredients used in our beverages 

accounts for an estimated 92% of our total blue 
water1 footprint, which is the volume of surface 
water and groundwater consumed in producing 

our finished products (evaporated or embedded 

in the product). That’s why, in 2022, we expanded 

our analysis and prioritization to include 

watersheds that support our priority ingredient 

sourcing, in addition to our operating facilities and 

those necessary for key market growth.

WaterQuality
We’re working with several partners, 

including the World Resources Institute 

(WRI) and The Nature Conservancy, to 

develop a Water Quality Benefit Accounting 

(WQBA) methodology that seeks to provide 

guidance on identifying shared water 

quality challenges, activity selection, and 

recommended water quality indicators and 

benefit calculation methods.

BUILDING COMMUNITIES’ WATER RESILIENCE  

We adopt a human-rights 
based approach to water and 
communities. 

We recognize the connection between our 

social license to operate and functional, resilient 

water infrastructure. Insufficient access to water, 

sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure 

and poor water quality are key challenges 
faced by communities around the world. These 

challenges are being exacerbated by population 

growth, climate change, political conflict 

and forced migration. 

For more than a decade, The Coca-Cola Company 

has established strong leadership in community 

water programs with the support of The Coca-Cola 

Foundation and many nonprofits, governments, 

customers and other partners.

We are updating our reporting methodology 

for our community water programming data to 

align with our 2030 Water Security Strategy and 

upcoming external frameworks, and we will apply  

it to future data reporting when ready.

In 2022, our operating units began the 

identification of priority communities based 

on communities’ access to WASH and/or their 

resilience to the impacts of climate change (e.g., 

floods and droughts). We aim to support our 

priority communities in addressing shared water 

challenges by identifying and implementing 

interventions focused on:

1.    Improving access to safe drinking water, 

sanitation and hygiene.

2.   Enabling adaptation to water-related 

climate change impacts.

3.  Ensuring rapid recovery from crises.

TheCo-BenefitsofWASHAccess
We’re working with WASH4Work, an initiative 

hosted by the CEO Water Mandate, to develop 

a standardized methodology of accounting for 

the co-benefits of WASH projects (e.g., health, 

income, nutrition, safety and security, and 

education) and strengthen the business case for 

investments in WASH programs.

INTEGRATING GENDER INTO WASH PROGRAMS 

Gender has always been a core focus for our 

WASH programs because we know that women 

and girls suffer disproportionately from poor 

access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene. 

In 2018, The Coca-Cola Foundation partnered 

with Global Water Challenge (GWC), USAID and 

Ipsos through the Water and Development 
Alliance (WADA) on a study across three countries 

in Africa—Nigeria, Rwanda, and Eswatini—of 

the impact of improved WASH on women’s

In Latin America and the Caribbean, 25% of the population lack access to safely managed drinking 
water services.1 Climate change, urbanization, accelerated water usage, and inadequate infrastructure 
are among the leading causes. In response to this, Coca-Cola Latin America, in alliance with the 

Global Environment Technology Foundation (GETF) and local civil society organizations, designed and 

launched a platform called Aliados por el Agua (Aliados) to help improve access to water, sanitation 

and hygiene (WASH) for 2 million people across 18 countries by 2030.

In 2022, Aliados implemented more than 30 projects across 12 countries, in partnership with  

26 civil society organizations, as well as local municipalities, utility providers and communities, and 

empowerment. This “Ripple Effect” study found

SPOTLIGHT: INVESTING IN NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS

Recognizing that nature 
itself often offers the best 
mechanisms for restoring 
watershed health, the company, 
The Coca-Cola Foundation and 
our bottling partners invest in 
nature-based solutions (NBS), 
such as forest protection and 
floodplain management, which 
build on natural processes to 
manage water systems. 

Through our work, we have learned that NBS 

projects often have multiple co-benefits, such 

as better water quality, carbon sequestration, 

increased climate resilience, and enhanced 

richness and variety of life of natural 

habitats (biodiversity).

We worked with denkstatt to develop a 

methodology to help us quantify and test the co-

benefits of NBS projects. In 2022, we partnered 

with the CEO Water Mandate, denkstatt and 

others to help build the business case for NBS 

by developing a standardized methodology to 

measure benefit accrual and a means to value 

social return on investment. The methodology 

has been tested across several of our water 

replenishment projects in key geographies. 

This valuation methodology supports the broader 

Benefit Accounting of Nature-Based Solutions for 

Watersheds project, including The NBS Benefits 

Explorer tool, led by the Pacific Institute and 

CEO Water Mandate, in partnership with The 

Nature Conservancy and LimnoTech. Our aim is 

to support public, private and non-profit sectors 

in developing effective policies and programs 

to incentivize greater implementation of and 

investment in NBS because water is at the nexus 

of many goals, including protecting habitats, 

increasing biodiversity, sequestering carbon and 

promoting community resilience in the face of 

changing weather patterns.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

In order to achieve large-scale impact 

globally, we partner with governments, 

NGOs, communities and other companies.

We encourage others to join us.”

ReforestationHelpsRestoreWatershedHealth 
inthePhilippines

The Ipo Watershed in Bulacan in the Philippines supplies water to 

Metro Manila, the second most populous region of the country. Forest 

cover within the watershed has dramatically dropped from 85% to 
just 40% in recent years1 due to illegal logging and unsustainable 
forest practices, which has resulted in a reduction in the natural 

water storage capacity of the basin. Malnutrition is also a pervasive 

challenge in local communities. Since 2016, The Coca-Cola Foundation 

and Coca-Cola Foundation Philippines have worked in partnership 

with WWF-Philippines to protect rainforests of the area, replant trees 

and provide livelihood opportunities. The project has reforested 165 

hectares of degraded land in the watershed and supported local 

communities to start household gardens to grow food.

In 2022 the project was assessed using the NBS valuation 

methodology. Overall, the project provided a very positive return on 

social investment and its specific co-benefits included:

•   WATERQUANTITY: The replenishment of approximately 400 million 
liters of water per year due to decreased runoff and improved water 

access for local communities. 

•   CARBONSEQUESTRATION: Approximately 2,500 metric tons  

of CO2e per year from reforestation.

• 

 FOODSUPPLY: Household gardens helped to tackle food 
insecurity and some of the trees planted have edible fruits 
(e.g., rambutan, coffee).

We support more than 50 calorie and sugar 

reduction pledges globally, in collaboration with 

industry peers. In 2022, we joined an updated 

industry-wide pledge in Australia to reduce the 

sugar content in our portfolio by 25% by 2025. 

In Kazakhstan, we are among nine members 

of the national beverage association to sign an 

industry pledge to reduce average added sugar 

in our drinks by 10% by the end of 2026. And 
we support guidelines released by the Health 

Ministry of Türkiye and Federation of Food and 

Drink Industry Associations of Türkiye to reduce 

sugar in nonalcoholic beverages and certain food 

categories by 10% by 2025.

In Europe, we are leading the soft drinks industry 

in voluntarily committing to sugar reduction. 

Together with peers through the industry 

association UNESDA Soft Drinks Europe, we have 

reduced average added sugars in soft drinks by 

28.6% across the European Union and United 

Kingdom since 2000. In June 2021, as part of 

the EU Code of Conduct for Responsible Food 

Business and Marketing Practices, we joined a 

UNESDA Soft Drinks Europe pledge to reduce 

the sugar in our drinks by an additional 10% by 

2025, which will represent a 33% average sugar 

reduction when completed by 2025 compared to 

2000. The European soft drinks sector is the only 

sector to have made an additional sugar reduction 

commitment under the EU Code of Conduct.

We support the recommendations 
of leading health authorities that 
individuals should consume less 
than 10% of their total calories 
from added sugar. That’s why, 
from 2017–2022, we removed 
more than 900,000 tons of 
added sugar from our global 
portfolio through more than 1,000 
beverage reformulations. 

EUROPE
By 2025, we aim for 50% of the 
drinks we sell in Europe to be 
low- and no-calorie drinks (we’re 
currently at 45%) in support of the 
EU Commission’s Farm-to-Fork 
strategy to accelerate the transition 
to sustainable food systems.

SMALLER PACKAGING

People can enjoy our drinks in sizes that help 

control portions and added sugar intake. These 

include 7.5-oz. mini cans and 8-oz. glass bottles in 

many markets. We continue to expand availability 

of these packages and introduce newer offerings, 

including 150-ml mini cans and 250-ml slim cans, 
so people can enjoy the same great tastes in sizes 

that are right for them. 

In 2022, we kicked off a pilot of a Coca-Cola 

Freestyle compact fountain dispenser at on-the-

Britain and the Netherlands. In addition to giving 

consumers an expanded array of personalized, 

on-demand beverage choices—including low- and

RESPONSIBLE MARKETING 

We respect the role of parents and caregivers 

as the primary decision-makers for what their 

children drink, and we do not market any of our 

products directly to children under 13, regardless 

of nutritional profile. Effective January 1, 2022, we 

raised the age threshold from under 12 to under 
13 and reduced the audience threshold from 

35% to 30%. This means we will not place our 

marketing or advertising in any media, platform 

or event where more than 30% of the audience 

is under 13. Our policy goes beyond media and 

includes packaging, in-store and point of sale. 

Our approach is consistent with the International 

Chamber of Commerce Marketing & Advertising 

Code and its Framework for Responsible Food 

and Beverage Marketing Communication. 

We hold everyone involved in our marketing  

and communications accountable to our  

Global Responsible Marketing Policy, from 

employees and bottling partners to agency and 

media partners. We are a founding member of 

the International Food & Beverage Alliance (IFBA),

We are committed to providing transparent 

nutrition information about all of our products, 

in line with local regulations, so consumers can 

make informed decisions. We were the first 

beverage company to place calorie information on 

the front of nearly all our packaging worldwide. 

Today, we provide nutrition information on 

product labels, with the exception of certain 

returnable bottles, fountain beverages 

and waters (unsweetened, unflavored). For 

these beverage and packaging types, we 

offer nutrition information through websites 

and consumer hotlines.

WORKING TOWARD A WORLD WITHOUT WASTE
We recognize our responsibility to help solve complex 
plastic waste challenges facing our planet and society. 
That’s why, in 2018, we launched an ambitious strategy 
called World Without Waste to drive systemic change 
through a circular economy for our packaging. 

World Without Waste is a global sustainable 
packaging platform focused on measurable and 
interconnected goals, each of which are supported 
by additional targets:

•    Making 100% of our packaging recyclable globally 

by 2025—and using at least 50% recycled material in 
our packaging by 2030 (DESIGN); 

•    Collecting and recycling a bottle or can for each one 

we sell by 2030 (COLLECT); 

•    Bringing people together to support a healthy, 

debris-free environment (PARTNER).

SECTIONSCOPE: In this section, 
our packaging strategy refers to 

actions by the company as well as 

our owned and independent bottling 

partners and our independent 

suppliers and partners.

FRAMEWORKS

We are making progress against 
each of our objectives, which are 
embedded in how we operate as 
a business, and we are taking a 
transparent approach to reporting 
our actions, results and learnings. 

Local teams are executing in ways appropriate 

for their markets, and we are using a networked 

approach to deliver impact at scale. Our work has 

also shown us where the major challenges are, 
and some of our markets will have challenges 

meeting goals as quickly as others.

Because packaging accounts for approximately 

30% of our carbon footprint, nearly all of our 

World Without Waste efforts align with our 

2030 science-based climate target and net zero 

ambition. When we lightweight our packaging, 

incorporate more recycled and bio-based 

material, invest in local recycling programs and 

increase our use of reusable packaging, we 

can reduce both waste and our greenhouse 

gas (GHG) emissions.

REFILLABLE PACKAGING 

Reusable packaging can reduce single-use

options helps ensure high levels of collection 

of beverage containers. In 2022, we were 

proud to announce an industry-leading goal 

to have at least 25% of our beverage volume 

campaign kicked off on World Environment Day 

2022, inviting consumers to trade any recyclable 

PET bottle for a refillable bottle of Coca-Cola 
Zero Sugar. In Brazil, returnable, refillable PET 
bottles of Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite can be 

returned, cleaned and refilled up to 25 times.

OurPackaging 
Portfolio

We deliver our beverages in a variety  

of packaging formats—from glass and  

PET bottles, to aluminum cans, to 

refillable packaging. Just as we offer 

drink choices for a range of occasions, 

our packaging portfolio gives consumers 

multiple ways to enjoy our brands 

conveniently and safely. 

Since glass, aluminum and PET plastic are 

all recyclable materials, they all can play 

a role in a circular economy. Refillable 

packages, both glass and plastic, can 

have the lowest carbon footprints of our 

packaging options. PET packages with 

recycled content can have a lower carbon 

footprint than aluminum and glass, which 

require more energy to produce, recycle 

and transport.

•   In Scotland, Costa Limited (“Costa”) carried out 
a 14-store pilot of an on-the-go reusable cup 

scheme, which invited consumers to rent a cup 

by scanning a QR code before enjoying their 

drink and then returning the cup for it to be 

washed and reused. The effort supports Costa’s 

global goal for 25% of its drinks to be served in 

reusable or refillable packaging by 2030.

We tailor our refillable packaging approach by 

market, based on local conditions. In 2023, we 

launched an end-to-end refillables operations 

guide to help local teams implement more 
effective strategies and plans.

VIRGIN PET REDUCTION 

In 2021, we set a goal to reduce our use of virgin 

plastic derived from nonrenewable sources by 

avoiding a cumulative 3 million metric tons by 

2025 compared to 2020. We are pursuing this 

goal, which represents about 20% of our virgin 

plastic use, through more than 150 lightweighting 

projects and advancements on use of recycled 
and renewable materials.

beverages now include Bahrain, Bangladesh, 

Indonesia, Kuwait, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Saudi 

Arabia, South Korea, Thailand and Yemen.

virgin plastic overall.

MOVING TOWARD 100% rPET1

Around the world, many of our biggest brands are 

taking major steps to support a circular economy 

for plastic packaging. More than 40 markets 

currently offer at least one brand in 100% rPET 

packaging. A few highlights from 2022 include:

•   In the UnitedStatesandCanada, we recently 

began offering the majority of DASANI bottles— 

from 20-oz. and 1.5-liter singles to 10-oz. and 

12-oz. multipacks—in 100% rPET plastic. The shift 

Demand for recycled PET plastic for food-grade 

supports the DASANI brand's pledge to remove 

applications currently exceeds supply, so we need 

the equivalent of 2 billion virgin plastic bottles 

to help build a sustainable pipeline of high-quality 

from production by 2027 compared to 2021 

material. We work with communities to boost PET 

levels. The announcement followed the launch 

recycling and collection; collaborate with recycling 

of 100% rPET bottles in New York, California 

partners; and secure rPET to help ensure material 

and Texas, which also included Coca-Cola 20-

In recent years, system partners and suppliers 

have announced significant investments, both

awareness with “100% Recycled Bottle” and 

“Recycle Me Again” calls to action.

We continued to transition Sprite plastic bottles 

from green to clear PET to help increase the 

efficiency of recycling systems. The move, which 

the brand has completed or is in process in over 

100 countries, improves the efficiency of recycling 

systems and boosts availability of food-grade 

rPET. As one example, Coca-Cola North America’s 

entire green plastic portfolio—including packaging 

for Sprite, Fresca, Seagram’s and Mello Yello—

made the transition to clear PET in 2022.

As The Coca-Cola Company’s second-largest 

brand, Sprite is proud to demonstrate its 

commitment to circularity through our packaging 
by ensuring every bottle we make can be 

recycled and made into a new one. We can 

only achieve our World Without Waste goals by 

creating closed-loop packaging streams, and that 

starts with clear PET.”

2030 SCIENCE-BASED TARGET

We are working to reduce our 
carbon footprint in line with 
science to avoid the worst 
impacts of climate change. 

We do this by analyzing and prioritizing the 

sources of GHG emissions across our value chain 

and by partnering with stakeholders to drive 
down those emissions.

As of 2022, we reduced our emissions across 
Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 7%,1 making progress toward 
our science-based reduction target of 25% by 
2030 against a 2015 baseline1. Our ambition is 
to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Several 

of our bottling partners have announced 

their own science-based targets and net zero 

pledges to drive climate action across the 

global Coca-Cola system.

In 2022, our scope 1 emissions were 4.4 million 

metric tons, scope 2 emissions were 3.5 million 
metric tons2 and scope 3 emissions were 57.0 
million metric tons.

NetworksSupport 
OurNetZeroJourney

We are part of a number of business 

networks that are supporting our journey 

to net zero. As a member of the WWF 

Climate Business Network, we share best 

practices to drive collective ambition 

and scale action together. Participation 

in the Clean Energy Buyers Association 

(CEBA) allows us to help deploy market 

and policy solutions toward a carbon-free 

energy system. Membership in Ceres’ 

Company Network has helped to identify 

opportunities to drive further progress 

toward net zero emissions.

TakingActionAcrossOurValueChain

The involvement of our bottling partners and 

suppliers is essential to achieving our science-

based target to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 

3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030. The following 

are examples of how we are working on climate 

initiatives with partners across our value chain.

INCREASING RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY)  
IN MANUFACTURING

One critical strategy for reducing emissions in 

our system is the increased use of renewable 

energy in our manufacturing processes. 

Renewable electricity usage, which was third-

party assured for the first time in 2021, increased 

from 12% in 2021 to 21% in 2022. 

To build knowledge across our system and 

increase the generation, procurement and 

accurate reporting of renewable energy, we 

published a Renewable Energy Implementation 

Guidebook in March 2022. This guidebook 

provides a step-by-step process for associates 

across the system to implement on-site solar 

photovoltaic and solar hot water and steam 

systems, on-site and off-site renewable energy 

power purchase agreements (PPAs), coupled 

with energy attribute certificates to align with 

GHG Protocol Scope 2 quality criteria.

In addition to the guidebook, we launched a 

future-facing initiative called the Renewable 

Energy Project Pipeline in 2022, where we work 

closely with bottling partners to increase the 

number of renewable energy projects throughout 

our system. Approximately 20 bottling partners 

and 13 concentrate plants have developed  

2023–2025 renewable energy plans. As the 

number and scope of these projects expands, we 

will look for opportunities to collaborate  

and share best practices.

BOTTLING PARTNERS SET SCIENCE-BASED  
EMISSIONS TARGETS

Given the size of our network of bottling 

partners, they are critically important in making 

progress toward our climate ambitions. Our 
bottling partners have a major influence on 

emissions reductions based on what they buy, 

make and deliver for our shared customers  

and consumers.

In September 2022, Arca Continental committed 

to setting a science-based target. This adds to 

the growing list of our bottlers with approved 

emissions reductions goals through the Science-

Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This list includes 

Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (CCHBC),  

Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP), AB Inbev, 

Swire Coca-Cola Limited and Coca-Cola FEMSA.

Thanks to The Coca-Cola Company, in April 

2022 we had the great opportunity to join the 

Supplier LoCT initiative. This program helped us 

to improve the way we calculate our Scope 1 & 2 

emissions and to calculate our Scope 3 emissions 

for the first time. Last November, we committed 

to setting a science-based emissions target.” 

NICOLAS LOOTENS
 Group Sustainability Manager,  
Vetropak

In total, more than 160 of our suppliers have  

set or committed to setting SBTi-approved 

emissions targets. 

We will be working to grow this list in 2023.

ReducingEmissionsfromCoolers

ENGAGING WITH SUPPLIERS TO TAKE ACTION  
ON CLIMATE

Coolers have long been a key opportunity 

because approximately one-third of our 

emissions comes from cold-drink equipment and 

dispensing. In early 2023, building on analysis 

We continue to find new ways to collaborate  

we conducted in 2022, we published internal 

and support our suppliers to collectively

which will require increasing energy efficiency 

between now and 2030 and help drive the

We are also installing more “intelligent 

suppliers with resources, tools and knowledge

suppliers. The program is showing signs of 

success—10 suppliers that we sponsored, who 

successfully completed the program, have since 

set or committed to setting their own SBTi-

approved emissions targets.

In 2022, 88% of all new coolers placed were 

HFC-free. This is an increase from 61% of coolers 

placed in 2016.

MANAGING CLIMATE RISK

Our Risk Steering Committee oversees regular 

system-wide risk assessments. We integrate 

climate risk planning into this cross-functional 

and cross-company Enterprise Risk Management 

(ERM) process. We regularly evaluate commodity-

specific risks and resilience associated with 

climate impacts on water and our supply chain. 

Risks that could materially affect our business, 

financial condition and results of operations 

are disclosed in the company's Annual Report 

on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 

2022. This includes risks related to the effects of 

climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives 

to address climate change. Our management 

team works to mitigate these risks through, 

among other things, business continuity planning, 

setting targets that drive efficiency and making 

investments to improve our performance and 

increase resilience. Ultimately, the Corporate 

Governance and Sustainability Committee of our 

Board of Directors oversees climate-related risks.

WHAT’S NEXT?

AccountingforLandUseEmissions

In line with the launch of the SBTi’s Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) requirements, we are 

working to update our current science-based target in line with this methodology and a more 

ambitious trajectory. This new target would consider emissions from land use change in our 

supply chain as part of our overall GHG footprint and would consider carbon sequestration 

from land-based projects we implement in our supply chain. While we already work closely 

with suppliers to engage on water and sustainable agriculture, accounting for land use 

emissions would require an even closer partnership with our agricultural suppliers. As we 

incorporate more work across the agricultural supply chain, this would also help us meet 

evolving climate risk and data disclosure requirements.

IMPROVING DATA SCOPE AND ACCURACY

Gathering complete and accurate data is critical 

to identifying a path to achieving our science-

based target. We are continuously improving the 

scope and detail of our data collection to ensure 

all significant sources of emissions across our 

value chain are included in our inventory. We are 

updating our 2015 baseline data due to recent 
acquisitions. Improving our data helps us prioritize 

projects and programs with the greatest impact, 

including more detail on renewable energy usage 

and more data from suppliers.

ValidateRenewableEnergyClaims

One area of focus has been to validate the 

accuracy and completeness of our renewable 

understand our supply chain, drive change and 

energy claims. We have done this through 

more accurately track emissions reductions of 

assuring our claims to the GHG Protocol. This 

specific suppliers and commodities in key areas.

Even deeper in our supply chain, work is 

underway to map and understand how land, 

water use and farming practices in our major 

agricultural sourcing regions both generate 

emissions and have the potential to reduce 

emissions. Costa began its own work in 2022, 

launching a Climate Smart coffee project in 

partnership with the Rainforest Alliance. Phase 

1 of the project has been to conduct a GHG 
feasibility study to better understand the carbon 

footprint of coffee farms from Costa’s key 

sourcing origins, including Colombia and Brazil. 

This study is being used to inform the design of 

scalable climate mitigation interventions.

work began in 2021 and continued through 2022.

SuppliersDiscloseDataandTargets

Because approximately 85% of our total carbon 

emissions come from goods and services we 

buy, it is essential to engage with suppliers to 

accurately capture our full scope 3 emissions and 

ensure our suppliers join our decarbonization 

journey. Each year, we encourage key suppliers 
to complete CDP’s Supply Chain Climate Change 

questionnaire, which provides useful data on  

GHG emissions in our supply chain and 

information on supplier targets and initiatives to 

reduce emissions. In 2022, 378 suppliers provided 

climate data to CDP out of 495 requested,  

a 12% increase from 2021. 

Additionally, we are working to improve data 

accuracy in partnership with several major 

suppliers across ingredients and packaging, 

starting with sugar and aluminum, in order to 

develop supplier-specific emissions factors for the 

commodities we procure. This allows us to better

Our products and some of our packaging are made 
from a wide variety of agricultural ingredients which 
we source from around the world. Our goal is to 
sustainably source all our ingredients over time.  
We publicly report on our 12 global priority 
ingredients—such as sugar, corn, fruit, coffee, tea 
and soybeans. Sustainably sourcing our ingredients 
increases the resilience of our supply chain, helps to 
conserve nature and empowers producers and farm 
workers. In practice, we encourage and support our 
ingredient suppliers to drive continuous improvement 
in sustainable farming practices, based on our 
Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA).

1   Leader standard represents supply volume verified to a company-approved, third-party validation,

PRINCIPLES FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

IMPROVING WATER MANAGEMENT TO GROW OUR INGREDIENTS

Thriving farmers and farming 
communities are critically 
important for our supply chain. 
Our ability to deliver quality 
products depends on having a 
sustainable and secure supply of 
agricultural ingredients. 

Our complex supply chain spans the globe 

and includes many kinds of suppliers, from 

BasedonthePSAframework,
suppliersaredesignatedas:

•  LEADER: Supply volume is verified to 

company approved standards, with third-
party assurance aligned with the PSA.1 
•  MOVER: Supply volume is sourced from 
farms using other agricultural farming 
standards, effectively identifying and 

addressing key sustainability issues and 

multinational companies to smallholder farmers.

communicate our expectations for environmental, 

from smallholder/small-scale producers 

participating in a support program 

to continuously improve their priority 

sustainability practices.

Ourlong-termambitionistwo-fold:

•    All of our agricultural-based suppliers will 

demonstrate continuous improvement and will 

be categorized by The Coca-Cola Company as 

either a Leader, Mover or Improver.

•    All of our global priority ingredient suppliers and 

their farm supply base will work toward achieving 

“Leader” status over time.

social and economic performance to our 

agricultural suppliers at the farm level.

The PSA, introduced in 2021 to replace our 

Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP), 

take a long-term perspective and reflect the most 

recent science, our total beverage portfolio, and 

our increasingly diverse supply chain. The PSA are 

designed to encourage continuous improvement 

in farming practices and lead to more ethical and 

sustainable sourcing. 

The PSA framework for evaluating the compliance 

and performance of our supply farm base 

recognizes the on-the-ground realities in 

sustainable farming practices across a diversity of 

supply chains, farm structures and risk contexts. 

Based on the PSA framework, suppliers are 

designated as either a Leader, Mover or Improver.  

We are currently analyzing against the PSA 

framework the volume of the 12 global priority 

ingredients we procure. This mapping, which  

we aim to complete by the end of 2025, will help 

determine how we engage with suppliers to  

drive continuous improvement.

In 2022, 64% of our global priority ingredient 

volumes were sustainably sourced to our 

Leader standard, in line with our PSA. We 

currently only report our Leader-level volumes 

publicly. We do not currently report Mover or 

Improver volumes publicly.

Irrigated agriculture remains the 
largest user of water globally, 
accounting for 70% of water use 
worldwide,3 and has significant 
impacts on watershed health. 

Agriculture is also one of the sectors most 

impacted by water stress and drought.

Water use within our agriculture supply chain 

accounts for the vast majority of the surface water 

and groundwater consumed in the production of 

our beverages. Therefore, we are working with 

our suppliers to help promote the long-term 

sustainability of water resources through the 

implementation of advanced water management 

practices at the farm level.

In addition, we are including our priority sourcing 

regions as part of our water replenishment 

programs. For example, in 2022, in partnership 

with Doktar, an agri-tech company, and with 

funding from The Coca-Cola Foundation, we 

launched a project in the regions of Bursa and 

Tekirdağ in Türkiye, which are priority sourcing 

regions for apples. The project aims to improve 

irrigation efficiency and agricultural practices on 

approximately 500 acres of land growing apples,

SUPPORTING SMALLHOLDER FARMERS

SUPPORTING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES

Regenerative agriculture is often 
referred to as a system of farming 
that focuses on positive outcomes 
that ensure the long-term viability 
of land to sustain production 
by working “with nature” 
rather than against it. 

A number of our completed and ongoing projects 

promote sustainable agriculture practices (e.g., 

use of cover crops) and contribute to positive 

outcomes, including reduced soil erosion and the 

buildup of organic matter.

We will use key learnings from these projects 

to inform the design of future projects 

and incorporate regenerative agriculture 

principles and practices.

As a founding member of the SAI Platform’s 

Regenerative Agriculture Framework, we are 

supporting the development of an industry 

solution for measuring outcomes of regenerative 

agriculture practices at the farm level. We are 

also actively involved with SAI Platform’s work 

on the Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA), a 

global verification framework and benchmark 

reference designed to accelerate sustainable 

agriculture. The latest version, FSA 3.0, includes a 

self-assessment questionnaire and a continuous 

improvement module that offers guidance 

for developing, implementing and monitoring 

performance improvement plans.

Smallholder farmers play an 
essential role in our supply chain. 

Their livelihoods can be particularly vulnerable 

because they lack the resources and scale of 

commercial farmers. We partner with a range of 

nonprofits, communities, industry organizations 

and other companies to support smallholder 

farmers in becoming more efficient and 

productive while improving water and climate 

footprints, managing soil health, maintaining 

crop protection, and respecting the human rights 

of their workforce and labor contractors. The 

“Improver” category of our PSA segmentation 

includes smallholders who may never be 

able to gain formal certification but who can, 

with appropriate support, contribute to more 

sustainable and regenerative agriculture while 

increasing their own incomes and resilience.

For details on how we address human rights 

risks in our agricultural supply chain, see the 

Human Rights section.

StrengtheningSustainable
ProductionofOrangesinBrazil

We are working with partners to support 

smallholder farmers in Brazil’s citrus 

sector, which is the largest in the world. 

Many smallholder farmers in Brazil 

have struggled, particularly during 

the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of an 

industry initiative named Fruto Resiliente, 

which began in 2019, we are partnering

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

aims to improve sustainable agriculture 

practices in the production of oranges 

by providing training to smallholders, 

including female farmers, in topics such 

as water, soil management and labor 

standards. Technical materials and 

resources (including booklets, podcasts, 

and videos) are shared for free online, and 

smallholders benefit from field visits to a 

demonstration farm operated by Sylvio 

Moreira Citrus Research Center (CCSM) 

of the Agronomic Institute (IAC). With 

project support, this state experimental 
farm reached the FSA/SAI gold level1. 
In 2022, the project directly assisted 

approximately 200 orange farms.

ApplyingCompostDrivesPositiveOutcomes 
forEgyptianVegetableFarmers

Agriculture in Egypt faces many challenges, including water scarcity, water pollution, desertification 

and land degradation. Through a grant from The Coca-Cola Foundation to Global Water 

Challenge (GWC), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Egypt Network for 

Sustainable Development (ENID) implemented a project in the Qena governorate in Upper Egypt 

to demonstrate the value of using a greenhouse cultivation model to produce vegetables (e.g., 

eggplants and tomatoes), and the recycling and use of crop residues (materials left over after 

a crop harvest, e.g., stalks and stems) as compost on local farms. Local farmers and laborers 

received equipment and training in these improved farming techniques. 

The application of compost increased the soil moisture holding capacity on farmland and 

reduced the need for synthetic fertilizer. It is estimated that composting reduced the use of water 

for irrigation by as much as 23%. This decreased farming costs and generated an additional 

revenue stream for farmers. The recycling of crop residues provided income and short-term job 

opportunities for local residents along with longer-term employment prospects for approximately 

500 individuals, including almost 100 women, who received training in the production and 

application of compost. The project also reduced the need for burning, which is the traditional way 

of disposing of agricultural waste.

In partnership with Biofábrica Siglo XXI, 

an agro-biotechnological company, and 

Unión Nacional de Cañeros, A.C.–CNPR, 

one of the most important canegrower 

organizations in Mexico, we developed 

a project in 2021–2022 in Huasteca 

Potosina and the state of Morelos in 

Mexico to demonstrate the positive 

outcomes of regenerative agriculture 

practices in the production of sugarcane. 

Farming practices promoted include 

the use of biofertilizers—made from 

microorganisms—and compost. The 

24-month project is expected to show 

that such a production model can 

increase productivity, reduce the need 

for chemical fertilizer, improve soil health 

and increase carbon sequestration and 

retention. In 2022, the project was one of 

the winners of the Bonsucro Impact Fund.

Respecting human rights is  
one of our core values. 

The Coca-Cola Company was among the first 

companies to commit to the United Nations 

Guiding Principles on Business and Human 

Rights in 2011, and we have strived to inspire and 

drive responsible business practices ever since, 

embedding respect for human rights across our 

business and value chain. 

REAL IMPACT: SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE FUTURE

The foundation of our human rights program is 

our commitment to continuous improvement. 

That’s why, in 2022, we engaged a human 

rights advisory firm to conduct a holistic and 

rigorous review of our human rights program 

to ensure that we remain at the vanguard of 

responsible business. 

The process included extensive engagement with 

internal and external stakeholders to understand 

their primary human rights concerns and their 

expectations of an industry-leading program. 

We also conducted a global risk assessment to 
identify salient human rights risks1 across our 
global value chain and evaluate the strength of 

our governance to meet future challenges. The 

aim of this extensive analysis was to establish 

a framework to drive meaningful human rights 

progress across our operations and value chain. 

The result of our year-long assessment is Real
Impact, a new vision for the company’s human 
rights program. Our mission is to take actions 

that lead to a better tomorrow. We will take the 

lessons learned from existing programs and 

partnerships and seek to scale and adapt best 

practices across more geographies to deliver real 

impact to more people across our value chain. We 

will work to drive progress across our company, 

our industry and beyond through rigorous 

analysis, creative partnerships and constant 

innovation to turn commitment into action.

1   Salient human rights risks are human rights at risk of the most 
severe negative impact through a company’s activities and 
business relationships. 

OurNewFrameworktoTransformTomorrow

ThefutureofhumanrightsatTheCoca-ColaCompanyisempowerment.

Real Impact is our new framework for tomorrow. It is about respecting rights while working to drive progress. We will seek 

to bring enduring changes to the lives of those we touch around the world. To make our ambition concrete, Real Impact is 

grounded in three signature initiatives.

SECTIONSCOPE: In this section, our Human Rights Policy and Supplier Guiding Principle audits refer to actions by the company as 
well as our owned and independent bottling partners and our Tier 1 independent suppliers and partners.

OUR COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS

As a part of our Real Impact framework, we are 

renewing and refining our Human Rights Policy. 

The new Policy will draw on our stakeholder 

engagement and risk assessment to better 

align with the UN Guiding Principles on Business 

and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for 

Multinational Enterprises.

The rights underpinning our commitment  

are drawn from the International Bill of Human 
Rights, the ILO Core Conventions, and other 

instruments foundational to the dignity of 

vulnerable stakeholders. While we are committed 

to respecting all human rights, we have identified 

10 of our most salient issues: 

1.     Safe and healthy workplace 

2.    Diversity and inclusion 

3.    Freedom of association 

4.    Prohibition on slavery and forced labor 

5.    Prohibition of child labor 

6.    Work hours, wages, and benefits 

7.    Land rights 

8.    Water and environmental stewardship 

9.    Privacy

10.   Consumer wellbeing 

Our Human Rights Policy is embedded in 

expectations of our employees through the 

company’s Code of Business Conduct, and  

its precepts are extended through our 
supply chain through the Supplier Guiding 

Principles (SGP) and our Principles for 

Sustainable Agriculture (PSA). 

In line with the UN Guiding Principles, we carry 

out human rights due diligence across our value 

chain. We regularly assess our key human rights 

risks to ensure that we are taking sufficient steps 

to identify and address them and, if needed, to 

support remediation of impacts.

LIVING WAGE

As part of our commitment to respect human 

rights, we are actively engaging on the topic 
of a living wage. Over the past year, we have 
partnered with Business for Social Responsibility 

(BSR) to conduct a rigorous living wage gap 

analysis across our global offices and company-

owned manufacturing sites. While further 

analysis is needed, we are proud to meet or 

exceed the BSR living wage benchmark in the 
vast majority of our own operations. Where 

gaps exist, we will be developing a roadmap to 

progress toward a living wage. We have also 

been working with peers through AIM-Progress, a 

enactment of significant labor reforms and FIFA’s 

announcement of a Legacy Fund to establish 

a labor excellence hub in partnership with the 

International Labor Organization.

INFORMAL WASTE COLLECTION WORKERS  
& HUMAN RIGHTS 

The Coca-Cola Company has been a leader in 

driving ambitious sustainable packaging through 

our World Without Waste program. We have 

collaborated with peers across our industry, 

government, and civil society to tackle the issue 

of ocean-bound plastics. 

HUMAN RIGHTS CONFERENCE 

In October, The Coca-Cola Company was delighted 

to host the 14th Annual Engaging Business Forum 

at our headquarters in Atlanta. Sponsored by 

the International Organization of Employers, the 

United States Council for International Business 

and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Forum 

has become one of the preeminent business 

and human rights conferences, where business 

leaders and experts from civil society, trade 
unions and governments hold candid discussions 

on business experience in respecting human 

rights across their operations and supply chains. 

The theme of this latest Forum was The Future of

SPORTS & HUMAN RIGHTS 

The Coca-Cola Company is a long-time sponsor 

of global sporting events, including the Olympic 

Games and the FIFA World Cup. As a sponsor, 

the company has worked consistently with 

sport governing bodies, NGOs, governments, 

and unions to embed respect for human rights 

into the life cycle of these events. This work 
includes our leadership in the Centre for Sport 

to human rights abuse. The severity and 

complexity of human rights impacts on grassroots 

recyclers makes multi-stakeholder collaboration 

essential. In 2022, we partnered with other 

leading consumer goods companies and NGOs  

to launch the Fair Circularity Principles, which 

apply the expectations and responsibilities in the 

UN Guiding Principles to grassroots recycling.

improve the adoption of sustainable and responsible labor practices in sugar 

production and develop remediation plans to address child labor and forced labor 

prevalent in the industry. In November 2022, AgNovate delivered the first training 

session of the project to 31 participants, including managers of sugar mills. The 

training was based on GoodWeave’s best practices on ending child and worker 

exploitation. Gap assessments were then conducted of the six partner sugar mills 

and selected smallholder farmers on their compliance with the requirements of 

the Bonsucro Production Standard, which includes ensuring workers do not suffer 

from forced labor and there is no child labor. The project will support the mills to 

develop their own action plans toward continuous improvement and compliance 

with version 5.1 of the Bonsucro Production Standard.

We have strengthened our health and 

safety strategy with multi-year purposeful 

actions across our end-to-end supply 

chain. We have committed to integrating 

the Human and Organizational 

Performance (HOP) philosophy into our 

operational learning processes; building 

an environment of active employee 

engagement; accelerating learning and 

improvement processes; building better 

controls based on work in practice; and 

supporting the right culture. 

Several of our bottling partners across 

regions have deployed HOP operational 

learning into their organizations.  

To date, over 100 operations across our 

system have begun integrating HOP 

principles with significant improvements, 

and this journey will continue in 2023  

Our “Zero Is Possible” vision aims to identify risks and control

safe and healthy workplaces and supporting a culture 

of continuous learning and improvement. Management 

commitment and strong employee engagement are 

foundational to establishing this culture. 

•    SERIOUSINCIDENTPREVENTION: We expanded our self-
assessments and governance audits beyond production 

operations to include fleet and distribution operations 

(route-to-market). We continue our focus on identifying, 

We have implemented comprehensive, preventative 

implementing and strengthening controls to prevent serious 

programs to further identify and mitigate the potential for 

injuries. We also continue to build unique solutions (i.e., 

serious incidents to occur in our facilities. We are integrating 

toolkits, guidance) to enhance the capacity and capability of 

operational learning while also demonstrating progress  

our system in identifying and mitigating risks.  

and embedding safety as a key organizational value.

In2022,wefocusedonthreekeypillarsofour 

in new technologies and shared learnings across the

•    CULTURE: We revamped our Safety Training Academy in 
2022, providing enhanced resources, tools and training 

which include operational safety and road safety programs. 

As part of our approach to safety culture across the 

Coca-Cola system, we incorporated a new Human and 

organization. We completed more than 20 technology pilots 

globally, which are now being implemented by many of 

our bottling partners. These include AI technology camera 

systems to detect unsafe conditions and driver simulators to 

train and prepare drivers, among others.

Safe, high-quality drinks people can trust, and a 

safe, secure workplace are an essential part of 
who we are at The Coca-Cola Company. Although 

we have seen significant improvements in our 

safety performance, we know there is more 

to be done. By building capabilities across our 

system, identifying where we need to improve, 

leveraging industry best practices and engaging 

with our employees, we are working toward our 

vision of “Zero Is Possible” as it relates to serious 

injuries in the workplace.”

EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK

Pay equity is defined as compensating employees fairly and 

equitably, without regard to gender (globally), or race and 

ethnicity (in the United States). On an annual basis, we conduct 

audits to ensure our employees are paid equitably. Additionally, 
we are diligent and stay aware of the changing regulatory 

landscape. In 2022, we published our first-ever pay gap report 

for Coca-Cola Ireland.

BUILDING AN INCLUSIVE CULTURE

In 2022, we added specific inclusion-related questions to our

baseline for an Inclusion Index reflecting employee sentiment 

about belonging, fairness, respect and psychological safety, 

as well as conditions and behaviors that create an inclusive 

environment at our company.

Our employee-led Inclusion Networks serve as valuable resources

By 2030, we aspire to be 50% led by women globally and, in the United States, 
to align race and ethnicity representation to U.S. census data. While these metrics 
are important indicators of our progress, we are taking an iterative and holistic 
approach focused on continuous learning. Here’s a 2022 update on our progress

CHALLENGING OURSELVES TO  
EMPOWER COMMUNITIES 

The Coca-Cola North America operating unit 

recently launched Asian Pacific, Black and 

Hispanic Equity Accountability Councils (EACs) to 

guide community engagement and investment, 
with an emphasis on economic equity. The 

EACs are designed to drive quality of life 

improvements in under-resourced communities 

through economic mobility, financial stability and 

the well-being of individuals and households. 

The councils will identify initiatives that reflect 

diversity in communities which have direct links 

to our DEI strategy.

DRIVING ACCOUNTABILITY

To continue progress toward achieving our 

sustainability goals, the Talent and Compensation 

Committee approved DEI links to executive 

compensation as part of the annual incentive 

for our executive officers, which will help drive 

our 2030 DEI aspirations. The links to executive 

compensation are based on achieving predefined 

qualitative and quantitative DEI components.

TRANSPARENCY AND REPORTING

We believe in full transparency and disclosure. 

We share diversity metrics quarterly with 

senior leaders, and we externally publish 

our representation data annually by race/

ethnicity (U.S.) and gender (globally) for our 

overall workforce and leadership. We publish

RECRUITING AND DEVELOPING DIVERSE TALENT

In 2022, we continued to enhance 
our diversity hiring efforts through 
equitable recruitment, interviewing 
and onboarding processes. 

We expanded our partnerships with Historically 

Black Colleges and Universities as well as 

leadership development organizations, including 

the National Black MBA Association, Executive 

Leadership Council and Thurgood Marshall 

National Black Talent Bank.

SUPPLIER DIVERSITY

Coca-Cola is working to maximize 
procurement opportunities  
and proactively engaging and 
building partnerships with diverse-
owned suppliers spanning a  
range of industries.

We are focused on increasing the overall diversity 

of our suppliers and are working to spend at 

least $1 billion annually with diverse suppliers. We 

aspire to join the Billion Dollar Roundtable—the 

gold standard of supplier diversity, currently with 

only 27 member companies.

In 2022, our supplier diversity team connected 

independent Coca-Cola bottlers in the United 

States and Canada with business partners 

to boost our overall impact via sponsored 

matchmaking events at the National Minority 

Supplier Development Council and Women’s 

Business Enterprise National Council conferences. 

The team is exploring ways to expand our supplier 

diversity program internationally.

$900M+ 

spent in 2022 with diverse  
Tier 1 suppliers in the United 
States, an increase over prior 
years and progress toward our  
$1 billion annual goal.

$200M 

of incremental spend with  
Black-owned enterprises in the 
United States, contributing to  
the company’s overall goal of 
$500 million.

Crowdfundingfor

SmallBusiness

We are a founding sponsor of Rise Up Crowdfunding, an equity 

crowdfunding portal focused on women and minority-owned 

businesses. The platform connects diverse startups with 

investors to expand access to capital while also providing 

business management resources and coaching.

We share Rise Up’s mission to support businesses and 

underrepresented groups within the communities we 

serve. This much-needed resource can, in many cases, 

help small businesses scale up or expand their operations, 

open new locations and grow their brands.”

economic empowerment efforts deliver tangible 

results in markets around the world, where we 

harness partnerships and deliver programs 

tailored to local needs and nuances. This work 

builds on the momentum created by our  

decade-long 5by20® program, created in 2010  

to enable the economic empowerment of  

5 million women entrepreneurs. Together with our 

public and private sector partners, including our 

bottling partners and The Coca-Cola Foundation, 

we exceeded our target, enabling the economic 

empowerment of more than 6 million women. 

SECTIONSCOPE: In this section our 
economic empowerment work refers to 

actions by the company, The Coca-Cola 

Foundation, our owned and independent 

bottling partners and our independent 

suppliers and partners.

We have seen evidence that helping female 

entrepreneurs overcome social and economic 

barriers to success creates a ripple effect in local 

communities with both societal and commercial 

impacts. According to a 2015 McKinsey Global 

Institute report, if women were to play an identical 

role in the global labor market to that of men, it is 

estimated that $28 trillion could be added to the 

global gross domestic product (GDP).

While women’s entrepreneurship continues to 

play an active role in business sustainability, 

we are broadening economic empowerment 

efforts to help create shared value—and a better 

shared future—through training, networking 

and mentoring programs aimed at working with 

underrepresented groups. These programs focus 

on building financial and digital literacy and 

enabling access to opportunities through our 

supplier diversity work.

Economic empowerment is  
one of The Coca-Cola Foundation’s 
six new priority giving pillars.  
The Coca-Cola Foundation envisions 
inclusive economies around the 
world with expanded opportunities 
for shared prosperity, especially for  
the communities that face the 
greatest barriers to advancing  
their well-being.

•   In Eswatini, The Coca-Cola Foundation supported the Ministry of Health’s 

Project Last Mile to strengthen the government’s capacity to store ultra-

cold chain COVID-19 vaccines. 

•   Coca-Cola Europacific Partners is supporting the hospitality industry 

across Spain to measure their emissions, identify emissions reduction 

opportunities and offset emissions to help reach carbon neutrality 

through the Hosteleria #PorElClima campaign.

ImprovingWatershedHealthinPakistan

We worked with WWF-Pakistan to develop a watershed 

stewardship plan for the Ravi River watershed, a sub-basin of 

the Indus River Basin, and a priority watershed because it is a 
key ingredient sourcing (sugarcane) and market growth region. 

The river extends through both India and Pakistan and supports 

approximately 38 million people. Our analysis found that the 

river faces increasing water scarcity and quality challenges. The 

plan addresses infrastructure and ecosystems, community well-

being, information management, policy and regulations, finance 

and planning. One project already underway is a partnership 

with WWF-Pakistan to address the identified water issues for 

approximately 360,000 people in Lahore. Between 2022–2023, 

the project will install household rainwater harvesting systems, 

recharge wells to replenish a groundwater aquifer, reforest 

urban areas and construct floating treatment wetlands. The 

treatment wetlands will allow wastewater to be reused for 

agriculture purposes and remove pollutants and excess 

nutrients from village ponds.

2022 HIGHLIGHTS

•   Coca-Cola Brazil joined the Yes to Racial Equality program run by the 

Identities of Brazil Institute to help generate opportunities for 3 million 

people in the coming years, and 10,000 new leadership positions for 

black people by 2030.

•   Coca-Cola Argentina and four bottling partners launched “Ruta 

Verde” or the “Green Road”, a recycling project that aims to increase 

the recovery of materials at collection points. This new project 

connects 28 municipalities across three provinces and helps more 

than 590,000 people access public places to recycle plastic, paper, 

cardboard, glass and cans.

•   In the face of the 2022 water shortage in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, Coca-Cola 

and its bottling partners responded quickly to implement additional 

measures including rehabilitating 15 public water wells, with the goal of 

expanding water access to families throughout the city of Monterrey and 

its more than 5 million inhabitants. We also continued to provide clean 

drinking water, at all times, free of charge, to local families through an 

outdoor faucet at the Topo Chico bottling plant. 

•   Funded by The Coca-Cola Foundation, the Safe Water project in 

Pucusana, Peru, focused on providing running water systems for the 

soup kitchens in the district, guaranteeing adequate hygienic conditions 

for meal preparation. The project installed elevated water tanks and 

piping for each community kitchen, allowing proper washing of the 

ingredients. Safe Water for Pucusana has installed 19 running water 

systems, guaranteeing safe meal preparation for more than 1,600 

neighbors and users of the community kitchens.

EncouragingConsumerstoShopLocal

Coca-Cola launched the “Little 

Giants” or “Pequeños Gigantes” 

campaign in Latin America to 

encourage consumers to buy 

from their local store or market. 

The project demonstrates the 

importance of these mini markets 

in every neighborhood and 

the role of consumers and companies to contribute to their 

growth. This campaign was launched in Colombia, Peru, Costa 

Rica, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and other countries 

in Latin America as part of our efforts to promote the economic 

development and empowerment of the traditional trade.

2022 HIGHLIGHTS

•   The company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink 

beverages for the year, driven by the continued recovery in away-from-

home channels along with strong performance in at-home channels for 

sparkling soft drinks and value-added dairy beverages. 

•   In 2022, Sprite began shifting all of its plastic packaging from green 

to clear, which helps with the recycling process and increases the 

material’s likelihood of being remade into new beverage bottles. 

Coca-Cola North America’s entire green plastic portfolio—including 

packaging for Fresca, Seagram’s and Mello Yello—is also making the 

transition to clear PET. 

•   The Coca-Cola Company donated $2 million to support the Smithsonian’s 

landmark new National Museum of the American Latino and Molina 

Family Latino Gallery. The museum will showcase Latino achievements 

and stories in U.S. art, history, culture and science, and will be built 

over a 10-year period. 

•   Minute Maid launched Aguas Frescas, a Latin American-inspired, 

noncarbonated beverage made with real fruit juices and natural flavors. 

The juice drinks deliver a bold, “refreshing AF” sensorial experience 

tailored to Gen Z tastes.

DASANI100%rPETLaunch

A majority of DASANI 

bottles in the United 

States—from 20-oz. and 

1.5-liter singles to 10-oz. 

and 12-oz. multipacks—

are now offered in 100% 
recycled plastic1. In 
Canada, this innovation 

spans all DASANI bottles. 

The brand’s transition to 
100% recycled plastic1 
is projected to save 

more than 20 million pounds of new plastic, compared to 

2019, and cut more than 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas 

emissions in 2023 alone.

SCOPE OF THE REPORT
This 2022 Business & Sustainability Report is  
The Coca-Cola Company’s fifth report to integrate 
overall business and sustainability performance, data 
and context, reflecting our continued journey toward 
driving sustainable business practices into our core 
strategy. This report has been prepared in accordance 
with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core 
option. In addition, we provide indices for the standards 
set by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
(SASB), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures, the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), the United Nations Global Compact 
(UNGC) and the United Nations Guiding Principles 
Reporting Framework (UNGPRF).

Limited assurance under attestation standards 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
over select sustainability metrics was obtained from 
Ernst & Young LLP (as indicated in the Independent 
Accountant’s Review Report).

Except as otherwise noted, this report covers the  
2022 performance of The Coca-Cola Company and the  
Coca-Cola system (our company and our owned 
and independent bottling partners), as applicable. 
Therefore, references to “currently,” “to date” or 
similar expressions reflect data and information as of 
December 31, 2022. Some initiatives that were launched 
in early 2023 are included to provide the most relevant 
information to stakeholders.

In this report, any use of the terms “material,” 
“materiality,” “immaterial,” “substantive,” “significant” 
and other similar terminology refers to topics that reflect 
important economic, environmental and social impacts 
of The Coca-Cola Company or the Coca-Cola system 
or to topics or standards designated as “material” or 
“substantive” under the GHG Protocol, GRI or SASB 
standards. These terms as used in this report are not 
used, or intended to be construed, as they have been 
defined by or construed in accordance with the securities 
laws or any other laws of the United States or any other 
jurisdiction, or as these terms are used in the context of 
financial statements and financial reporting.

The data presented in this report is collected using 
accepted and relevant scientific and industry accepted 
methodologies, which in some instances, are based 
on assumptions and estimates. Although our data has 
been internally vetted, there are inherent uncertainties 
and limitations in the collection and presentation of 
our data. For example, certain information in this report 
regarding  the Coca-Cola system’s progress against 
our sustainability goals comes from third-party sources 
and operations outside of our control. While we believe 
such information is reasonably accurate and is based 
on generally accepted principles and methodology,  the 
collection of this data is beyond our direct influence. In 
addition, the achievement of certain of our sustainability 
goals and targets that are discussed in this report are 
dependent on the actions of our bottling partners, 
suppliers and other third parties, all of which are 
outside of our control. 

Historical performance data may be revised due to 
reasons such as new data availability; industry-driven 
changes to methodologies; improvement in data 
collection and measuring systems; or activities such as 
joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions or divestitures. 
In cases where historical information is revised, we will 
footnote the change with a clear explanation. Statements 
about future developments and past occurrences are 
based on information and assumptions available as 
of the date of publication. While we are committed 
to providing timely updates, the company holds no 
obligation to update information or statements.

ReconciliationofGAAPandNon-GAAPFinancialMeasures 

The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP” or 
referred to herein as “reported”). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional 
meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. Management 
also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the 
company’s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company’s reported 
results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. 

For additional details regarding the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, see the company’s Current Reports on 
Form 8-K filed with the SEC on Feb. 14, 2023, Feb. 10, 2022, Feb. 10, 2021 and Jan. 30, 2020. This information is also available in the “Investors”

 This is the focused scope of Primary Consumer Packaging (PET, Glass, Cans, Cartons).

2   This number has been updated following the completed assurance process for the 2020 World Without Waste Report, which was completed post-publication of the 2020 Business & ESG Report.

3  Includes select Primary Consumer Packaging materials.

4   In 2019, we modified the methodology we use for calculating the amount of recycled material used in our Primary Consumer Packaging. These changes are designed to integrate a more accurate dataset, including 

primary data where it is available. Moving forward, we expect that these numbers will continue to evolve as data sources improve, at the same time that we work to increase rates of recycled material use.

5   We changed our method to track the packaging collection rate against our World Without Waste goal beginning with 2018 data. With better data available, we expanded the metric to encompass all of our packaging 

types, including beverage cartons, juice boxes and pouches, etc.

6   Collection rate represents a weighted average of national collection rates, collected for recycling rates or refillable rates by packaging type to TCCS’s sales in units to express the percent of equivalent bottles 
and cans introduced into the market that were collected and refilled or collected for recycling for the year. Collection rates are determined by country for each packaging type based on either national studies 
(approximately 82%), plant standards (approximately 17%), and internal estimates (approximately 1%).

7  Only recyclable where infrastructure exists.

 Substantially all replenish data is internally validated and verified; the equivalent volume for 100% Replenish rate (182.9 Billion litres BL) is externally assured. Peer-reviewed methodologies were used to calculate volumetric benefits per project and operating unit for all 
externally assured data; one exception was approved for internally validated and verified data. The replenish benefit is typically estimated as a long-term, average annual volume, but for some project activities it varies annually. Replenish benefits fall under three categories: 
Watershed Protection and Restoration (233.5 BL), Water for Productive Use (40.9 BL) and Water Access and Sanitation (17.4 BL). Due to joint venture or merger and acquisition activities in 2019–2022, certain brands may not be accounted for in this metric. Unless otherwise 
stated, in this report finished beverages is based on global sales volume. Approximately 13.5 BL (approx. 7%) of the water used in our beverages that we returned to nature and communities is from 7 projects located in Ukraine and Belarus where since May 2019 we have not 
been able to monitor projects on intervals aligned with internal guidelines due to COVID and the ongoing war. 

Note: Due to joint venture or merger and acquisition activities, certain brands may not be accounted for in The Coca-Cola Company-specific metrics included on this page.

 The direct, Scope 1 and indirect Scope 1 manufacturing emissions results shown in this section exclude fugitive emissions and flavor manufacturing plants. However, for 
the system-wide GHG results reported, these emissions sources are included.

4  The below emissions figures will be reported in the Company's forthcoming 2023 CDP Climate Change response.

5  Systemwide total based on estimated total use.

2  This metric accounts for renewable energy usage.

3   The GHG emissions reported in the Business & Sustainability report represent the Coca-Cola system’s manufacturing emissions, which include emissions from 

activities which are under the Company’s operational control and activities that are related to Coca-Cola brands that are under direct control of franchise bottlers. 
Our CDP reporting is aligned with an operational control approach as defined by the GHG Protocol, which includes only emissions from activities within The Coca-Cola 
Company’s operational control as Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while manufacturing emissions from franchise bottlers are categorized as “Scope 3- Franchises”.

 Includes reports and allegations raised through The Coca-Cola Company’s Human Rights Policy reporting process. 

3   This amount includes charitable grants awarded by The Coca-Cola Foundation and donations made by The Coca-Cola Company.

2   In 2019, Employee Relations redefined how cases were captured in the case management tool of record. Therefore, the reported figure includes only those allegations 
that required investigations only as opposed to generalized questions raised to Employee Relations. Please note, however, that all questions presented to Employee 
Relations were answered even if the question did not warrant an investigation. While we previously reported on all cases and questions raised through our case 
management tool, we no longer capture that data. This helps us to ensure that we have more accurate visibility to annual Human Rights cases. This change accounts for 
the 2019 variance when compared to previous years.

4  This percentage was calculated based on the company’s prior year operating income (excluding the Bottling Investments operating segment).

We build loved brands that bring joy to our consumers’ lives with beverage choices for all occasions, tastes and lifestyles.

Our growth strategy is grounded in our core values and commitment to social and environmental responsibility.

This 2022 Business Sustainability Report is The Coca Cola Company’s fifth report to integrate overall business and sustainability performance, data and context, reflecting our continued journey toward driving sustainable business practices into our core strategy.

Except as otherwise noted, this report covers the 2022 performance of The Coca Cola Company and the Coca Cola system (our company and our bottling partners), as applicable.

As used in this report, the terms material, materiality, immaterial, substantive, significant and other similar terminology are not used, or intended to be construed, as they have been defined by or construed in accordance with the securities laws or any other laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction or as they are used in the context of financial statements and financial reporting.

For detailed information on the scope of this report, please see About This Report on page 69.

The Coca Cola Company’s purpose is to refresh the world and make a difference.

We have remained true to that purpose for 137 years, and I am as encouraged today about the future of our business as I have ever been.

It’s centered around people our consumers and employees and driving sustainable solutions that build resilience into our business to respond to current and future challenges, while creating positive change for the planet.

As a total beverage company, we are committed to offering people more of the drinks they want across a range of categories and in a variety of sizes.

In 2022, we launched 246 low or no sugar beverages and continued to see double digit growth for Coca Cola Zero Sugar, which is now available in more than 170 markets.

This helped to drive our volume of low and no calorie beverage sales to 29% of total volume.

We’re driving the most significant marketing transformation in our history, focused on digital first engagement with consumers.

Coca Cola Creations: This global innovation platform lends the iconic Coca Cola brand to new expressions, driven by collaboration, creativity and cultural connection.

Launched in 2022, we introduced five limited edition drinks that drew inspiration from music, gaming and culture.

These were complemented with experimental packaging designs and various digital experiences.

Sprite Limelight: A music and cultural extension of the brand’s global platform Heat Happens, Sprite Limelight aims to unite fans from different cultures and lifestyles by bringing together different artists from around the world.

We’ve launched Jack Daniel’s Coca Cola as a ready to drink cocktail through a relationship with Brown Forman.

This is one example of our ongoing journey to bring Coke to consumers in new and dynamic ways.

We take the new responsibilities that come with our entry in this space very seriously.

As a result, we’ve embedded our Global Policy on Alcohol Responsibility into our business processes to ensure we grow our alcohol brands in a responsible and sustainable way.

Water: Water is a priority for our company because it is the first ingredient in all our beverages and is essential to the communities we serve.

As a local business operating in more than 200 countries and territories, we have a responsibility to help protect critical resources.

Our 2030 Water Security Strategy focuses on increasing water security.

We work with partners to provide access to a steady supply of clean water for people and ecosystems in the areas where we operate and source ingredients.

We recently announced a more focused effort to prioritize the most water stressed regions.

As we’ve done since 2015, we’ll continue to replenish the water we use in our finished beverages to nature and communities.

It’s centered around people our consumers and employees and driving sustainable solutions that build resilience into our business to respond to current and future challenges, while creating positive change for the planet.

Packaging: We seek to drive a circular economy for our packaging because this helps to reduce waste and carbon emissions.

We’re working to use more recycled content in our packaging, to expand our use of refillable bottles, and to collect packaging for recycling through our World Without Waste initiative.

We also partner to design new solutions for packaging.

For example, we licensed our technology for a 100% plant based plastic bottle to a company building a commercial scale facility in Germany.

This bio based plastic packaging has a lower carbon footprint than other plastics.

While we’re making progress, we know there is more work to be done.

In 2022, we collected 61% of the equivalent bottles and cans that we introduced into the market and used 15% rPET in our bottles.

To galvanize collective action, we invest in solutions and partnerships across industry, governments and society.

In 2022, we became a Strategic Partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

This group includes companies within key industry sectors that can help drive the transition to a circular economy.

Climate: Our water, packaging and climate goals are interconnected.

For example, by creating a circular economy for packaging, we can lower our carbon footprint.

By approaching water stewardship from a basin perspective, we participate in initiatives that increase communities’ resilience to extreme weather events, alongside our partners.

Our approach to climate is rooted in science, and we’ve set a science based target to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030, against a 2015 baseline.

As of 2022, we have reduced our emissions by 7% against this baseline.

We’re committed to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging and to driving meaningful change in our communities.

By 2030, we aspire to be 50% led by women globally.

The Coca Cola Foundation, the philanthropic arm of The Coca Cola Company, contributed 94.8 million to 301 organizations around the world in 2022 to help create a better shared future for the communities our business serves.

Our continued success would not be possible without our people.

I am grateful for the company and system employees who live our purpose every day.

Their collective passion and focus to build loved brands and make a difference in the world is how our business will continue to thrive for generations to come.

Our Board of Directors is proud of our company’s ongoing success.

As the business continues to grow and evolve, our Board also continues to evolve.

Through our Board refreshment efforts, we strive to maintain a balance of skills, tenure and diversity among our Directors.

I am extremely proud that in 2022 we achieved gender parity in the composition of our Board.

And as this report demonstrates, our actions and our business success remain grounded in our strong values and purpose: to refresh the world and make a difference.

Our 2030 Water Security Strategy is focused on accelerating the actions needed to increase water security where we operate, source ingredients and touch people’s lives.

We do that by contributing toward sustainable, clean water access that improves livelihoods and wellbeing while protecting against water related disasters.

We understand water challenges are different in each region, so we are focused on doing what matters most locally, where the challenges are greatest.

We have exceeded our 100% replenishment goal every year since 2015.

As a total beverage company, we are committed to offering people more of the drink choices they want across a range of categories and in a variety of packages.

Evolving consumer tastes and preferences help steer our business strategy and shape the lineup of beverages we bring to market.

We take a disciplined approach to product innovation and portfolio management, ensuring we develop and deliver preferred, great tasting beverages for all occasions and lifestyles.

This includes offering drinks with reduced added sugar and more brands with nutrition and wellness benefits providing small package options and clear nutrition information on packaging and in our communications and marketing our drinks responsibly.

We continue to use our marketing to drive growth of our low and no calorie portfolio.

Sugar has experienced double digit growth in five of the last six years.

In 2022, several leading low and no calorie brands in North America launched consumer campaigns with celebrity partners and sponsorship assets.

Peer reviewed methodologies were used to calculate volumetric benefits per project and operating unit for all externally assured data one exception was approved for internally validated and verified data.

The replenish benefit is typically estimated as a long term, average annual volume, but for some project activities it varies annually.

Replenish benefits fall under three categories: Watershed Protection and Restoration (233.5 BL), Water for Productive Use (40.9 BL) and Water Access and Sanitation (17.4 BL).

Due to joint venture or merger and acquisition activities between 2019 2022, certain brands may not be accounted for in this metric.

Unless otherwise stated, in this report finished beverages is based on global sales volume.

As of 2022, we reduced our absolute emissions by 7% against waste challenges facing our planet and society.

The Foundation’s Strategic Partners include some of the world’s largest and most influential organizations, with transformative potential to demonstrate what’s possible to accelerate the transition to a circular economy.

Water is a priority for The Coca Cola Company because it is essential to life, our beverages and the communities we serve.

It is also critical to public health, food security, biodiversity and the climate crisis.

The world is experiencing increased water insecurity, which is evident through water scarcity, with demands for safe, usable water exceeding supply in certain areas.

We have operations nearly everywhere in the world in more than 200 countries and territories.

That means we have a responsibility to accelerate our efforts to help address water stress, protect local water resources and help build community climate resilience communities’ ability to adapt to these changing conditions.

Peer reviewed methodologies were used to calculate volumetric benefits per project and operating unit for all externally assured data one exception was approved for internally validated and verified data.

The replenish benefit is typically estimated as a long term, average annual volume, but for some project activities it varies annually.

Replenish benefits fall under three categories: Watershed Protection and Restoration (233.5 BL), Water for Productive Use (40.9 BL) and Water Access and Sanitation (17.4 BL).

Due to joint venture or merger and acquisition activities between 2019 2022, certain brands may not be accounted for in this metric.

Foundation as well as our owned and independent bottling partners and our independent suppliers and partners.

Vision: Our 2030 Water Security Strategy is focused on accelerating the actions needed to increase water security where we operate, source ingredients and touch people’s lives.

We do that by contributing toward sustainable, clean water access that improves livelihoods and wellbeing while protecting against water related disasters.

We also work to preserve nature and biodiversity as well to promote advanced water management practices.

This means we will partner to build water resilience across operations and supply chains, and we will work together to achieve collective positive water impact in at least 100 vulnerable water basins by 2030.

Our 2030 strategy is grounded in the fact that water is a shared resource.

Over the last couple of years, we followed a process to segment and prioritize our operating facilities, commercial regions, sourcing regions for global priority ingredients, watersheds, and communities based on those with the highest water related risks (read more on the following page).

To achieve our goals, collective action is critical.

Achieve 100% regenerative water use across 175 of our facilities identified as facing high levels of water stress by 2030.

Improve the health of 60 watersheds identified as most critical for our operations and agricultural supply chain by 2030.

Return a total of 2 trillion liters of water to nature and communities globally between 2021 and 2030.

All three goals contribute to our commitment to maintain at least 100% global replenishment of the water used in our finished beverages.

Actions in Our Watersheds Our Communities Support nature based solutions.

Help farmers use less water and implement sustainable agriculture practices.

Help provide communities with access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).

Advocate for good water governance and smart policies.

In 2022, we completed our analysis of water related risks in areas where we can make the greatest impact1.

Watersheds Similarly, we undertook a comprehensive process to identify priority watersheds across our system.

These include our Leadership Locations and sourcing regions for global priority ingredients, their water sources, where we source global watersheds and communities. priority ingredients, key growth markets and priority communities.

Communities We also began mapping priority communities, concentrate plants and bottling facilities) and based on their lack of access to water, sanitation mapped the minor river basins and sourcing and hygiene (WASH) and resilience to water basins of these facilities.

Vulnerability Assessments our site level, internal proprietary tool. or in rural farming communities where we source ingredients.

ADVANCED EFFICIENCY LOCATIONS: System facility locations in a water stressed context that will drive advanced water efficiency improvements in operations.

Water Resource Sustainability Standard, achieving industry benchmark water efficiency and 100% compliance with wastewater discharge standards. a framework of prioritization and a deeper understanding of risks, which will help us develop holistic, integrated and context based approaches to help increase water security where it matters the most in our business, operations and supply chains.

Regenerative water use means facilities must reduce, reuse, recycle and replenish the water used in operations in the local correlated watersheds for beneficial social, economic and or environmental uses by other stakeholders and nature.

By mapping and overlaying our priority facilities, market growth regions.

In T rkiye, we identified an operating facility located in a water stressed area as a priority facility (Leadership Location) in the city of Bursa in the north west of the country.

The facility is owned and operated by our bottling partner Coca Cola ecek.

Further, we identified the Bursa Balikesir watershed as a priority because it not only serves as a water source for our facility but also because it supports the growing of apples, peaches and nectarines that we source as ingredients in our products.

The watershed faces high levels of water scarcity and pollution of water sources from local industries, including textiles and agriculture (e.g., use of insecticides).

This may lead to changes in the prioritized facilities, watersheds and communities.

All our production operations will continue to implement the Coca Cola system’s Water Resource Sustainability Standard. operational costs associated with water use.

Better understanding of these costs will help strengthen decision making and the business case for investment in initiatives that respond to local challenges.

The purpose of this standard is to identify and reduce water quality and quantity related challenges for our operations.

In the development of new plants, we leverage our Sustainability by Design Tool to ensure that water efficient processes are implemented and that we achieve best in class water efficiency.

We have set an ambitious target to reduce our water use ratio by 20% by 2030 from a 2015 baseline for all operations across the system.

Cost of Water We have partnered with denkstatt to develop a Cost of Water tool for our teams.

In addition, the watershed includes orchards from which the system sources apples.

The agricultural sector and the city of Cuauht moc are major water users.

The watershed is forecasted to face increasing water quality and quantity challenges in the coming years due to population growth and rising temperatures.

Coca Cola Mexico, our projects in this watershed have helped to improve rural communities’ access to water, mainly through rainwater harvesting systems and check dams.

The watershed stewardship plan completed in 2022 helped identify key context specific interventions to consider for future projects including, reforestation, rainwater harvesting, dams, plant nurseries, conservation of springs and community access to WASH, as well as the need to strengthen local partnerships.

These plans will also help us to track improvements in watershed health and co benefits of projects (e.g., enhanced biodiversity and carbon sequestration).

One project currently in the pipeline is working with an agri tech partner, Kilimo, to help local farmers save water by adopting technology enabled irrigation management tools.

Developing watershed stewardship plans at the catchment scale is critical to helping water users in a particular region identify and address the drivers of water risk.

Working with partners to implement solutions, stakeholders can take an effective science based approach to improve water resilience for both people and nature.

Protecting watersheds and recognizing the unique challenges and characteristics of water sources around the world has long been a focus of our work.

Watersheds supply water for drinking, agriculture and manufacturing provide habitat for plants and animals and offer opportunities for recreation.

Based on our 2030 Water Security Strategy, we are placing even greater emphasis on the holistic improvement of watershed health.

We set a goal to improve watershed health in 60 watersheds identified as most critical for our operations and agricultural supply chain by 2030.

Producing the ingredients used in our beverages accounts for an estimated 92% of our total blue water1 footprint, which is the volume of surface water and groundwater consumed in producing our finished products (evaporated or embedded in the product).

That’s why, in 2022, we expanded our analysis and prioritization to include watersheds that support our priority ingredient sourcing, in addition to our operating facilities and those necessary for key market growth.

The Coca Cola Foundation and the Coca Cola system have a long history of watershed projects.

These projects include support for nature based solutions such as reforestation, wetland and meadow restoration, as well as irrigation system improvements, invasive species removal and check dam construction.

Many of the projects work in agricultural contexts to improve availability of water for irrigation and more efficiently use water in agriculture.

We adopt a human rights based approach to water and communities.

We recognize the connection between our social license to operate and functional, resilient water infrastructure.

Recognizing that nature itself often offers the best mechanisms for restoring watershed health, the company, The Coca Cola Foundation and our bottling partners invest in nature based solutions (NBS), such as forest protection and floodplain management, which build on natural processes to manage water systems.

Through our work, we have learned that NBS projects often have multiple co benefits, such as better water quality, carbon sequestration, increased climate resilience, and enhanced richness and variety of life of natural habitats (biodiversity).

We worked with denkstatt to develop a methodology to help us quantify and test the co benefits of NBS projects.

In 2022, we partnered with the CEO Water Mandate, denkstatt and others to help build the business case for NBS by developing a standardized methodology to measure benefit accrual and a means to value social return on investment.

The methodology has been tested across several of our water replenishment projects in key geographies.

Our aim is to support public, private and non profit sectors in developing effective policies and programs to incentivize greater implementation of and investment in NBS because water is at the nexus of many goals, including protecting habitats, increasing biodiversity, sequestering carbon and promoting community resilience in the face of changing weather patterns.

We share resources to increase all our efforts and to generate a bigger impact.

And, we will invest in new recycling technologies for PET plastic and other packaging materials.

We see a significant opportunity to work more proactively with global and regional customers, many of which have announced their own sustainable packaging goals that can only be achieved in collaboration with key suppliers.

Looking ahead, we will build on our longstanding relationships to make collective progress.

Taking well informed, decisive action to help address climate change is a priority for our company.

Climate change poses risks to our business and our stakeholders.

By implementing an interconnected approach across our priority sustainability issues, we are reducing the Coca Cola system’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and building resilience in our business, value chain and local communities.

SECTION SCOPE: In this section our climate emissions reduction work refers to actions by the company as well as our owned and independent bottling partners and our independent suppliers and partners.

We are working to reduce our carbon footprint in line with science to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

We do this by analyzing and prioritizing the sources of GHG emissions across our value chain and by partnering with stakeholders to drive down those emissions.

As of 2022, we reduced our emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 7%,1 making progress toward our science based reduction target of 25% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline1.

Our ambition is to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Several of our bottling partners have announced their own science based targets and net zero pledges to drive climate action across the global Coca Cola system.

In 2022, our scope 1 emissions were 4.4 million metric tons, scope 2 emissions were 3.5 million metric tons2 and scope 3 emissions were 57.0 million metric tons.

We are part of a number of business networks that are supporting our journey to net zero.

Climate Business Network, we share best practices to drive collective ambition and scale action together.

Company Network has helped to identify opportunities to drive further progress toward net zero emissions.

In 2023, we are sustainable sourcing schemes to building our capabilities in life cycle quantify the impact of sustainable assessment (LCA) to further drive sourcing on emissions reduction.

The committee reports regularly to the full Board on these and other matters.

To learn more about our governance structure, see the Governance section.

For exclusions, please see the criteria statement in the Independent Accountant’s Review Report.

The following are examples of how we are working on climate initiatives with partners across our value chain.

One critical strategy for reducing emissions in our system is the increased use of renewable energy in our manufacturing processes.

Renewable electricity usage, which was third party assured for the first time in 2021, increased from 12% in 2021 to 21% in 2022.

Energy Project Pipeline in 2022, where we work closely with bottling partners to increase the number of renewable energy projects throughout our system.

As the number and scope of these projects expands, we will look for opportunities to collaborate and share best practices.

Given the size of our network of bottling partners, they are critically important in making progress toward our climate ambitions.

Our bottling partners have a major influence on emissions reductions based on what they buy, make and deliver for our shared customers and consumers.

In September 2022, Arca Continental committed to setting a science based target.

This program helped us to improve the way we calculate our Scope 1 2 emissions and to calculate our Scope 3 emissions for the first time.

Last November, we committed to setting a science based emissions target.

In total, more than 160 of our suppliers have set or committed to setting SBTi approved emissions targets.

Coolers have long been a key opportunity because approximately one third of our emissions comes from cold drink equipment and dispensing.

We continue to find new ways to collaborate we conducted in 2022, we published internal and support our suppliers to collectively guidance for coolers used across our value chain. reduce emissions.

We are also installing more intelligent suppliers with resources, tools and knowledge connected coolers that can transmit data to accelerate their decarbonization.

The company is directly sponsoring 56 of these helping reduce emissions.

The program is showing signs of success 10 suppliers that we sponsored, who successfully completed the program, have since set or committed to setting their own SBTi approved emissions targets.

This is an increase from 61% of coolers placed in 2016.

Our Risk Steering Committee oversees regular system wide risk assessments.

We regularly evaluate commodity specific risks and resilience associated with climate impacts on water and our supply chain.

This includes risks related to the effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change.

Our management team works to mitigate these risks through, among other things, business continuity planning, setting targets that drive efficiency and making investments to improve our performance and increase resilience.

In line with the launch of the SBTi’s Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) requirements, we are working to update our current science based target in line with this methodology and a more ambitious trajectory.

This new target would consider emissions from land use change in our supply chain as part of our overall GHG footprint and would consider carbon sequestration from land based projects we implement in our supply chain.

While we already work closely with suppliers to engage on water and sustainable agriculture, accounting for land use emissions would require an even closer partnership with our agricultural suppliers.

As we incorporate more work across the agricultural supply chain, this would also help us meet evolving climate risk and data disclosure requirements.

Gathering complete and accurate data is critical to identifying a path to achieving our science based target.

We are continuously improving the scope and detail of our data collection to ensure all significant sources of emissions across our value chain are included in our inventory.

We are updating our 2015 baseline data due to recent acquisitions.

Improving our data helps us prioritize projects and programs with the greatest impact, including more detail on renewable energy usage and more data from suppliers.

One area of focus has been to validate the accuracy and completeness of our renewable understand our supply chain, drive change and energy claims.

We have done this through more accurately track emissions reductions of assuring our claims to the GHG Protocol.

This specific suppliers and commodities in key areas.

Even deeper in our supply chain, work is underway to map and understand how land, water use and farming practices in our major agricultural sourcing regions both generate emissions and have the potential to reduce emissions.

Costa began its own work in 2022, launching a Climate Smart coffee project in partnership with the Rainforest Alliance.

This study is being used to inform the design of scalable climate mitigation interventions. work began in 2021 and continued through 2022.

Because approximately 85% of our total carbon emissions come from goods and services we buy, it is essential to engage with suppliers to accurately capture our full scope 3 emissions and ensure our suppliers join our decarbonization journey.

GHG emissions in our supply chain and information on supplier targets and initiatives to reduce emissions.

In 2022, 378 suppliers provided climate data to CDP out of 495 requested, a 12% increase from 2021.

Additionally, we are working to improve data accuracy in partnership with several major suppliers across ingredients and packaging, starting with sugar and aluminum, in order to develop supplier specific emissions factors for the commodities we procure.

The Ballina team’s learnings are being shared globally.

Our products and some of our packaging are made from a wide variety of agricultural ingredients which we source from around the world.

Our goal is to sustainably source all our ingredients over time.

We publicly report on our 12 global priority ingredients such as sugar, corn, fruit, coffee, tea and soybeans.

Sustainably sourcing our ingredients increases the resilience of our supply chain, helps to conserve nature and empowers producers and farm workers.

In practice, we encourage and support our ingredient suppliers to drive continuous improvement in sustainable farming practices, based on our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA).

SECTION SCOPE: In this section our Sustainable Agriculture work refers to actions by the company as well as our owned and independent bottling partners and our independent suppliers and partners.

Thriving farmers and farming communities are critically important for our supply chain.

Our ability to deliver quality products depends on having a sustainable and secure supply of agricultural ingredients.

LEADER: Supply volume is verified to company approved standards, with third party assurance aligned with the PSA.1 MOVER: Supply volume is sourced from farms using other agricultural farming standards, effectively identifying and addressing key sustainability issues and multinational companies to smallholder farmers. advancing sustainable practices.

IMPROVER: Supply volume is sourced communicate our expectations for environmental, from smallholder small scale producers participating in a support program to continuously improve their priority sustainability practices.

All of our agricultural based suppliers will demonstrate continuous improvement and will be categorized by The Coca Cola Company as either a Leader, Mover or Improver.

All of our global priority ingredient suppliers and their farm supply base will work toward achieving.

Leader status over time. social and economic performance to our agricultural suppliers at the farm level.

Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP), take a long term perspective and reflect the most recent science, our total beverage portfolio, and our increasingly diverse supply chain.

The PSA are designed to encourage continuous improvement in farming practices and lead to more ethical and sustainable sourcing.

The PSA framework for evaluating the compliance and performance of our supply farm base recognizes the on the ground realities in sustainable farming practices across a diversity of supply chains, farm structures and risk contexts.

Based on the PSA framework, suppliers are designated as either a Leader, Mover or Improver.

We are currently analyzing against the PSA framework the volume of the 12 global priority ingredients we procure.

This mapping, which we aim to complete by the end of 2025, will help determine how we engage with suppliers to drive continuous improvement.

We currently only report our Leader level volumes publicly.

Irrigated agriculture remains the largest user of water globally, accounting for 70% of water use worldwide,3 and has significant impacts on watershed health.

Agriculture is also one of the sectors most impacted by water stress and drought.

Water use within our agriculture supply chain accounts for the vast majority of the surface water and groundwater consumed in the production of our beverages.

Therefore, we are working with our suppliers to help promote the long term sustainability of water resources through the implementation of advanced water management practices at the farm level.

In addition, we are including our priority sourcing regions as part of our water replenishment programs.

Tekirda in T rkiye, which are priority sourcing regions for apples.

This partnership has guided us with a focus on the right solutions for young farmers in highly water stressed regions of T rkiye.

Doktar Co Founder and CEO tomato growing as farmers shift from a flood based irrigation system.

We estimate the project will replenish approximately 500 million liters of water per year.

The improvements in water use efficiency are expected to help reduce costs and increase profitability for the farmers.

Over the past year, we have worked closely with major water users.

Sensors will be installed to our suppliers to map our sourcing regions for our monitor climate and soil moisture conditions and global priority ingredients.

While we recognize satellite data (Sentinel 2 and PlanetScope) will that traceability is not always perfect, and our be used to calculate levels of evapotranspiration.

All of this data will be combined to provide understand sourcing regions for our global personalized irrigation programs for participating priority ingredients that are exposed to high or farmers and help to avoid excessive watering.

Drip irrigation infrastructure will be built on on engagement with suppliers in these priority selected sites, which helps to reduce water sourcing watersheds. use, and artificial reservoirs will be constructed to capture and hold rainwater to be used for irrigation purposes.

Regenerative agriculture is often referred to as a system of farming that focuses on positive outcomes that ensure the long term viability of land to sustain production by working with nature rather than against it.

A number of our completed and ongoing projects promote sustainable agriculture practices (e.g., use of cover crops) and contribute to positive outcomes, including reduced soil erosion and the buildup of organic matter.

We will use key learnings from these projects to inform the design of future projects and incorporate regenerative agriculture principles and practices.

Regenerative Agriculture Framework, we are supporting the development of an industry solution for measuring outcomes of regenerative agriculture practices at the farm level.

We are also actively involved with SAI Platform’s work on the Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA), a global verification framework and benchmark reference designed to accelerate sustainable agriculture.

The latest version, FSA 3.0, includes a self assessment questionnaire and a continuous improvement module that offers guidance for developing, implementing and monitoring performance improvement plans.

Smallholder farmers play an essential role in our supply chain.

Their livelihoods can be particularly vulnerable because they lack the resources and scale of commercial farmers.

We partner with a range of nonprofits, communities, industry organizations and other companies to support smallholder farmers in becoming more efficient and productive while improving water and climate footprints, managing soil health, maintaining crop protection, and respecting the human rights of their workforce and labor contractors.

Improver category of our PSA segmentation includes smallholders who may never be able to gain formal certification but who can, with appropriate support, contribute to more sustainable and regenerative agriculture while increasing their own incomes and resilience.

We are working with partners to support smallholder farmers in Brazil’s citrus sector, which is the largest in the world.

Many smallholder farmers in Brazil have struggled, particularly during the COVID 19 pandemic.

In 2022, the project directly assisted approximately 200 orange farms.

Agriculture in Egypt faces many challenges, including water scarcity, water pollution, desertification and land degradation.

Sustainable Development (ENID) implemented a project in the Qena governorate in Upper Egypt to demonstrate the value of using a greenhouse cultivation model to produce vegetables (e.g., eggplants and tomatoes), and the recycling and use of crop residues (materials left over after a crop harvest, e.g., stalks and stems) as compost on local farms.

Local farmers and laborers received equipment and training in these improved farming techniques.

The application of compost increased the soil moisture holding capacity on farmland and reduced the need for synthetic fertilizer.

It is estimated that composting reduced the use of water for irrigation by as much as 23%.

This decreased farming costs and generated an additional revenue stream for farmers.

The project also reduced the need for burning, which is the traditional way of disposing of agricultural waste.

The Coca Cola system and The Coca Cola Foundation have a long history of supporting projects that help improve efficiency of water use in irrigation, promote advanced water management, and drive improvement in sustainable farming practices.

Many projects have multiple locations, and many projects have the same description.

Many of these projects support agricultural ingredients that are not tied directly to our supply chain.

Many of these projects have been funded by The Coca Cola Foundation.

Mexico to demonstrate the positive outcomes of regenerative agriculture practices in the production of sugarcane.

Farming practices promoted include the use of biofertilizers made from microorganisms and compost.

In 2022, the project was one of the winners of the Bonsucro Impact Fund.

They steward our beloved beverage brands, fuel our innovation agenda, drive our sustainability priorities and programs, and create a multiplier effect in local communities through partnerships with governments, nonprofits, industry peers and other stakeholders.

We remain committed to caring for the people across our value chain who contribute to our success by respecting human rights across our operations and supply chain, empowering access to equal opportunities, supporting more sustainable agriculture practices, and giving back to communities through our philanthropic initiatives.

And we use our global scale as a force for progress and for good.

Rights in 2011, and we have strived to inspire and drive responsible business practices ever since, embedding respect for human rights across our business and value chain.

The foundation of our human rights program is our commitment to continuous improvement.

That’s why, in 2022, we engaged a human rights advisory firm to conduct a holistic and rigorous review of our human rights program to ensure that we remain at the vanguard of responsible business.

The process included extensive engagement with internal and external stakeholders to understand their primary human rights concerns and their expectations of an industry leading program.

We also conducted a global risk assessment to identify salient human rights risks1 across our global value chain and evaluate the strength of our governance to meet future challenges.

The aim of this extensive analysis was to establish a framework to drive meaningful human rights progress across our operations and value chain.

The result of our year long assessment is Real Impact, a new vision for the company’s human rights program.

Our mission is to take actions that lead to a better tomorrow.

We will take the lessons learned from existing programs and partnerships and seek to scale and adapt best practices across more geographies to deliver real impact to more people across our value chain.

We will work to drive progress across our company, our industry and beyond through rigorous analysis, creative partnerships and constant innovation to turn commitment into action.

The future of human rights at The Coca Cola Company is empowerment.

It is about respecting rights while working to drive progress.

We will seek to bring enduring changes to the lives of those we touch around the world.

To make our ambition concrete, Real Impact is grounded in three signature initiatives.

In a separate PDF document available soon, we index the contents of this report to several reporting frameworks and standards.

GRI provides a globally recognized framework for companies to measure and communicate their environmental, economic, social and governance performance.

We prepared this report in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option.

This is the twelfth consecutive year that these reporting principles have informed our reporting process, and we regularly assess our progress against these guidelines.

For all other indicators, the scope is identified in the referenced documents.

Beyond reporting on performance indicators required by the GRI, we report on additional indicators important to our broad range of stakeholders.

This report also meets the requirements of the UNGC Advanced Communication on Progress and aligns with the UNGPRF, which addresses reporting on human rights.

We review our reporting regularly and aim to be as responsive as possible to our stakeholders’ feedback.

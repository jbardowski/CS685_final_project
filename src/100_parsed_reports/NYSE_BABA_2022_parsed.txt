Company Introduction

Our mission: to make it easy to do business anywhere. Our founders started our company to champion 

small businesses, in the belief that the Internet would level the playing ﬁeld by enabling small enterprises 

to leverage innovation and technology to grow and compete more eﬀectively in domestic and global 

economies. We believe that concentrating on customer needs and solving their problems – whether those 

customers are consumers, merchants, or enterprises – ultimately will lead to the best outcome for our 

business. In the digital era, we are staying true to our mission by helping our customers and business 

partners harness the power of digital technology. We have developed an ecosystem powered by 

technology infrastructure that enables participants to create and share value on our platforms. Our 

decisions are guided by how they serve our mission over the long term, not by the pursuit of short-term 

gains.

Our vision: we aspire to be a good company that will last for 102 years. For a company that was 

founded in 1999, lasting for 102 years means we will have spanned three centuries. Our culture, business 

models, and systems are built to last, so that we can achieve sustainability in the long run. As we continue 

to expand our businesses, Alibaba has evolved into an ecosystem that is unique, energetic, and innovative.

Alibaba and Our Vision to Last 102 Years: 
Creating Value Beyond Commercial Outcomes

Letter from the Chairman and CEO

ESG not only provides a framework for tackling a series of global challenges, 
but is also the bridge to carry Alibaba to 102 years and beyond.

The extreme weather this summer is fueling global 

anxiety that the impact of climate change is not far 

removed in the future. Historical data shows that 

each decade since the 1960s has been hotter than 

the previous. Yet extreme weather is but one example 

of a world facing increasing uncertainty. The COVID 

pandemic is now in its third year, while geopolitical 

conﬂicts continue to intensify alongside emerging 

energy and food crises. The progress to date towards 

the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development 

Goals (SDGs), such as eradicating poverty, reducing 

inequality, and mitigating climate change, does not 

warrant optimism.

Alibaba's vision is to be a good company that will last 

for 102 years. We were founded in 1999, and 102 

years would give us a foothold across three centuries. 

This will require resilience to overcome major 

economic cycles and unexpected challenges. Our 

original vision is a testament to this long-term thinking, and shows our commitment to addressing issues faced by 

our communities and to creating value beyond only commercial outcomes. For us to last for 102 years in a healthy 

and sustainable fashion, we must manage our impact on the environment, our relationship with society at large, and 

our long-term corporate governance.

We believe the eﬀective implementation of ESG strategies should align with both global standards and China's 

practices. In recent years, China has announced several policies, such as carbon peaking and neutrality (Dual 

Carbon), common prosperity, rural revitalization, and educational equity, which are highly consistent with the 

action items advocated by the SDGs and oﬀer guidance for exploring value creation beyond commercial 

outcomes. We believe ESG designs and practices in China will evolve to incorporate unique local characteristics.

Our Action Plan

We believe in our responsibility and capability to be a driver of positive change more than ever. As a digital 

platform company, Alibaba's growth story is a history of innovation in the business applications of technology 

and the creation of new business formats with the many participants in our ecosystem. Today our digital 

platforms have brought together more than 1.3 billion consumers and tens of millions of merchants and other 

organizations. Not only are they business and innovation partners but also our companions on the journey of 

ESG exploration and practices. How to work with them to build a green and sustainable new business 

ecosystem and create value beyond commercial outcomes is a new expedition for all of us.

Of course, solving all these challenges and building a new business ecosystem is not something that can be 

done overnight, nor can any organization do it independently. It requires the trust and collaboration of all 

stakeholders, including policymakers, businesses, and the general public - all working together to discover 

innovative sustainable solutions. Based on our capabilities and priorities, our ESG plan focuses on the following 

seven strategies of action:

Restoring our green planet: Addressing major environmental issues such as climate change.

Supporting our people: Building a people-ﬁrst culture that oﬀers an equal, inclusive, and digniﬁed environment in which 

every employee can grow and develop.

Enabling a sustainable digital life: Leveraging the power of technology to bring a better and more responsible digital 

lifestyle for everyone.

The design of our ESG strategy is critical to the realization of this vision. ESG not only oﬀers businesses an action 

Fueling small businesses: Creating more growth opportunities for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and 

framework to address universal risks and challenges but is also increasingly important as a global standard for 

entrepreneurs through technology and business innovations.

evaluating a good company. Last year, we formally announced that ESG would become a core pillar of Alibaba’s 

strategies. 

Enhancing community inclusion and resilience:  Sharing dividends of development with disadvantaged groups and 

underserved regions, and thus building more inclusive and resilient communities.

Alibaba has been in existence for 23 years, and we believe ESG is a good yardstick for measuring value, responsibility, 

Facilitating  participatory  philanthropy:  Fostering  a  culture  of  participatory  philanthropy  by  integrating  community 

and risk in the 79 years ahead and beyond. It helps us develop a practical, clear, and persistent action plan with 

high-quality and transparent metrics for continuous self-evaluation and improvement. We will share our progress 

through two reports: our Annual Report on the health of our business, and the ESG report on our progress in 

sustainability and the associated value we create.

resources with creative platform innovations.

Building  corporate  and  social  trust:  Building  corporate  trust  by  establishing  an  eﬀective,  transparent,  and  sound 

governance system; building social trust with ethical technology and protecting user privacy and data security.

Our Progress in Action

Over the past year, I have spent a lot of time working closely with our teams on Alibaba's ESG strategies and 

with compliance, transparency, and accountability. At the beginning of this month, we announced two 

action plan, which has been my top priority. To guide our strategy and execution, we are building a three-tier 

new independent directors, bringing the total number of independent directors on our board to seven 

governance structure consisting of the sustainability committee at the board level, the sustainability steering 

out of twelve, or more than 50 percent, and the number of female board members to three. We will 

committee (SSC) for management oversight, and the ESG working group.

continue to enhance the independence and excellence of our board.

We are proud that every bit of our progress in ESG has been inextricably connected with the economic and 

social growth of people's daily lives. We are actively exploring how to use technology to better serve our ESG 

objectives, how to better integrate ESG into our business design, and how to promote public welfare more 

eﬀectively and sustainably in various social topics, such as ﬁghting pandemics and natural disasters or 

supporting longer-term endeavors including common prosperity, rural development, and Chinese cultural 

preservation. Our eﬀorts in addressing these topics help us develop a deeper understanding of our 

relationship with our times and the society we are in.

In December 2021, we released our Carbon Neutrality Action Report and made some important commitments. 

These commitments will continue to impact generations of Alibaba employees, or "Aliren." We know that 

Conclusion

Despite the many challenges ahead, we are hopeful. The world is full of uncertainties and we are at a 

critical juncture for a new phase in sustainable development. Under these circumstances, ESG is not 

just the right choice but also an opportunity to shape the future. We will publish this ESG report 

annually to share periodic updates on our goals, actions, and progress. We believe digitalization can 

not only bring connectivity and synergy, but also uniquely drive green transformation and sustainable 

change will only come with ongoing eﬀorts across generations. By now, carbon reduction is a priority across 

development.

our organization. We have pioneered methodologies for measuring "Scope 3+" emissions reduction with 

leading institutions and started industry collaborations with consumer companies on decarbonization-friendly 

actions. We have also recently rolled out a carbon ledger platform to make it easier for users across Alibaba’s 

ecosystem to participate in eco-friendly actions. As a general principle, we strive to make low-carbon eﬀorts 

go hand-in-hand with long-term development. Meanwhile, we have started to incorporate broader 

environmental commitments into future planning, including on water, natural resources, and biodiversity.

We also believe that the boundaries of social responsibility should be broader. To begin with, we are 

committed to creating an equal, inclusive, and digniﬁed working environment for our employees, providing 

them with growth opportunities as well as fair and reasonable compensation and beneﬁts. We are leveraging 

technology to support the high-quality development of small businesses and the creation of inclusive and 

ﬂexible employment opportunities at scale while enabling more consumers to access a sustainable lifestyle. 

We are contributing to building a digital rural economy and improving community resilience to combat 

pandemics and natural disasters. We are promoting a culture of participatory philanthropy, which means 

charitable actions and social impact eﬀorts can be inﬂuential in addressing sustainable development 

challenges beyond business goals.

We are also continuing to pursue corporate governance excellence and earn the long-term trust of consumers, 

customers, and other stakeholders. We are leveraging industry-leading technologies and capabilities to help 

build a trust system for digital business, including secure protection of user privacy and data security. We are 

building a digitalized and comprehensive risk management system and an eﬀective governance mechanism 

We hope the implementation of our ESG strategy will make Alibaba a better company. We also hope to 

work together with everyone towards a better, fairer, and more sustainable future!

Global challenges and the 
roles of technology and business

The world collectively faces a host of issues that threaten our society's future, with the most pressing twin 

challenges being environmental degradation and socioeconomic inequality. These risks are urgent and of 

a magnitude that puts them beyond the capacity of any singular institution or even country to address.

Understanding the scale and complexity of these challenges, the global community is coming together 

and engaging in concerted eﬀorts. These initiatives include the United Nations (UN) 17 Sustainable 

ESG at Alibaba's core

For Alibaba, ESG is the bridge to carry us into a long-term and sustainable future. We are, after all, a 

company born with social responsibility in our DNA. That begins with our mission to "make it easy to do 

business anywhere." Our platforms have helped over ten million small businesses to thrive and over a 

billion consumers to enjoy better lives. To continue to make such contributions, Alibaba must do all it 

can to mitigate key societal challenges, for the long-term sustainability of ourselves, our partners, and 

our communities at large.

On our 20th anniversary in 2019, we led discussions to propose China's ﬁrst Sustainable Business Action

Development Goals (SDGs), some of China's key development policy initiatives (carbon neutrality, common 

Initiative, recommending that our business partners and industry peers, together with us, should:

prosperity, and rural revitalization), and the budding corporate ESG movement.  

As a technology-driven platform company in this era, Alibaba should shoulder the responsibility to help 

mitigate these challenges. Digitalization has brought unprecedented connectivity and collaboration,

necessary governance structures;

Practice sustainable development in business activities and be transparent in ESG disclosure;

across the world. We must bring to bear the full force of digital innovation, while also ensuring that every 

person and community that we serve can fully enjoy its beneﬁts.

In our view, there are three pillars - prioritizing social responsibility, leveraging the strength of technology, 

and engaging the stakeholder ecosystem - that serve as indispensable building blocks for systematic, 

scalable, and collaborative solutions to sustainability challenges. Businesses touch upon all three pillars 

and should help gather these forces to identify solutions that align with the public interest. Digital 

platforms are especially well positioned to link the three building blocks to create ecosystems, both for 

business and beyond, that are technology-powered and socially responsible. 

Strengthen cooperation with all stakeholders to jointly promote sustainable development;

Commit to delivering on long-term sustainable development objectives to ensure a better future for

By December 2021, we had codiﬁed our recommendations into a robust system, declaring ESG as one 

of Alibaba's top priorities in our business strategies and future growth. On that basis, we are              

championing responsible technology, and committing to the inseparable link between our own future 

and a sustainable future for all.

Our approach: 
ﬁve strategic design steps

In designing our ESG strategy based on the three pillars - social responsibility, technological strength, and 

multiple stakeholder engagement - we have developed a systematic ﬁve-step approach to position, 

integrate, coordinate, amplify, and complement our ESG goals.

Positioning and targeting: Through extensive communication with relevant stakeholders such as 

consumers, employees, investors, governments, partners, and communities, and considering the most 

pressing societal challenges and Alibaba’s own characteristics and capabilities, we have identiﬁed the 

issues of greatest priority. We have further clariﬁed our strategic positioning with ESG as central to our 

core strategy, and we are committed to being a technology company that promotes human well-being 

and protects the planet, so that people and nature can develop in a sustainable way.

Integrating ESG into business design: Only by establishing social responsibility as a core element of 

business design, combined with technological and business innovations, can sustainability truly become 

the engine of enterprise development. This means that ESG goals must be integrated into strategic 

planning, business positioning, and operations.

Promoting coordinated transformation of the related business ecosystem: With social responsibility 

as our strategic goal, we should innovate and reform our system from the inside out and across the 

value chain, together with suppliers, NGOs, and ecosystem partners.

Alibaba's ESG strategy design: 
a seven-petal ﬂower

By conducting materiality assessments in extensive exchanges with stakeholder groups, we have 

identiﬁed 22 ESG material issues at Alibaba (for details, see Appendix 4), which we organize into 

seven action dimensions of our long-term ESG plan. This is represented in our "Alibaba 

seven-petal ESG ﬂower."  The seven strategy goals are closely aligned with the UN’s 17 SDGs 

and China’s key development policy initiatives.

necessary to restore our green planet while simultaneously providing consumers with a better, sustainable digital life and providing a platform for the development of

everyone's participation in tackling our social challenges.

Executive Summary

/ 018

A summary of our actions in
the seven strategy dimensions

I. Restoring Our Green Planet
To help mitigate climate change, the central issue of the present environmental crisis, we have made ambitious 

carbon pledges that cover our operations (Scopes 1 and 2), our value chain (Scope 3), and our platform 

ecosystem (Scope 3+). We have been proactive in pioneering the concept of "Scope 3+" to reﬂect a platform 

operator's potential and responsibility to go above and beyond its own carbon emissions. In the long run, we are 

committed to the Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi) that seeks to limit the average global temperature increase to 

1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050.

We are fully committed to our pledges and will work relentlessly to speed up our carbon transition in the following 

directions.

Reducing operational and value chain carbon
emissions (Scopes 1, 2, and 3)

Tackling broader environmental
problems

We strive to reach operational carbon neutrality via substitution 

Beyond carbon emissions, we have also 

with greener materials and clean energy, digital optimization, 

developed programs and targets for tackling 

and recycling. We apply these procedures to our most 

other environmental challenges, such as

II. Supporting Our People
Alibaba is a global technology company with diverse and talented employees working in oﬃces across 

carbon-relevant operations, including our work environments, 

preserving biodiversity, reducing waste, and 

27 countries and regions. None of our goals can be achieved without them. We strive to be a company 

retail stores, cloud computing, and logistics. We actively work 

conserving water.

that people love to work for, and where they can become better versions of themselves.

with our value chain partners, expanding our sustainable 

procurement program to reduce Scope 3 emissions. In the 

Alibaba Supplier ESG Code of Conduct, we encourage our 

suppliers to establish their own emission reduction plans. We've 

pioneered more environmentally conscious product categories, 

such as China’s ﬁrst large-scale batch of certiﬁed low-carbon 

organic agricultural products. 

Partnering for platform decarbonization (Scope 3+)

With professional institutions, we jointly published Scope 3+ 

Emissions Reduction: A New Methodology for Corporate 

Climate Actions Beyond Value Chains. Under its guidance, we 

developed a digital carbon reduction measurement system, 

and launched our carbon ledger platform covering multiple 

apps, already helping over 20 million users practice carbon 

reduction. We also launched the "Decarbonization-friendly 

Action" program in concert with many leading brands.

To accomplish this, we commit to four actions:

Build an equal, digniﬁed, inclusive, and diverse workplace

 We value having a diverse set of people, talents, roles, views, and cultures at Alibaba. We have always 

had a deep reservoir of female leadership. Women comprise 39% of leaders in our senior management 

team, and our workforce is evenly split by gender. We eschew hierarchy to promote candid and open 

communication at all levels, including regular employee chats with our Chairman and CEO, Daniel Zhang.

Provide fair and competitive compensation, and "beneﬁts with warmth" 

We retain and advance motivated and talented people with competitive compensation, including 

salary, bonus, and equity incentive awards. Our beneﬁts package goes above and beyond the average 

and extends to the families of employees.

Provide rich learning and working opportunities that lead to personal growth

We run a large internal training and development program. In FY2022, the average training time per 

employee reached 49 hours. We also actively promote internal job mobility, with 7,707 positions ﬁlled 

internally in FY2022, making Alibaba itself a dynamic talent market.

Promote people's health and vitality

We put signiﬁcant eﬀort into crafting vibrant, healthy workplaces with a happy work culture. We take

III. Enabling a Sustainable Digital Life

IV. Fueling Small Businesses

We are committed to helping consumers achieve better lives in increasingly responsible and sustainable ways. 

Unlike other recent industrial revolutions, this is an era in which small players can be competitive. We 

We promote sustainable consumption with the following four characteristics:

hope that the stakeholder ecosystem we have built with our partners can support the sustained growth 

of small businesses. For that we act in four directions:

Diverse consumption

Trustworthy consumption

A better life requires diverse products and services. 

We are dedicated to high standards for the 

We run the world's largest consumer market with 

billions of SKUs on oﬀer, allowing consumers to 

access a diverse array of products with diﬀerent 

functions, brands, price levels, and delivery speeds. 

Our platforms provide transparent price comparison 

tools that help consumers ﬁnd the best value for 

their money.

Inclusive consumption

We continually extend our services to remote and 

less aﬄuent regions: more than 70% of new users 

in China last year came from relatively 

less-developed regions. We make eﬀorts to ensure 

digital tools are accessible to traditionally 

genuineness, safety, and quality of goods and services 

on our platform. We are also making consumer privacy 

protection a top priority. We communicate to our users 

the scope of data collection with transparency, require 

user authorization to do so, and facilitate opting out of 

data-based recommendations at any time. By Aug 15, 

2022, our virtual phone number feature had covered 

over 500 million active consumers on Taobao.

Responsible consumption

We foster responsible consumption on our platforms 

by banning dangerous and harmful products, 

promoting a green marketplace of sustainable goods, 

underserved groups, such as senior citizens and 

and encouraging sustainable consumption habits. By 

people with disabilities. In FY2022, 305,000 

the end of FY2022, the Cainiao box recycling program 

visually-impaired users were active on Taobao.

now operates in 315 cities in China.

Building responsible technologies

Enabling inclusive employment

In FY2022, we invested a record of over RMB120 

We have created opportunities for over ten 

billion in technology-related areas. We believe 

million MSMEs on our e-commerce platforms, 

responsible technology should be eﬃcient, green, 

and an estimated 60 million jobs. We have also 

advanced, inclusive, and open. For many years we

while retaining their ﬂexibility and vitality. 

with state-of-the-art digital technologies and 

solutions that make their work more eﬃcient, less

V. Enhancing Community Inclusion and Resilience

VI. Facilitating Participatory Philanthropy

The urban-rural socioeconomic divide is the largest inequality challenge in China, a situation paralleled 
around the world. At the same time, economic development is not sustainable if society, especially 
disadvantaged groups within it, sees disasters and crises wiping out their hard-earned progress. We strive to 
enhance the inclusion and resilience of communities by tackling the following two intertwined problems:

Facilitate rural digitalization for a more inclusive economy

First, we continue to spur economic development by building the e-commerce market into rural areas. In 2019, 
Alibaba was the ﬁrst technology company to receive the National Poverty Alleviation Organization Innovation 
Award in China. In 2021, we helped sell RMB128.1 billion of products from 832 counties previously categorized 
as impoverished under China’s national standards, and Alibaba was awarded as a National Exemplary Orga-
nization in Poverty Alleviation. Second, we help revitalize rural value chains by bringing much-needed business 
infrastructure, production technologies, and even marketing and branding skills to rural areas. Third, we 
dispatch experienced employees as "rural commissioners" and "rural technology oﬃcers" to help craft local 
development solutions. At the same time, we run programs that promote digital education, cultivate rural 
talent, help to create local jobs, and improve schools and medical facilities.

Support the strengthening of community resilience

We build our own resilience capabilities to support the operation of the business ecosystem and better respond 
to society's needs during crises. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, we have leveraged our digital capabilities, 
including in operations, market access, and logistics to support society. These eﬀorts include the procurement 
and donation of medical supplies and necessities, and the use of our technological capacity to tackle COVID-19. 
We share technologies to improve disaster forecasts, coordination, and recovery, seeking to promote broader 
societal resilience. DAMO Academy’s Medical AI Team received the award "National Exemplary Organization for 
Pandemic Response in Science and Technology" from China's Ministry of Science and Technology. Meanwhile, 
our logistics arm Cainiao worked with partners to distribute over 260 million pieces of medical supplies to over 
150 countries, including cold-chain deliveries of life-saving vaccines to 11 developing countries. Cainiao was 
awarded the Silver Stevie Award for "Most Valuable Enterprise Response" for global COVID-19 eﬀorts.

Our approach to philanthropy is centered on the notion that public service should be widely participatory. 
We apply this principle in four key ways.

We start with our employees in promoting participatory and multi-layered philanthropy 

Our "Three Hours for a Better World" asks all employees to give at least three hours to a cause annually. 

In 2022, DAMO Academy created a digital sign-language interpreter to help the hearing-impaired better 

navigate the world. We support a unique employee-led and elected Alibaba Philanthropy Committee.

We draw upon our expertise in technology to directly tackle social issues: Our engineers and 
other employees gave their time to build and run the "Reunion System" to help locate missing children. 

Over the past 6 years, the system has sent alerts for 5,038 missing children and assisted in the recovery 

of 4,960 of them. In the latest program year alone, we assisted in the recovery of 253 children. 

We deploy our resources to be a force multiplier and a tool to help those already doing good
We launched Green Code, a volunteer tech service platform connecting over 330 organizations and 6,000 

programmers. Our "XIN 100" philanthropic support program aims to provide 100 projects with resources 

and skills to enhance their work.

We leverage our platforms to involve everyone in philanthropy: In FY2022, "Goods for Good" 
engaged over 2.2 million merchants and 500 million consumers in channeling shopping proceeds to 

charitable projects in line with our social purpose. In recent years, we rolled out "Three Hours for a Better 

World" to the public, logging over 600 million volunteer sessions.

VII. Building Trust
Becoming a company that earns long-term corporate and social trust from all its stakeholders is          
imperative if we are to fulﬁll our social responsibility. 

     To earn corporate trust, we have established a transparent and robust system of governance across 
all levels of the organization. Alibaba beneﬁts from having a dynamic and diverse board of directors as 
well as a unique partnership system that looks out for the company's mission, vision, and values. In 
2021, we set up a three-tier sustainability governance structure to support our ESG actions. We maintain 
rigorous risk management systems that give us multiple lines of defense to spot and rectify risks. We 
maintain high standards of business conduct for all of our managers, employees, and partners.

     To earn social trust, we created a Science and Technology Ethics Governance Committee this year to 
ensure our technologies will always be developed and used for ethical purposes. We strive to be a 
leader in user data privacy and security protection, which are foundational to our services. In 2015 
Alibaba Cloud launched China's ﬁrst Data Protection Initiative to protect our business customers with 
three principles: "you own your data; you manage your data; your data is protected."  The six pillars of 
Alibaba Cloud's security protection, including anti-DDoS, web application ﬁrewall, cloud security center, 
cloud ﬁrewall, business risk control, and conﬁdential computing, have all received recognition from 
leading global authorities.

To help restore our planet and to sustain our own business, Alibaba has integrated climate risk management 

into our business strategy and risk management system. In line with the recommendations of the Task Force 

on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), we work to identify potential risks and opportunities associated 

with climate change, and improve our capabilities to manage those risks.

The sustainability committee of Alibaba's board of

ESG strategy and implementation, including climate 
risk management and carbon neutrality goals. The 
sustainability steering committee, led by the board's 
sustainability committee, works with the ESG working 
group to plan and implement our ESG strategy. 

The Alibaba Group Risk Management Committee is 
responsible for reviewing the relevant risk assessments 
and making corresponding institutional and management 
arrangements separately. The Risk Management 
Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, continues to 
incorporate climate risks into the company's overall risk 
assessment and management system. 

Strategy

Metrics and targets

We have analyzed the physical and transition risks 
of climate change in our businesses and identified 
strategies for addressing risks, as well as potential 
opportunities. Our goal for carbon neutrality adheres 
to the following general principles: direct carbon 
reduction takes precedence over carbon removal, 
and carbon removal takes precedence over offsets. 
This prioritization approach offers the fastest and 
most effective path to reducing the concentration of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) in the atmosphere, and is also 
consistent with the Paris Agreement goals of limiting 
the global temperature rise to 1.5 ° C.

We have made a three-fold emission reduction 
pledge covering our own operations, value chain, 
and platform ecosystem. In addition, Alibaba has 
committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). 

To guide our future actions, aligned with the 
recommendations of the TCFD, we have considered 
a range of scenarios, including those well below and 
above a 2° C average global temperature change, 
to better understand the potential impact of climate 
change on Alibaba's businesses, communities, and 
stakeholders.

Green the value chain (Scope 3): By 2030, we will collaborate with our upstream and downstream value 

chain partners to cut emission intensity by 50% from the base year of 2020. Alibaba Cloud will achieve 

Scope 3 carbon neutrality during the same period.

Enable a low-carbon circular digital ecosystem (Scope 3+): Beyond our own operations and direct 

value chains, we pledge to leverage our digital platforms to encourage even broader participation by 

stakeholders that can be reached by our efforts. By 2035, we will facilitate 1.5 gigatons of GHG emission 

reduction over 15 years across Alibaba's digital ecosystem.

As projected in Alibaba's Carbon Neutrality Action Report, our carbon emissions have not yet peaked and are 

likely to continue rising with business development in the short term. This growth mainly derives from (a) the 

steady expansion of our core business, such as in cloud computing, globalization, and offline retail stores 

(b) developments to improve our fulfillment capabilities and user experiences, such as expansion of delivery

areas, and (c) new businesses serving emerging customer needs that integrate both offline and online services.

These business activities will require higher power consumption (Scope 2) and more procurement from our 

supply chain (Scope 3), contributing to an increase in new carbon emissions. We recognize that Alibaba's 

position as a company that integrates technology, retail, and logistics businesses, with extensive online and 

offline operations, means that our decarbonization plans must consider the complex interaction of multiple 

sectors. At the same time, this also creates enormous opportunities for cross-sector innovations in our carbon 

reduction efforts.

¹ The scope of this inventory is the identified measurable significant source categories in Scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions within Alibaba's organizational 
and reporting boundaries in FY2022 under the principle of operational control. The GHG categories covered in this inventory include carbon dioxide (CO2), 
methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). As a result of

Water conservation

We have adopted water-saving faucets in all RT-Mart stores, for an expected 

net saving of about 100,000 tons of water consumption annually. Since 2007, 

we have built a wastewater storage and circulation system, reducing water 

consumption by about 1,000 tons per store every year, for a total of 490,000 

tons of water annually. Building on these practices, we have also set a target 

at RT-Mart to decrease average water use by 3% per store in 2025 compared to 

the base year 2020.

Kunshan RT-Mart Commercial Plaza sustainable design

Sun Art applied sustainable designs at the Kunshan RT-Mart Plaza. Both green building standards and "sponge 

city" water efficiency principles were followed. In addition, we adjusted the building envelope to reduce energy 

consumption and increase rainwater recycling. During construction, Sun Art adopted green construction policies 

to control carbon emissions throughout the life cycle of the project.

Resource and waste management

Our stores have implemented resource and waste management in a variety of ways：

Reduce food waste in retail stores: Sun Art Retail has continued to improve its systems to cut food 

waste across the entire life cycle including procurement, storage, processing, and sales. In FY2022, our 

kitchen waste was reduced by 4%.

Reduce material usage: We have adopted digital receipts, label printing, and express order printing 

to save tens of millions of articles of paper. We encourage merchants to use original boxes for delivery 

and combine packages through our smart management systems.

Packaging upgrade: Sun Art and Freshippo are providing consumers with recycled bags. Freshippo 

retail locations have entirely transitioned from plastic to degradable plastic, paper, and recyclable non-

woven bags, while Sun Art has introduced degradable plastic bags across all stores.

Energy efficiency

Using a variety of energy-saving strategies, such as artificial 

intelligence (AI)-powered management algorithms and water-cooling 

techniques, the average power usage effectiveness (PUE) for our self-

operated data centers in FY2022 was as low as 1.247, a leading level 

in Asia. This represents a win for our business, our clients, and the 

environment. Looking forward, we aim to keep the annual PUE of self-

owned data centers below 1.3.

the distribution link of the system by 66% and improves the efficiency by more than 3% to 97.5% compared 

with the traditional method. The innovative equipment has been shortlisted for the 2021 National 

Industrial Energy-Saving Technology Recommendation Catalog.

Low-carbon and circular cloud 

Low-carbon cloud services

For the tens of millions of businesses that rely on our 

platforms, Alibaba's cloud services provide the digital 

backbone on which the ongoing green transformation 

can be built. According to the Carbon Trust research 

report, Alibaba Cloud's Carbon Benefits, cloud 

customers in China can avoid 85.5% of their computing 

emissions by moving to Alibaba Cloud from on-premise 

equivalents, largely contributed by the efficiency of our 

own internet data centers (IDC). ⁵

We are innovating continuously to build a "green 

cloud" as set out in our carbon neutrality commitment, 

focusing on increased energy efficiency, renewable 

electricity use, and recycling of energy and resources.

Water conservation

We take advantage of natural air cooling to preserve water. In our 

Zhangbei Wulan center, with an average outside temperature of only 4°C, 

we utilize air handling unit (AHU) technology and air cooler systems,  

reducing the water usage effectiveness (WUE) value to as low as 0.45L/

kWh, saving more than 80% compared to traditional cooling tower 

schemes.6 Alibaba Cloud has also established a WUE management plan 

to refine the management of water consumption in various divisions. In 

FY2022, our reclaimed water recovery reached 11,899 tons and reclaimed 

water procurement amounted to 359,252 tons.

The  Zhangbei  Miaotan  Data  Center  implemented  a  project  to 

introduce  a  reverse  osmosis  (RO)  sewage  system  for  water 

treatment, increasing the recycling and utilization of sewage water. 

The water treatment project was able to reduce sewage discharge 

of  the  server  building  by  35%  and  reduce  supplementary  water 

consumption by 26%. Between its launch in June 2021 and March 31, 

2022, the project had already recovered 11,899 tons of water. 

Waste management

We have unified standards for solid waste management from our server equipment and require our 

suppliers to properly treat solid waste and hazardous waste (mainly lead-acid batteries, destroyed hard 

disks, etc.) in strict compliance with these standards and with regulations.

6 Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) is a parameter in the data center that analyzes how efficiently water is being utilized and is the ratio of the 
annual water usage of data centers to the energy consumption of IT equipment.

Using renewable electricity

We are committed to powering our cloud services with 100% 

clean energy worldwide by no later than 2030. To this end, we 

are already leading China's technology companies in clean 

energy transaction volume and usage. BloombergNEF rated 

Alibaba Cloud first in renewable energy procurement in 2021 with 

a transaction volume of 269 GWh. In FY2022, Alibaba Cloud's own 

data centers reduced around 534,000 MtCO2e (metric tons of CO2 

equivalent) of emissions by purchasing clean energy and natural 

gas, with clean energy accounting for 21.6% of its total electricity 

consumption.

heat the adjacent office park and provide municipal heat. The heating load 

of the first phase of the waste heat utilization project is 21MW, which by 

the end of next year will reduce carbon emissions by 32,000 tons annually. 

We also extend the life of our hardware. In FY2022, Alibaba refurbished 

50,000 servers to extend the use cycle. Furthermore, we have extended the 

maintenance of all servers to five years, dismantled scrapped servers, and 

recycled spare parts, leading to the extension of the warranty of 20 million 

cores of servers in 2021.

The success of our business depends on a vast logistics network that ties together our facilities, stores, ecosystem 

partners, and consumers. Efforts to make that network smarter and greener are an indispensable part of building a 

low-carbon circular ecosystem. Cainiao was one of the first companies in China's logistics industry to launch a green 

initiative. We continue to exert efforts in the four directions of green transportation, green transfer, green packaging, 

and green recycling, forming a start-to-finish green logistics solution from order generation to parcel delivery.

Green packaging

With help from our business partners and consumers, 

we can reduce wasteful packaging through optimization, 

substitution, and recycling. We are promoting delivery using 

original manufacturer boxes. In FY2022, Cainiao's original 

box shipping exceeded 700 million pieces. Intelligent 

carton cutting, packaging 

algorithms, and AI can further 

optimize carton models and 

reduce our use of materials 

by an average of 15%. We 

are also experimenting with 

new materials to replace 

plastics. In Southeast Asia, 

Lazada is replacing non-

700 million+
original box shipping

recyclable materials with FSC-certified packaging. To involve 

our customers in these efforts, we have launched a Cainiao 

box recycling program to facilitate their recycling of cartons at 

many Cainiao stations.

Green transport

Transport is one of the main sources of carbon emissions, so 

Cainiao is targeting electrifying land transport and increasing 

low-carbon air transport in order to reduce its GHG footprint. 

We plan to replace all short-haul logistics vehicles with electric 

vehicles by 2030. In Indonesia, along with our partner, Lazada 

Logistics launched the Blue Vehicle, an environmentally-

friendly delivery vehicle which will allow Lazada to transition 

primarily to electric vehicles in Jakarta. In Vietnam, Lazada is 

choosing electric bikes to provide delivery services. Alibaba 

DAMO Academy and Cainiao have also fielded the Xiaomanlv 

("little donkey"), an Alibaba L4 autonomous driving vehicle, 

to facilitate last-mile unmanned deliveries in communities 

and campuses. Since its launch through March 31, 2022, it has

At Alibaba, we are well positioned to support the consumer transition to more sustainable consumption, and facilitate 

enterprises, especially MSMEs, in realizing high-quality development while minimizing their ecological footprint.

In December 2021, we pioneered the concept of "Scope 3+" to measure GHG emissions beyond a firm's own 

Scopes 1, 2, and 3 definitions. We have done so in an attempt to take on more responsibility for the emissions 

generated by a wider range of participants in the platform ecosystem. 

Given the innovative nature of Scope 3+, we are committed to working with leading institutions and professionals 

to establish a solid scientific foundation in determining the definition, principles, and measurement 

methodologies of Scope 3+, and to proactively share our research and methodologies.

We worked with renowned research institutions and 

professionals to expand the theoretical and methodological 

frontiers of scientific carbon measurement. In August 

2022, with China Environmental United Certification Center 

(CEC), we jointly published Scope 3+ Emissions Reduction: 

A New Methodology for Corporate Climate Actions Beyond 

Value Chains, with expert contributions from the Carbon 

Trust. In this report we proposed two key principles of 

decarbonization in Scope 3+. 

The essential logic of carbon reduction measurement is 

to verify the difference in emissions when an entity takes 

carbon reduction actions compared to the benchmark 

scenario without such actions. With this basis, we can 

further divide the measurement of Scope 3+ emissions 

reductions into two categories depending on the role of the 

enterprise in the carbon reduction action.

Two categories of 
decarbonization in Scope 3+ 

Principles for identifying Scope 
3+ emission reduction projects

Enabled carbon abatement 

Based on the two categories, we then establish the 

Solutions (i.e., products or services) provided by 

enterprises that enable the same function to be 

performed with significantly less GHG emissions. 

Enablement reduces emissions compared to the 

baseline 'business-as-usual' (BAU) scenario.

Engaged carbon abatement

Scope 3+ emission reduction through engagement 

means that a company spurs its stakeholders 

(e.g., businesses and consumers) to reduce GHG 

emissions that are not covered in the company's 

own Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. 

The Scope 3+ engagement category highlights the 

idea that a platform company can play a prominent 

role in climate change mitigation by proactively 

either enabling or engaging with stakeholders to 

unlock their potential in reducing emissions.

principles for identifying Scope 3+ emission reduction 

projects.

  Such projects must offer emission reduction 

effects.

  The emission reductions need to be measurable, 

explainable, and verifiable in accordance with 

the methodologies developed by professional 

organizations.

We have actively collaborated with industry-leading 

certification organizations, such as the China Institute 

of Standardization, the China Environmental United 

Certification Center, China Beijing Environmental 

Exchange, and others, on principles and specific 

calculation methodologies for Scope 3+ to ensure its 

reliability and wide applicability, and we seek more 

partners in this effort.

Scope 3+ actions

Consumer carbon reduction

We launched the "Carbon88" carbon ledger platform in 2022, 

covering some of Alibaba's most-used apps. By July 2022, over 

20 million users had actively participated in carbon reduction 

through a greener consumption style. The system is built on 

top of our OPEN C+ engine. Currently, the platform covers 

more than 70 scenarios. All methods and scenarios have been 

reviewed and approved by our committee of independent, 

external experts.

After consumers choose to opt-in, the Carbon88 platform 

collects data only for the purpose of calculating carbon 

emissions. The process is designed to fully comply with 

our principles to safeguard consumer privacy and security: 

minimal data collection for specific purposes, maximum user 

awareness and choices, and the best data security protection.

In the future, we aim to promote the carbon ledger platform to help 

more of our partners better measure and practice carbon reduction.

In March 2022, Taobao introduced a new func-
tion for consumers to measure their carbon 
reduction when buying certiﬁed "Energy-Saving 
and Carbon Reducing" home appliances. By June 
30, 2022, over 4,000 merchants had listed 
430,000 certiﬁed home appliances. During the 
6.18 Shopping Festival in 2022, the potential 
carbon reduction from energy eﬃcient consumer 
products sold on Taobao and Tmall was estimat-
ed to be around 153,000 tons.

Starting April 20, 2022, Ele.me users were able to 
measure their potential carbon reduction from 
choosing the "cutlery free”option when ordering 
takeout. Since then, more than 13 million users 
have enabled this option in their orders.

Guidance on carbon reduction options in various apps makes it easy for 
consumers to choose low-carbon actions in everyday life. 

The OPEN C+ consumer carbon reduction computation engine

provides measurement services for Carbon88
and will open to the public in the future.

Idle Fish launched the carbon credit project 
at the end of January 2022, where users can 
measure potential carbon reduction when 
buying and selling second-hand goods. 

Amap and the Beijing Transportation 
Commission jointly developed the "Beijing

a total of 24,500 tons of avoided emissions 
accumulated by users were successfully 
traded in the carbon markets.

Partnership for scaling up consumer carbon reduction

Energy Expert Platform to help green other organizations

In July 2022, Alibaba jointly launched the "Decarbonization-friendly Action" program with 19 brands in an effort 

to increase carbon reduction actions in the consumer goods industry and provide incentives for consumers to 

develop decarbonization habits. Our group set three collective targets: 

  Promote more low-carbon goods, from design to production, together with science-based 

    measurements.    

    Integrate the supply chain with low-carbon packaging and logistics.

    Enhance consumer awareness and familiarity with green goods through low-carbon marketing. 

Alibaba Cloud launched the "Energy Expert" platform to 

help enterprises reduce emissions and increase efficiency. 

Energy Expert can identify energy inefficiencies and 

losses and optimize energy use such as in HVAC (Heating, 

Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems through smart 

algorithms. It also provides suggestions to improve 

efficiency. As of FY2022, nearly 1,700 companies had 

already begun to use the Energy Expert platform.

Cracking down on the illegal wildlife trade on our platforms

Globally, the illegal trade of wildlife is among the biggest threats to biodiversity. We understand our 

responsibility as the world's largest e-commerce market and we strictly monitor and take action to prevent the 

illegal wildlife trade. 

We carry out such efforts in three areas:

 Discovering and identifying illegal wildlife trading on platforms

 Cooperating with law enforcement agencies when violations are found

 Carrying out user awareness programs and encouraging users to report and prevent illegal activities

We have banned the sale of more than 30,000 species of wild animals and plants on our platforms, covering 

species on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the 

List of Key Protected Wild Animals in China, and the List of Terrestrial Wild Animals with Important Ecological, 

Scientific and Social Value Protected by China. AI helps us identify text, pictures, videos, live broadcasts, and 

other content that may represent attempts at illicit wildlife sales.

The Laohegou Protected Area is one of the best habitats for giant pandas and other rare animals such as 

Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkeys, forest musk deer, and black bears. Following training with approximately 

280,000 photos of 24 key monitored species in Laohegou, the Alibaba Cloud Wildlife AI Identification System can 

automatically identify and classify different species with an accuracy rate of 99%. Rangers are equipped with 

modified patrol terminals that reduce their previous workload by 80%. With these patrols now powered by our 

cloud intelligence technology, the staff have seen a big leap in their ability to identify and locate animals including 

giant pandas. 

Improving the water environment in our surrounding communities

In 2018, the Alibaba Foundation and Minsheng Tonghui Charity Foundation jointly launched the 

"Qiandao Lake Water Fund" project to address agricultural pollution at Qiandao Lake, the water source 

for Hangzhou and home to 200,000 residents, most of whom are farmers. Non-point source pollution is a 

common challenge in water management and is a notoriously difficult issue worldwide. We established 

conservation demonstration areas at the source of rivers and outlets of lakes to reduce pollution by 

means of source reduction and process interception while scientifically monitoring the areas and 

establishing practices to balance production and pollution reduction. By the conclusion of the first phase 

at the end of 2021, the project had promoted the improvement of agricultural management measures 

on more than 330 hectares of farmland to reduce water pollution. This project was an award-winning 

environmental protection project in the 2020 China Charity Competition and was also recognized as 

one of the "100+ Biodiversity Positive Practices and Actions Around the World" by the United Nations 

Convention on Biological Diversity COP15 in 2021, and included in the United Nations Food and 

Agriculture Organization (FAO)’s Nature-based Agriculture Solutions. In April 2022, the second phase of the 

project was launched and plans to assist local governments to expand nature-based solutions and best 

management practices, explore market-based tools for water conservation through ecological product 

value creation and a compensation mechanism, and broaden public participation.

how sustainably we can develop as a company. 

To accomplish this goal, we 
commit to four norms:

∙ Fair and competitive compensation and

"benefits with warmth"

diverse work environment

When Alibaba was founded over 20 years ago, the original employees envisioned a company different from 

those they had known before. They imagined a company that embraces a diversity of people, talents, roles, 

views, backgrounds, and lifestyles, where people could be different and even disagree with each other, yet still 

work together and challenge one another to learn and grow. They pictured a company that eschews traditional 

hierarchy for a direct, candid, and collaborative culture. We would not have survived and grown over all these 

years without such a culture among our people, or "Aliren." Alibaba has developed into a global technology 

company with 254,941 diverse and talented Aliren as of March 31, 2022, working in twenty-seven countries and 

regions.

063 / 064

As a technology company that operates globally, we believe that an equal, dignified, inclusive, and 

diverse work environment is crucial to unleash the potential of our employees and to help stimulate 

collaboration. Based on Alibaba's unique culture, we have always tried to adhere to the following 

people-oriented values:

Customers first, 
employees second, 
shareholders third

Trust makes 
everything 
simple

Change is the 
only constant

Today's best 
performance is 
tomorrow's baseline

If not now, when? 
If not me, who?

Live seriously, 
work happily

    Customers first, employees second, shareholders third

This reflects our choice of what’s important in the order of priority. Only by creating sustained customer value 
can employees grow and shareholders achieve long-term benefit.

    Trust makes everything simple

Complexity begets complexity, and simplicity breeds simplicity. Aliren are straightforward – what you see is 
what you get. With trust, there is no second-guessing or suspicion, and the result is simplicity and efficiency.

    Change is the only constant

Whether you change or not, the world is changing, our customers are changing and the competitive landscape 
is changing. We must face change with respect and humility. Whether you change yourself or create change, 
both are the best kinds of change. Embracing change is the most unique part of our DNA.

    Today's best performance is tomorrow's baseline

In bad times, we know how to motivate ourselves; in good times, we dare to set “dream targets” (stretch 
goals). We must challenge ourselves, motivate ourselves and exceed ourselves.

    If not now, when? If not me, who?

This was a tagline in Alibaba’s first job advertisement and became our first proverb. It encourages employees 
to think independently, be brave and take responsibility, and be diligent in exploration.

    Live seriously, work happily

Enjoy work as you enjoy life; treat life seriously as you do work. If you live with purpose, you will find reward. 
You make Alibaba different and make your loved ones proud. Everyone has their own view of work and life; we 
respect our people's choices.

Juice with Daniel

A candid and open culture starts from the top. "Juice with Daniel" is one of many avenues through which Alibaba 

encourages dialogue, and is an important example for other managers to follow. Alibaba Group Chairman and CEO 

Daniel Zhang sets up regular sessions to facilitate frank communication with groups of employees. In FY2022, eight 

such sessions were held with summaries made available to all Aliren. Topics of discussions included employee welfare, 

promotions, job transfers,  performance evaluation, customer relations, management practices, and company strategy 

and actions, among others. In FY2022, 90,435 employees read session summaries, totaling 565,859 pageviews. 

Conversations in these forums have prompted company policy adjustments and new benefit plans for employees, such 

as canceling weekly reports, removing employee ranks from directories, more support for internal transfers, travel policy 

changes, and the launch of companionship and parental leave.

Aliway

Booking

Now running for 13 years, Aliway is Alibaba's lively 

internal forum where Aliren share and exchange 

thoughts and experiences, and help each other with 

questions and problems. Aliway is an open and 

transparent communication forum, true to Alibaba's 

values and long-held belief that only candid 

discussions can bring us long-term value. In FY2022, 

123,867 employees were active on Aliway.¹

"Booking" is an Alibaba tradition that seeks to break vertical and horizontal barriers between managers 

and employees, and encourages managers to take the initiative to communicate with employees. 

Managers open their digital calendars on our Booking system, and employees, including those in other 

departments, can "book" conversation slots to meet with them. The program facilitates both online and 

offline communications between managers and employees.

¹ Active employees on Aliway are defined as employees who logged in and browsed the system at least once in FY2022.

Professional hiring and recruitment 

Connecting to the young and talented

Each year, we host enriching programs to attract top talents through the Ali Stars tech talent program at various 

universities, where we invite senior managers to discuss the future with young students. Once a year, we also 

organize a series of "Coffee with Alibaba" meetings around campuses, where our employees chat with students 

about their careers at Alibaba. Our "Minute of Blinding Lights" comedy talk show is one of the most popular student 

events of the season. Each of our departments presents in the show, and students vote to select their favorite. This 

gives everyone a taste of each department, while at the same time cultivating an appreciation of Alibaba's lively

We have rolled out the "Let's Go Interns" platform, whereby we encourage interns to share their life and work 

experiences. The platform's "Speak Up Interns" activity gets interns to come together to learn from each other's 

internship experiences and make friends. Through these activities, we offer talented recruits a flavor of our 

engaging company culture as well as practical help to make a smooth transition from the campus to the workplace.

which we promise to provide all candidates fair access to information and resources, and promote a transparent and 

friendly recruitment process. We continue to work with various universities and research institutions to recruit talent.

Alibaba respects and protects the rights and interests of employees, follows the Universal Declaration of Human 

Rights, the International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention, the Labor Law of the People's Republic of China and 

other international conventions and local regulations on labor and employee rights. We sign labor contracts with 

employees in accordance with the law, adhere to the principle of equal employment, firmly oppose employment 

discrimination, and require that the recruitment, promotion, and remuneration of employees be non-discriminatory. 

We treat employees of different nationalities, races, ages, genders, religious beliefs, and cultural backgrounds fairly 

and equitably, protect the legitimate rights and interests of female employees, and resist all forms of child labor and 

forced labor. We let employees equally enjoy their legal rights to labor remuneration, rest and leave, access to labor 

safety and health protection, social insurance and welfare, etc. For qualified persons with disabilities, Alibaba provides 

effective and reasonable accommodations required for work in a manner consistent with applicable laws.

We have established internal management codes such as the Alibaba Code of Business Conduct, the Employee 

Disciplinary System, the Alibaba Group Employee Leave Policy, and the Employee Performance Management System 

to ensure that employees can work and grow in a fair environment with great prospects. 

Alibaba became a party to the UN Global Compact in February 2021, endorsing and supporting the initiative's ten principles 

(please refer to Appendix 5 for more details) and incorporating them into our corporate strategy, culture, and daily operations.

Being able to recruit the best talent from schools is a major

We strive to support our people's physical and 

emotional well-being. Our gyms, sports facilities, 

and wellness centers provide employees with a full 

range of services, including exercise, relaxation, and 

health consultation. Those are augmented by services 

including psychological counseling, mental health-

as stress management, interpersonal relationships, and

Responding to COVID-19

When the global COVID-19 pandemic struck, our 

immediate priority was to protect our people. 

We developed a new set of digital procedures 

to minimize the risk of employees catching the 

virus, while at the same time aiming to minimize 

disruption to their work and lives. 

First, we aimed to be responsive and took stricter 

measures to protect our people. We developed the 

internal health system "Tenzo Pass Code" to allow 

employees to report on their health status during 

the outbreak, helping us to identify potential risks. 

Moreover, we provided medical supplies to 

employees, including distributing personal 

protection equipment (PPE), setting up COVID 

testing and vaccination stations in convenient 

locations, and establishing rules for the use 

of public facilities within our offices in order to 

minimize risks to our employees.

Lastly, when there was a shortage of supplies for 

certain regions, we sent affected employees and 

their families food items and health supplies. 

We also provide professional and targeted health benefits according to the needs of employees, such as care for 

women and children, free health clinics (including free Chinese medicine clinics), and other activities.

The company operates 24 canteens and dining halls across our campuses, with healthy and nutritious food offerings 

covering a variety of cuisines. They often provide seasonal foods and special holiday meals. The campuses are full 

of fruit shops, convenience stores, milk tea shops, and coffee and dessert shops, giving employees places to meet 

and socialize.

Across global campuses, the day features a series 

of activities to bring together our people and their 

families and friends to experience our vibrant culture 

firsthand, and to express our appreciation for family

Enabling a Sustainable Digital Life/2022Environmental, Social, and Governance ReportChairman's LetterExecutive SummaryEnvironmentConsumersCommunityPhilanthropyTrustEmployeesSmallBusinessesTrustExecutive SummaryEnvironmentCommunityPhilanthropyEmployeesSmallBusinessesChairman's LetterTrustAs a leading global digital consumer platform, it is our responsibility to be clear about what sustainable 

consumption should be and what we can do to make it possible. In this regard, the United Nation's SDGs help 

define sustainable consumption by balancing the enhancement of individual well-being with the need for social 

responsibility. Eradicating hunger is the most basic foundation for attaining these goals, and the next level of 

support is enabling everyone to improve their health and well-being as they see fit. This better life requires that 

people be able to access products and services for their diverse needs. It also entails that consumers trust their 

suppliers, including with the protection of their privacy and data security. Finally, consumption must not harm 

the environment and society. All of this means that consumers should be able to consume in diverse, inclusive, 

trustworthy, and environmentally and socially responsible ways.

Attaining these goals remains a daunting prospect. Some people's fulfillment of basic needs are still on the rise, 

while others are now focused on product quality, variety, and experiences.

We believe that digital technology provides unprecedented potential in delivering the goal of a more diverse, 

inclusive, and responsible life for everyone.

they want.

infrastructure, these experiences are accessible to many. We provide services including nearly instant, half-day, 

same-day, or next-day delivery options, as well as next-day pick-up services. In areas traditionally underserved 

by brick-and-mortar retailers, a world of choice is suddenly on people's doorsteps. Ultimately, we wish for 

more of our users to have access to the "instant consumption experience."

We provide consumers with the leading global brands, which have 

settled in large numbers on Tmall as their "second official website" 

Alibaba platforms provide consumers with delivery choices matching their needs

for product releases and sales. The annual Tmall 618 (June 18) sales 

festival has become increasingly regarded as a focal point in their 

sales strategies. In 2022, more than 200 major international brands 

participated in Tmall 618, with over 300 new products selling out on 

the first day. Our platforms open the world to Chinese consumers who 

can effortlessly experience the latest products from global brands.

Our platforms open doors for the fast-rising "China-chic" brands. 

Products of these brands are inspired and designed in our home 

market, showcasing the quality and upward trajectory in the value 

chain of Chinese businesses, a shift from simply Made in China, to 

Created in China.  Their development now gives consumers around the 

world more and better choices.

Alibaba has been committed since our founding to championing 

MSMEs. On our platforms, MSMEs with their many distinctive products 

can now reach consumers globally. For consumers, this is an era in 

which the niche, boutique, and varied are increasingly accessible. 

Tmall Global, which bring the best of the world to Chinese consumers, 

has been lowering barriers for new sellers and helping overseas small 

brands to flourish in the large China market.

Alibaba Health has created an integrated online and offline 

sales channel for medical diagnostics and drug purchases. 

In addition, the entire process of seeing a doctor or other 

medical professional, previously involving queues and waits, 

is now available online, including registration, appointments, 

follow-up consultations, and home delivery. Alibaba Health 

also leaned on the same integrated medical platform to serve 

6.5 million people living with chronic diseases as of March 31,

Giving consumers better value for money

An important mission of our business is to help consumers attain the best value for their money, which is 

especially crucial to those aspiring to a better life. We give full play to the advantages of digital platforms 

to provide consumers with cost-effective goods and services. We identify high-quality manufacturers and 

assist them in planning and producing cost-effective goods with our market insights. We also continuously 

improve efficiencies across a vast warehousing and fulfillment network.

We try to bring more value to more diverse consumers 

through new business models. For instance, Taobao Deals 

enables manufacturers and brands to sell directly to 

consumers to meet their needs for value-for-money products. 

In FY2022, Taobao Deals passed the 300 million user 

milestone.

We also provide consumers with convenient money-saving functionalities. In 2021, Taobao launched the 

"Find Similar" function, allowing consumers to compare prices conveniently with similar goods. We launched 

a "Price Guarantee" feature, whereby consumers may apply for a price-difference refund on certain 

guaranteed goods if the price drops in the subsequent 90 days. We want to ensure a more transparent and 

Lazada introduces same-day delivery services in Manila, the Philippines

equitable market for our consumers.

In November 2021, Lazada Philippines formally rolled out same-day delivery in Manila. Before then, consumers generally 

expected a fulfillment cycle of 3-to-5 days. Our new service greatly improved convenience for Filipino shoppers. All 

manner of goods including daily sundries, health products, and even important tools can be delivered to customers in 

Manila within a few hours.

Taocaicai brings quality, value, and efficiency to consumers in remote areas

Through Taocaicai, consumers in less affluent and remote 

regions can enjoy variety and value for many goods that 

were previously inaccessible to them. Taocaicai has built 

a pool of more than 700 domestic and global agricultural 

direct procurement bases to offer over 1 million quality 

products. While Taocaicai often operates in locations with 

less developed infrastructure, it builds its warehouses 

to strict standards, with temperature-controlled storage 

rooms to help reduce waste and guarantee the freshness 

and safety of goods. 

Enabling a Sustainable Digital Life/2022Environmental, Social, and Governance ReportChairman's LetterExecutive SummaryEnvironmentConsumersCommunityPhilanthropyTrustEmployeesSmallBusinessesInclusive consumption

One of our central aims is to ensure the benefits of the modern digital economy are accessible to all. To ensure 

that no one is left behind, we pay special attention to bringing the possibility of a better consumer life to 

underdeveloped areas, especially rural and remote areas, as well as to groups often facing digital challenges, 

including senior citizens, people living with disabilities, and others.

Serving consumers in rural and remote areas

In FY2022, over 70% of our new annual active consumers in China came from relatively less developed regions 

(e.g., third-tier cities and below, and more remote areas). This progress has relied on the small town and rural 

logistics infrastructure we have put great effort into building, which enables us to bring modern commerce 

to remote areas that often face higher transport costs, lower density, and generally poorer commercial 

infrastructure. By March 31, 2022, Cainiao had close to 50,000 village stations across the country. These service 

capabilities and multi-party logistics companies are making a difference in consumers' daily lives, narrowing 

the digital gap with urban households.

Cainiao Post station breathes new life to the mountain village of Yangla

The village of Yangla in Yunnan Province is surrounded by 

the snow-capped Hengduan Mountains. After the young 

Peichu Lurong had lived some time outside the region, 

he thought about the long trek residents in his hometown 

had to make to pick up mail. That encouraged Lurong to 

return home to establish a Cainiao Post station. Each day 

he makes a round trip of over 100 kilometers to retrieve 

packages for the 500 inhabitants of his village.

Ensuring a rich digital life for senior citizens

While China's population continues to age, we know that many senior citizens have found it more 

difficult to integrate fast-evolving digital tools into their lives. As a result, we continue to specially 

design services for our senior consumers. We maintain and evolve a set of standards for age-focused 

features under our "Special Action for Aging and Barrier-free Transformation of Internet Applications." A 

"senior mode" on a number of our apps incorporates an enlarged display font and a special interface 

for senior users, greatly improving the ease of use.

Age-friendly innovations in the Taobao app

Taobao senior mode addresses key issues faced by older 

users, which we call the "three struggles": the struggle 

to see clearly, the struggle to understand fully, and the 

struggle to use effectively. We have enlarged display 

fonts and made our interface easier to read. We designed 

our voice assistant to cover search, logistics, reminders, 

phone bills, interactions and other scenarios, simplifying

the text-input process for this older cohort. Moreover, we have made it possible for family and friends to 

quickly share a one-click link to enable senior mode. Furthermore, we have added a special prompt to the 

payment interface to make the it easier to use and help senior users encountering difficulties in completing 

their purchases. We even added a feature to allow a family member to pay for them. 

Amap's WeCare plan for helping the elderly  

In cooperation with the National Office on Aging, our Amap 

online navigation tool carried out the WeCare Plan for 

Helping the Elderly. Projects included R&D for specialized 

taxi functions for seniors, the issuance of subsidies to 

"It's difficult to travel along this winding, snow-covered road, so the delivery center that I manage is the only  

encourage seniors to seek medical care, the construction

Enabling barrier-free digital consumption

Because technology is all too often designed without taking them into account, the 85 million people living with 

disabilities in China frequently miss out on the benefits of digital life.¹ We work hard to understand the needs of 

this group and create digital products and services that are optimized for accessibility.

We established the Taobao Information Accessibility Lab back in 2011, and since then we have built a 

systematic product monitoring and improvement mechanism for ensuring a barrier-free user experience. We 

prioritize feedback on user interface (UI) obstacles, and regularly invite our target user base to share their 

actual experiences and needs.

A range of our products are continuously optimizing their accessible UI. At present, Taobao's app fully supports 

use by visually impaired users, including text and picture-to-voice functions. In FY2022, Taobao served 305,000 

visually-impaired users.

Barrier-free online theater for visually impaired users

In December 2020, our Youku video hosting platform and the China Braille Library cooperated to launch 

the first online audio-visual platform for barrier-free services in the industry, and officially launched 

a "Barrier-free Theater." On International Day for People with Disabilities, we released the barrier-free 

edition of Youku app with film and television content, especially for short videos. After the version was 

launched, visually impaired users could use screen reading software to read the information on our 

interface and select their favorite film and television works through voice commands. 

Through collecting extensive feedback from visually impaired users on their pain points with technology, 

we optimized the video player interaction, providing a much improved accessible viewing experience. In 

FY2022, nearly 1.5 million viewers watched movies on Youku Barrier-free Theater.

Barrier-free travel

To give people with mobility disabilities easier access to 

travel and transit, Amap launched the accessibility routing 

and facility labeling function on its maps in 2017. It works 

by displaying  accessible elevators on subway station 

maps, and automatically plotting accessible routes for the 

user with one click. Amap is also the first company in China 

to develop a "visually impaired mode," making it easier for 

the visually impaired them to understand real-time road 

information.

Enjoying trustworthy consumption is an essential part of a better digital life. We strive to ensure our consumers 

can have confidence in three areas: product quality and safety, user privacy and data security protection, and 

responsive service.

Improving product quality and safety

In January 2017, we established the Alibaba Anti-Counterfeiting Alliance (AACA) to work collectively to 

tackle the challenge of counterfeit goods by combining the inherent knowledge of brand owners, our 

intelligent technology, as well as law enforcement and civil legal channels. As of March 2022, more 

than 1,100 brands from 21 countries have joined the AACA. The alliance not only addresses Alibaba's 

retail ecosystem and merchants, but also disseminates information and tools to help them protect 

We take seriously our role as the gatekeeper for consumers on our platforms, and we strive to establish clear 

their rights, and raises public awareness of the importance of protecting the intellectual property of 

and enforced rules, while developing and using the latest technology to support this role. We have established 

original brands and designs. When infringing stores are spotted in the offline world such as shopping 

a digital quality-assurance mechanism and have taken measures to govern it. 

malls, Alibaba's reporting system allows consumers to provide rights holders in the AACA with leads for 

enforcement.

104
/ 100

"Consumer Reporting System" protecting consumers from IP infringement 

Counterfeiting not only hurts rights holders, it also harms consumers and erodes their trust. In January 

2020, we officially launched the "Consumer Reporting Platform", unifying our online and offline anti-

counterfeiting cooperation network and technological capabilities. With  support from market supervision 

bureaus, public safety authorities, and judicial agencies, our system uses digital technology to enable 

consumers to work in tandem with brands to protect their rights. When consumers notice infringing stores 

in physical environments, they can access the "Consumer Reporting System" on Taobao and upload 

pictures of the infringements, the location of the seller, and other information. We then use technology to 

cross-reference before sending the information to the brand owners for enforcement action.

For example, Tmall carries out strict management of merchant platform entry, advertising and quality, 

inspection and sampling, and so on. We carefully craft and maintain quality control processes that are 

appropriate for each of our diverse services. 

Our quality assurance is underpinned by a full, closed-loop management pathway that introduces advanced 

technologies such as AI identification and blockchain traceability technology to track and promote quality, 

transparency, and reliability. We also actively collaborate with consumer groups, regulatory agencies, public-

interest organizations, and others, and share our product quality monitoring and management technology to 

combat counterfeit and shoddy goods. 

Digital authenticity system assures consumers through collaborative solution

To improve product reliability for consumers, we have 

established the Tmall Global Quality Partner Alliance, 

gathering 91 international and Chinese third-party testing 

and inspection institutions. We have formulated 25 

different international quality standards and covered 

100% of imported products listed on Tmall Global, 

protecting the interests of sellers and providing assurance 

to consumers. Since 2017, we have been running the 

Global Traceability Project. By leveraging blockchain and 

big data technology, it tracks information of the supply 

chain and links of imported products, including details on 

production, packaging, transportation, customs declarations, third-party testing, retail sales, and so on. A Tmall 

Global Traceability QR Code has been labeled on every piece of product that joined the Project, so that consumers 

have easy access to the information of the imported products, thus consuming with greater confidence.

Protecting user privacy and data security

Protecting the privacy of consumers is the basis for trustworthy consumption. However, maintaining privacy 

Privacy Code Protection service

is not just about locking away data. Merchants must understand their customers well enough to ensure that 

personalized and quality services can be provided.

Three principles of consumer privacy protection

We deeply ingrain the concept of privacy protection and data security into our practices, making full use of 

privacy technology to achieve data sharing in a trusted environment. To this end, we have formulated three 

guiding principles that we strive to follow: minimal data collection, maximum user awareness and choices, and 

the strongest user data protection in our products and services. 

Make users aware of the scope of data collection and its intended uses through clear 

prompts, pop-ups, and forms. 

Minimal data 
collection

Once data is collected, strictly protect users' basic rights in areas such as access, inquiry, 

withdrawal, modification, or deletion. 

Develop a range of privacy services and improve privacy management functions, 

including a privacy-policy inquiry portal, privacy over one's friends, and data consent 

management and withdrawal.

Maximum user 
awareness and 
choices

Ensure the user's right to know how their data is used: 1) establish an algorithm 

management system that is transparent to supervision, and can fulfill our legal 

obligations; and 2) build an algorithm operations mechanism that is transparent and 

interpretable, ensuring the user's right to know.

Opt-out option: Provide users with the option to easily opt out of personalized 

recommendations. For example, Taobao has the option to turn off recommendations 

based on personal data. 

Optimize our recommendations: Establish a feedback mechanism for users to ensure 

that they have the right to offer their opinions on the results of algorithmic decisions.

Strongest 
user data 
protection in 
our products 
and services

We keep improving our systems to ensure strong protection of user data in our products. 

In early 2022, we adopted "virtual phone number" functions for consumer privacy 

protection in major apps such as Taobao, Amap, and Ele.me. Merchants and service 

providers contact consumers without knowing their real numbers. On the Taobao app 

alone, this new function has already covered more than 500 million active consumers. 

We have developed features and mechanisms on our platforms to ensure that users can protect their personal 

privacy during the whole process of ordering, payments, and fulfillment. We only transmit data absolutely 

necessary for fulfillment. In 2022, Taobao introduced its Privacy Code Protection service, allowing users to use a 

virtual phone number throughout the whole purchase and fulfillment process. Our Amap and Ele.me apps have 

also introduced free Privacy Code Protection services, allowing complete assurance throughout the process. By 

August 15, 2022, our virtual phone number feature has covered over 500 million active consumers on Taobao.

dedicated staff with the goal of resolving customer problems. We adhere to two tenets: first, we make it as easy as 

possible for users to contact us, and then we focus on resolving their issues as expeditiously as possible.

Our technology-powered methods include a customer service hotline, live online chat rooms, and automated service 

bots available at the click of a button. Users can easily access customer service portals in all of our apps to request 

the platform's intervention should any issues arise. We were also among the first in China to launch services such as 

our 7-day "no questions asked" returns and speedy refunds for customers. In FY2022, more than 900 million orders 

were refunded, covered by our speedy refund system.

We also streamlined our resolution process. In May 2021, we launched a new complaint handling protocol that 

empowers our staff to solve user issues proactively. Meanwhile, we strive to prevent the occurrence of issues in the 

first place by constantly looking for ways to improve product quality, fulfillment, and services. In FY2022, Taobao and 

Tmall's complaint rate represented just 0.015% of total orders, with a complaint response rate of 100%.

Responsible consumption means helping consumers achieve better lives while limiting and reducing harmful social 

and environmental impacts. This covers a wide range of environmentally and socially beneficial consumer practices 

that we are supporting.

We endeavor to advocate for greater environmental awareness, using our platform to influence and change 

consumer perceptions and behaviors in multiple arenas. While we promote the adoption of low-carbon lifestyles 

on the consumer side (refer to Chapter 1, Section 2, Sub-section: Scope 3+ actions), we also stimulate the supply of 

green goods and discourage environmentally harmful goods. 

Fostering responsible consumption 

An increasing number of consumers are prioritizing responsible consumption, especially by choosing green products. 

As such, we are working to promote these sustainably-sourced goods on our platforms, such as energy-saving 

home appliances, recycled and biodegradable materials, and organic foods.  

Through a variety of offline and online channels, we are also helping to popularize green packaging and recycling 

of our products, in order to promote the green behavior of hundreds of millions of consumers. We will further 

encourage consumers to practice green consumption behavior by designing green incentives, and continuously 

expanding the green consumer community. 

The rapid increase in the use of packaging, especially plastics, has been an unfortunate by-product of growing 

consumption. At Alibaba, we have both an obligation and capacity to help forestall this trend. By adopting green 

packaging, we stimulate a series of positive effects, of which carbon reduction is only one dimension, and which 

includes knock-on effects like the reduction of plastic pollution.

We strive to make green and simple packaging options more 

visible. During our 11.11 Global Shopping Festival in 2021, in 

Taobao's "Green Mall" section, we featured goods with green 

packaging (non-tape zipper boxes, degradable packaging, 

and shipping in original boxes), including beauty, food, and 

other products. If such products are shipped through Cainiao 

Warehouse, Cainiao will mark their fulfillment details with 

a "green package" tag. During the 6.18 Shopping Festival in 2022, Taobao, Tmall, and nearly 40 brands 

collectively advocated for simpler packaging that reduces use of plastic, printing ink, and other packaging 

materials. Participating brands have integrated both simplicity and environmental awareness into using 

innovative designs to simplify and reduce packaging.

At Intime Department Stores, we have 

been replacing taped delivery boxes with 

the choice of re-usable zipper bags. On 

2022 World Earth Day, Intime set up clothes 

recycling bins in its stores and distributed 

flowers and coupons to customers who 

recycled their used clothes. 

We also encourage shipping box recycling to increase 

the lifespan of the packaging. An important channel 

of participation is through Cainiao's box recycling 

program which operates convenient box drop-off sites 

at a number of local Cainiao stations. We worked with 

our million-strong merchant partners to offer rewards 

for box recycling. The program currently covers 315 

cities in 31 provincial administrative regions.

In November 2021, Alibaba and Unilever jointly 

launched a campaign to encourage consumers 

to recycle and reuse plastic bottles at recycling 

machines by rewarding them with "green energy" 

points. Plastic recycling machines have been 

installed at more than 170 Tmall offline stores 

across the country by July 2022.

Lazada's promotion of responsible consumption in Southeast Asia

In April 2022, Lazada launched its LazEarth campaign in 

Southeast Asia, collaborating with partner brands to make 

environment-friendly products easy to access and recognize. 

These include "green" fashion brands and goods that reduce 

plastic in manufacturing, packaging, and transportation 

processes. Lazada aims to encourage more consumers to make 

responsible consumption choices, especially in the purchase 

of daily necessities. Lazada and Unilever also jointly launched 

a three-year sustainable development strategic collaboration, 

"Easy Green," to promote sustainable products. We have begun 

experimenting with "Easy Green" labels, focusing on environmentally-friendly products that are biodegradable, 

renewable, and packaged in "optimized, reduced, or no plastic" ways.

We hope to transform harmful searches into a public educational project that all 
sectors of society can participate in and make positive contributions to together. 

Junfang Zheng, Chief Risk Officer of Alibaba Group

We also take seriously the potential for facilitation of self-harm. In July 2019, several teams at Alibaba 

jointly introduce the "Life is Precious" project, focused on noticing early warning signs of psychological 

crisis among users. When sellers are alerted to a risk, such as through a customer searching or asking 

about self-harm implements, they act as the first line of defense by immediately responding with 

dissuasion and words of comfort while also contacting trained professionals in Alibaba Safety's suicide 

prevention team. In the case of a severe emergency, Alibaba will also contact local first responders so that 

they can intervene and help. Through March 31, 2022, over 4,400 people who have shown signs of distress 

have received such intervention on our platforms. Beyond that, more than 34,000 people have called the 

hotline on the project page for psychological counseling. 

Keeping platform users safe from harm

Building the world's leading circular goods market 

As an e-commerce platform, we also have a special obligation to ensure our platforms are not used for trade that

300 million users, of whom 50% are young "post-1990s" Gen-Z consumers who are steering future trends. 

In 2020, we worked with partners to launch the GreenNet Program for responsible consumption. This works by

High-performance technologies

The 21st century is the century of digitalization. Fully harvesting the digital dividends for everyone relies 

critically on driving computing performance higher while using fewer resources such as energy. 

As companies move to the cloud, they see major performance and efficiency gains, and reduced reliance on 

resources, with benefits to themselves and to the environment. Alibaba Cloud is a recognized global leader in 

cloud services. In the 2021 Gartner Solution Scorecard for integrated IaaS and PaaS, Alibaba Cloud received the 

highest scores in the four core evaluations of computing, storage, network, and security (required), separately.

Aside from improving our own operations, we have also leveraged the cloud to create intelligent tools 

to help our business ecosystem achieve a green transition. This includes our "Energy Expert," which 

helps organizations monitor and reduce their energy use. For more information, please refer to Section 

2 of Chapter 1, "Amplifying decarbonization through our platform ecosystem."

Technological advances

Maintaining our leadership in core technologies is essential to achieving all our goals. What makes 

this possible is our people working on the cutting-edge of many foundational technologies. Alibaba 

currently holds more than 13,000 global patents, with 10,000 in key fields that include cloud computing, 

artificial intelligence, data technology, and other areas of intense research.

Inclusive technologies

At Alibaba, we strive to make it easy for anyone to start a new business using our cloud and other platforms. 

More than ten million MSMEs in our platform ecosystem, such as our merchants, use cloud computing to 

operate their businesses. Besides that, more than four million customers use Alibaba Cloud services globally. 

In China, one measure of our success is that among the nationally recognized "little giants," - small, leading 

innovative firms across varied sectors - 65% were using Alibaba Cloud, and 50% of them were using our 

smart office platform DingTalk, as of the end of FY2022.

Fostering an open community for innovation

Alibaba has been a firm believer in open ecosystems in technology and is an active participant in open-source 

projects. Alibaba was ranked first for many years in open-source activity and influence among Chinese enterprises. 

We also received the most awards in the 2021 "Science and Technology Innovation China" Open Source List, 

launched by the China Association for Science and Technology. InfoQ ranked Alibaba first in their top 10 list of 

enterprise contributions in their latest report, China Open Source Development Research and Analysis 2022. In their 

list of the top 30 open-source projects, Alibaba alone accounted for 11 projects.

So far, more than 30,000 developers globally have participated in Alibaba-initiated open-source projects. These 

projects have garnered more than 1 million stars on GitHub and are utilized by companies around the world. 

Alibaba is also deeply involved in the leading open-source foundations and organizations, including the Open Atom 

Foundation, Linux Foundation, CNCF Foundation, Apache Software Foundation, and Open Container Organization 

To foster a culture that values basic science research, Alibaba sponsors activities aimed at stimulating

Alibaba seeks to level the playing field for smaller companies by arming them with corporate management 

capacities and dynamic markets, which we call a "business operating system," that supports as many enterprises as 

possible and "makes it easy to do business anywhere."

Alibaba equips small businesses and their entrepreneurs with many capabilities and market opportunities previously 

reserved for large corporations, allowing them to successfully compete while maintaining their nimbleness and 

innovative drive. We continue to build platforms that link MSMEs with various markets and consumers. At the same 

time, MSMEs using our cloud-based tools can gain access to a host of digital intelligent business solutions, including 

branding, product sourcing, sales, marketing, distribution channels, manufacturing support, customer services, 

finance, logistics supply chain, organizational management, and information technology. 

In this section, we first cover the impact of our digital intelligent business solutions in several dimensions including 

starting up, decision support, work collaboration, logistics, financing, intellectual property protection, and training 

and learning. Then we illustrate our efforts in connecting MSMEs with market opportunities.

the threshold and ease many obstacles for the start-up and digital operations of small businesses.

To further simplify operations for small business owners, besides Tobao's service marketplace, we offer 

Qianniu as a one-stop management platform for our merchants with a full suite of e-commerce business 

tools, including goods management, order management, marketing, CRM, cash management, logistics, online 

operations, business consultation, and data analysis. Users need only a mobile phone to access all the tools 

anytime, anywhere. In FY2022, more than nine million active merchants on our platforms used Qianniu to 

manage their stores.

Smart decision-making

Alibaba's Business Advisor, first launched in 2014, is our e-commerce analytics suite to help merchants gain 

insights about their business and thus improve their decisions. Aside from providing analysis of the business, 

market dynamics, and competition, Business Advisor also features online coaching and training. Currently, 

approximately 90% of our merchants with monthly sales over RMB300,000 are users of Business Advisor.

This year, we established a dedicated DaaS ("data intelligence as a service") company, Alibaba Lingyang 

("antelope"), that integrates Alibaba's ten years of experience across our businesses to provide small 

businesses with a matrix of intelligence tools that support business analysis, customer service, data 

management, and inventory management, among others. These tools help users unlock the growth potential 

of their data.

Fee reductions and subsidies to help MSMEs weather COVID-19 disruptions

Small businesses have often been less able to withstand shocks, notably during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have 

taken a series of measures to help the MSMEs on our platforms, including subsidies, fee waivers, traffic support, and 

programs to aid logistics and financing. In FY2022, we implemented a number of measures, including subsidies, 

which covered roughly 9 million merchants on our Taobao and Tmall platforms.

Subsidies for new merchants: nearly 

200,000 new merchants on Taobao and 

Tmall were granted subsidies.

Smart work collaboration

DingTalk is our digital office communications and application development suite that offers new ways of 

working, sharing, and collaborating. It now serves users from more than 21 million organizations and 500 

million users across the world. DingTalk and its ecosystem of tools have been helping these organizations 

digitize office operations such as team management, projects, meetings, calendars, financials, inventories, 

and documents. For small businesses with limited internal IT capabilities, we have developed low-code or 

even no-code products and services. 

In June 2021, DingTalk launched more than 20 free software suites that provide easy-to-use digital 

solutions for cost reduction and efficiency increases. These covered recruitment, employee training, project 

management, and so forth, and introduced low-code support for adding user-defined functions. Today, 

around 70% of DingTalk business users are MSMEs. We made particular efforts to help these businesses keep 

operating after the pandemic began.

Smart logistics and supply chains

Since 2014, Cainiao has offered fully digitized batch order processing that offered a leap in capabilities for 

businesses regardless of size. 

We have established a cost-effective logistic network that provides diversified logistics services and 

continuously works to reduce costs and improve logistics efficiency for our customers, which especially 

benefits MSMEs. In China, Cainiao maintains more than 10 million square meters of warehouse space, and its 

direct distribution service covers more than 2,800 districts and counties. Meanwhile, Cainiao Global reaches 

more than 160 countries and regions with its multimodal transport solutions. 

We continuously work to optimize the convenience of our services with digital technology. For example, our 

digital supply chain management system and digitally powered distribution facilities have reduced inventory 

requirements and improved turnover, while our innovations in unmanned vehicles have also been widely

Operations Research and the Management Sciences, recognizing our contributions to the optimization 

of supply chain management and operations planning – based on integrated forecasting, inventory, and 

price recommendation algorithms. This made Alibaba the only company in the last 20 years to reach the 

competition’s finals for two consecutive years, and the only Chinese company among the finalists this year.

MSMEs often lack collateral or traditional credit history, which can make obtaining traditional financing an 

insurmountable challenge. Our ecosystem financing partner uses big data to solve this impediment, assessing credit 

risk quickly to provide convenient unsecured loans for small businesses.

Intellectual property protection

A secure environment for intellectual property rights (IPR) development is key to promoting innovation. Alibaba 

established an intellectual property rights protection system as early as 2002. Through extensive stakeholder 

cooperation over the past 20 years, we have built this system into a comprehensive framework. It covers a breadth 

of protection: from trademarks to many other rights, both online and offline enforcement, supporting large global 

brands and MSMEs, and combating counterfeiting while developing systems that encourage innovation and 

originality. 

We are continuously improving our IP protection framework

Alibaba is committed to continuously optimizing our sophisticated notice-and-takedown system, the Alibaba 

Intellectual Property Protection Platform ("the IPP"). We enable protection across a wide range of scenarios 

encountered by the vast number of rights holders who work with us. As of March 31, 2022, more than 660,000 IP 

rights worldwide were protected on the IPP, through over 590,000 accounts. Ensuring the effectiveness of the IPP, 

98% of takedown requests are acted upon within 24 hours. 

In 2020, Alibaba launched the "Simp'Ali" online rights protection program for MSMEs around the world. Simp’Ali 

simplifies the takedown request procedures for participants in the program, thus improving the efficiency of rights 

protection, and further strengthening the accessibility of the IPP for those companies with less experience in 

online reporting.

Alibaba also carries out proactive monitoring across our platforms through our "IPR Protection Tech Brain," with 

technology that identifies and removes suspected infringing and other potentially problematic products. We 

continuously upgrade this technology, in collaboration with rights holders.

We work in collaboration to tackle IP violations

Alibaba assists law enforcement agencies and rights holders to crack down on counterfeiters and 
counterfeit goods using intelligent algorithms. In FY2022, Alibaba assisted authorities to carry out offline 
enforcement, and assisted in the investigation and resolution of 2,802 counterfeiting cases, with a total 
estimated case value of RMB3.557 billion.

We cooperate with a series of domestic and foreign agencies and industry associations to provide one-
stop intellectual property protection for products bearing geographical indications. By March 31, 2022, a 
total of 170 geographical indication certification marks were being protected.

We worked with businesses to establish the world's first e-commerce anti-counterfeiting alliance, the 
Alibaba Anti-Counterfeiting Alliance (AACA). The alliance provides a multi-party governance structure to 
address the problems of counterfeits and infringements, and has established extensive industry influence. 
As of March 2022, the AACA included more than 1,100 brands from 21 countries.

We work with various industry associations such as the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC), 
European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), China–Britain Business Council 
(CBBC), Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA), and the Japanese Intellectual Property Group 
(IPG) in China. Together, these collaborations and industry forums create new models to promote a healthy 
international e-commerce business environment.

Alibaba's AI-powered IPR Protection Tech Brain is a great initiative. It is also 
a leading technology in the industry, and is more effective than traditional 
methods. Authorities should support AI anti-counterfeiting methods, as they 
will bolster the industry.

AI virtual models promoting legal use of product imagery

Using human models to show clothing can be expensive, time consuming, and 

sometimes leads to the unauthorized use of modeled product images. Alibaba's 

"Virtual Model" system, released in 2020, lets merchants use AI generated images 

of models displaying products such as apparel. Made available without charge to 

our merchants, Virtual Model is now widely used across several of our e-commerce 

platforms. As of March 2022, more than 20,000 merchants have used the system 

to generate more than 390,000 images. The algorithms used in Virtual Model 

have been commended at top international academic conferences such as CVPR, 

ACM MM, and AAAI, and are covered by five patent applications.

Connecting to the domestic market

Across our varied platforms including Taobao, Taobao Deals, Ele.me, and others, the common appeal is in the 

business and lifestyle ecosystem built by tens of millions of small businesses and many more customers. Our 

business operating system offers foundational tools that bridge consumers and merchants, and most critically, 

provides unprecedented market opportunities for MSMEs. 

From a Small Stall to a "Super Factory"

14 years ago, a young man from Chaoshan named Xiaowei Li travelled to Shenzhen with 20,000 yuan in his pocket 

to set up a stall trading in electronic chips. This grew into his own manufacturing firm "Tongheng Weichuang," 

which specializes in wireless communications and network equipment. 

Xiaowei began as an OEM manufacturer, but margins were always thin, and in 2014 he launched products under 

his own brand. Sales and marketing for smaller manufacturers has always been a challenge. In 2017, his business 

found the perfect partner for its development with our 1688.com e-commerce platform for producers. 

Since settling on 1688, Xiaowei's business has been helped by the platform to navigate a range of growth 

milestones and challenges, eventually seeing some of his products become top performers on a variety of 

e-commerce platforms. 1688's advanced e-commerce technology has been of particular help to him during the

COVID-19 pandemic by allowing him to fully showcase his products to customers without them needing to leave

home and visit his factory. His business was given a further boost by 1688's "Super Factory" brand support and

incubation program, launched in 2020, which has increased their online traffic and helped establish long-term

supplier partnerships with large clients including Lenovo and Tencent.

Before we met 1688, we were just a small OEM factory. Since meeting 1688, we 
have built a "super factory" now selling over RMB100 million annually.

Xiaowei Li

Not long ago, many of the industrial belt manufacturers in Hebei were limited to being only 

regional businesses due to factors such as logistics costs and branding. With the Taobao Deals M2C 

(manufacturer-to-consumer) model in operation from 2020 onwards, over 40,000 Hebei brands have 

now broken barriers. 

After Shijiazhuang Chuangmei Carpet Factory opened its Taobao Deals direct-sale store, online revenue 

grew to account for 40% of total sales. According to factory director Xu Zhang, Chuangmei previously 

stocked products based on past experience, but frequently faced inventory mismatches. At its worst, this 

led to a backlog of RMB6 million in raw materials in 2017 due to incorrect forecasting.  Now with advance 

orders from e-commerce, their production is determined by sales, without inventory problems. Moreover, 

Taobao Deals facilitates the selection of best-selling products. In the past, they often placed 10 bets for 

one winner. Now, they design new products with data, which helps merchants predict a product's success 

rate with a high degree of accuracy. In addition, by using the Taobao Deals warehouse, Chuangmei has 

cut delivery times by an average of 5 hours and logistics costs by 15%.

If we use PVC mats to illustrate, previously the costs for retail deliveries 
were 30 times more than for wholesale. Now we are able to fulfill small 
orders efficiently and can carry out all orders with a unified standard.

Connecting to the global market

We help small businesses achieve their global aspirations in three essential ways: helping global merchants to buy 

and sell globally, including accessing customers in China; helping Chinese MSMEs to venture overseas; and helping 

MSMEs outside China to sell more easily in their home markets.

Helping merchants buy and sell globally

In FY2022, there were over 245,000 paying members from China and around the world on Alibaba.com, through 

which more than 40 million buyers from over 190 countries sourced business or completed transactions. 

In 2016, Alibaba proposed the electronic World Trade Platform (eWTP) initiative, aiming to foster more convenient, 

innovative, and inclusive global trade through digitalization and collaboration. At present, eWTP has launched 10 

cooperative projects on four continents. These include promoting cross-border digital commerce, improving digital 

finance and digital logistics, building the digital Public Service Platform (PSP) to facilitate trade, as well as carrying

brand in Turkey with a market share of 50%. In June 2019, ebebek

Bringing Taobao Villages to Mexico

Ethiopian coffee growers sold more than 10,000 packs instantly 

In Ethiopia, an estimated 20% of the workforce is tied to the 

coffee industry. With the COVID pandemic, the Ethiopian 

coffee industry saw a sudden drop in sales, along with 

severe disruptions in production and logistics. Many 

small businesses were deeply affected, so in late 2021, 

we worked with the local government and international 

organizations to carry out a project to help some 

businesses recover. Through training sessions, local MSMEs 

learned about packaging, online store management, 

and logistics. In December 2021, this cooperation helped 

three local Ethiopian coffee brands become the first to 

successfully onboard with Tmall Global and sell directly 

into the Chinese market. During Chinese New Year in 2022, 

these Ethiopian brands launched their first livestreaming 

promotion, resulting in more than 10,000 packs of coffee 

being sold in seconds.

As a young Mexican studying abroad in China, Andres Diaz Bedolla participated in the eWTP Global Digital 

Talent (eWTP – GDT) program. While attending this program, Andres was highly impressed by the Taobao 

villages he visited, such as Bainiu Village, and he felt this model would work well in Mexico too. 

In 2020, with the support of the Mexican government and as an eWTP GDT partner, Andres brought the 

GDT and the Taobao village models to five Mexican states. As of 2021, over 400 university teachers had 

participated in the eWTP GDT program, learning both theoretical concepts in the digital economy and how 

to apply best practices. Afterwards, these 

teachers applied the knowledge they 

gained from the eWTP GDT program in their 

own classes, benefiting over 8,000 students. 

These students were linked with 1,500 local 

enterprises and small businesses, helping 

them undergo a digital upgrade to bring 

their products online, use digital payments, 

and manage logistics. These merchants are 

now selling their Mexican specialty products, 

including Mexican honey, leather goods, 

and molcajete to global consumers. Andres 

saw his aspirations reach fruition with a 

number of these "Mexican digital villages."

Creating and promoting quality, inclusive employment is an important way business can contribute to society. This 

is particularly meaningful when we can provide fair opportunities to historically underrepresented groups, and give 

people new skills, thus helping them develop. The growth of our platform helps to generate extremely scalable, 

flexible, high-quality, and inclusive employment compared to traditional businesses. 

Large-scale employment

Company direct employment

As of March 31, 2022, Alibaba Group directly employed more than 250,000 full-time employees in 27 countries 

and regions. While working to make possible all that we do, they continue to acquire and enhance their skills 

on the job, making themselves increasingly competitive in the digital era.

Platform employment

Our platform ecosystem has gathered together more than one billion consumers and tens of millions of 

MSMEs and individual workers. Their economic activity drives a series of new job opportunities, such as 

livestreaming anchors, customer service agents, product marketers, couriers, and so on. At the same time, the 

many transactions on the platform facilitate the circulation of goods and services, and promote employment 

in the upstream and downstream businesses such as manufacturing. We see our most important role not as 

selling products, but as working with myriad stakeholders to develop a vibrant ecosystem with tens of millions 

of businesses, most of which are MSMEs and individual workers. Helping others obtain opportunity is our best 

contribution to social value.

According to a research report by the School of Labor and Human Resources of Renmin University of China 

(henceforth RUC team), our platforms have helped create and promote employment opportunities for more 

than 60 million workers, hundreds of times the number of our own employees.

Alibaba primarily helps to redress these imbalances in three ways:

First, by continuing to spur economic development by building China's largest e-commerce market into rural 

areas to better connect rural and urban economies and markets.

Second, by doing our part to help upgrade rural value chains, and bring much-needed logistics facilities, 

production technologies, as well as marketing and branding capabilities. By sharing our digital platform and 

branding programs, we are helping rural communities and their entrepreneurs to meet the growing demand

them to adjust their production efficiently. As of October 2021, there were 136 Freshippo villages nationwide, 

spread across 19 provinces and regions.  

In December 2020, Daizhuang Village became the first "Freshippo Village" in Jiangsu Province. Freshippo 

meticulously established standards for each type of agricultural product from the village, earning Daizhuang a 

reputation as a high-quality "brand" among consumers. What began with rice has now steadily expanded to 40

One way Alibaba is positioned to support a successful rural economy is by helping to improve digital 

and offline businesses, there is much we can do to link agriculture, education, health and wellness, and leisure 

literacy, especially that of working-age residents, to bolster their employment opportunities. As such, 

together to boost local tourism. We believe this is another important avenue for stimulating rural economies by 

Alibaba is making talent development and capacity building the central focus of our strategy for rural 

linking them to urban demand. In FY2023, we aim to help build up 10 model rural tourism counties, to help further 

development, which manifests itself in a number of programs:

promote this development and to enable more people to enjoy what the countryside has to offer.

Alibaba boosts agritourism in Hengyi Village

1. We station Alibaba employees in rural areas with schemes such as our "rural commissioner"

and "rural technology officers" programs. These are uniquely valuable programs, by bringing

digitally savvy senior managers to places that have lacked such experience before.

2. We establish digital employment and training schemes to create opportunities, building up

the local digital economy.

With Alibaba's help, Hengyi Village in Zhejiang Province has managed to ride the agritourism wave in recent years. 

3. Finally, we invest in local educational and medical facilities to create the foundations for

over 450,000 tourists have visited Hengyi, stimulating the local restaurant and lodging industry, and encouraging 

people originally from Hengyi to return home and start businesses. 

“

First we deliver the world's expertise to rural areas; then we train talented young 
local people and find opportunities for them in the area; and finally we help to 
educate the rest of the local population with skills to prosper in the digital era - 
it's the basic framework of our thinking and the guide for our actions.

Putting Pinggu and her blossoms on the maps, and the apps

Alibaba has collaborated with the rural Pinggu District since October 2021 to support their rural revitalization 

efforts. Pinggu's peach blossoms across its vast expanse of peach trees are an amazing display every year. In April 

2022, we held a week-long livestreaming on our platforms so netizens could see peach trees bloom right in front of 

their screens. The event attracted over 10 million viewers and 170 million reads. The livestreaming also introduced 

folk customs and other specialties of Pinggu. We built options into our platforms such as "Pinggu One-click Smart 

Tour" and "Pinggu's Must-Travel List" for those who were inspired to visit.

Rural commissioners

Since 2019, Alibaba has sent a total of 27 rural commissioners with 

long-term postings to underdeveloped counties in China. These 

commissioners live alongside the locals and get to know the area 

intimately, both its challenges and opportunities. This allows them 

to design specialized development plans in line with local conditions 

and interests. Leveraging resources across Alibaba, they can establish 

the concepts, tools, and capabilities to develop these communities.

dispatch experienced Alibaba managers to live on site in order to craft customized local strategies. In 2021, 

we also sent out "rural technology officers" in a similar vein to tackle opportunities in digitalization.

Xinxian Ge had worked at Alibaba for 17 years before 

becoming a rural commissioner in Xunwu county, Jiangxi 

Province. When he arrived in Xunwu, he brought his 

experience with digital technology and market knowledge. 

Xinxian identified marketing as a bottleneck for locals in 

selling their goods, so one of his main projects was to 

establish a livestreaming academy, where popular Taobao 

livestreamers teach classes. As a direct result, more online 

sellers and digitally savvy farmers have been popping up in 

Xunwu. A livestream for the area's produce held by Xinxian 

and a popular livestreamer gathered over 1.6 million views, 

helping locals to sell almost five tons of passion fruit and 

cementing a brand recognition among consumers. 

Rural technology officers

We have dispatched 160 "rural technology officers," as of November 2021, to seven underdeveloped counties in 

Shanxi, Sichuan, Hebei, Hunan, and Shaanxi to explore new methods for digitally-enabled rural growth. So far, they 

have engaged in digital projects related to tree planting, tracking agricultural produce, digital governance, and 

cultural tourism. 

Rural technology officers helped build consumer trust and awareness 

with data 

Alibaba software architect Kang Han grew up in the countryside and has always wanted to find ways to help 

promote rural China. Kang volunteered for the "rural technology officer" program and was sent to Qingjian 

in Shanxi province. After surveying the area, he realized that its native high-grade, free-range black pigs had 

untapped market potential. Kang created a "five million steps" branding concept that used a digital sensor system 

to record each pig's lifetime steps. When the pork reaches Freshippo's store shelves, consumers can scan a unique 

code to access a host of information. This gave them confidence in the conditions the animals were raised in and 

created a connection with the farmers of Qingjian.

Cultivating talent and helping make rural China a 
better place to work, study, and live 

For rural regions to prosper in the long term, they need healthy and self-sustaining economies. That 

means giving employment and training opportunities to young people to help them move up the 

economic ladder. Success gives them a real choice to remain in their rural hometowns while enjoying a 

good job and a better life.

E-commerce provides opportunities for people in their
rural hometowns

Interactive livestreaming on Taobao has become an increasingly important sales channel for e-commerce. 

It also provides a platform for rural entrepreneurs to develop into online influencers, who can not only 

help themselves but often introduce their hometowns to the broader world in the process. Through our 

Hometown Initiative and our Rural Livestreaming Program, we have so far trained 110,000 people in rural 

areas to be livestreamers, and conducted 2.3 million livestreaming sessions. 

Qinglong chestnuts and e-commerce pave a new path for rural women

Chestnuts are a popular local product in the vast growing area of Qinglong, Hebei. However, local 

farmers had long been reliant on re-sellers for market access. With training from the Alibaba Foundation, 

the village has become a success story not just for e-commerce, but also for women's empowerment.

Due to traditional gender attitudes in Qinglong, most women stay at home. The first move of our rural 

commissioner Lin Liu was to create a business plan for using e-commerce to sell the local chestnuts. 

Through her efforts, the popularity of these chestnuts created a sensation throughout the province. 

She welcomed local women into a new livestreaming office, empowering many of them to introduce 

themselves to the world, building their own brands in the process. Since then, the industry has created 

600 local jobs for local women across the county, with an average salary of over RMB3,000 a month.

Digitalization is not a vast gulf to be crossed, but it is instead the key to 
women for being more independent, confident, and self-reliant.

From education to healthcare, we are making efforts to develop local human capital, essential for the 

Creating quality rural digital job opportunities – the Alibaba "Star Plan"

One of the important programs by which we have 

brought quality jobs to rural areas is through our Star 

Plan, which helps rural talent find job opportunities at 

home. As of March 31, 2022, it has covered 45 counties 

in 15 provinces, helping 9,414 people, over half with 

post-secondary degrees, to gain employment in their 

local areas by FY2022. Under this initiative, more young 

people have been able to realize their desire to find 

stable jobs without leaving their families.

By March 31, 2021, the Star 
Plan provided 9,414 direct 
jobs.

Investment in local education resources is a cornerstone of Alibaba's efforts. Over the past few years, we 

have initiated a series of projects including our "Rural Education Plan" and "Vocational Training Plan," which 

have given 610,000 rural teachers and students additional training. 

The digital economy brings professional local jobs to Xunwu

In 2020, we pioneered the "Customer Service County" model in Xunwu, Jiangxi Province. This initiative aims to 

promote digital employment opportunities for young people in rural areas through training and job creation in the 

digital service industry. As a result of this initiative, Xunwu has gained 200 direct jobs, with indirect benefits to the 

entire area. These are jobs that offer higher pay, secure benefits, and a professional life previously unavailable to 

the county. We have rolled out this program in over 45 counties.

When I first joined the project, my idea was 
simply to get a job. Then I realized that the longer 
I stayed here, the more I was able to achieve and 
grow at every step, starting from when I was on 
the front line. I was also pleasantly surprised by 
my salary. After I began managing the team, I 
was surprised by my own growth. Now that I 
am the leader of an entire site, I again surprised 
others and myself!

"Student Cloud Assistance" program to cultivate rural youths' digital capabilities

In 2021, we announced the launch of the "Student Cloud Assistance" program, which seeks to stimulate 

children's creativity and skills at an early age, and importantly, to improve their digital literacy. The program 

builds a number of cloud-based computer rooms in rural schools to provide teaching support and foster a 

culture of digital knowledge and learning. 

Rural vocational education and training

Vocational education is an important path to bridging the necessary skills to promote employment and 

entrepreneurship. When well targeted, it can be of great help in narrowing gaps in opportunities and 

incomes for regions and for individual beneficiaries. Since 2014, Alibaba has drawn on our strengths to 

actively invest in fostering local e-commerce talents and regional e-commerce businesses. By April 2022, 

we had worked alongside regional governments, enterprises, and local industrial parks to jointly build 71 

regional digital-talent training centers, with more than 800 online and offline sessions. To date, the over 

150,000 attendances garnered by our training sessions mean a lot of new local digital talents. 

"Orange Dot Students" program for rural vocational skills development

In 2021, Alibaba launched a vocational skills education platform known as "Orange Dot Students," aiming 

to help local talent develop new vocational skills. The platform offers teacher training, student practical 

training, skills certification, job recommendation, cooperative schooling, and  provides high-quality 

employment opportunities. The program has been initially implemented in the mountainous counties of 

Zhejiang and other less developed regions in China.

Providing better patient care through services on the cloud

In January 2020, China's first county-level "Cloud Medical Platform" was officially launched in Tiantai 

County, Zhejiang Province as a joint project by Tiantai County People's Hospital, Alibaba Health, and Xiniu 

Medical. This digital medical platform is based around the county's main Tiantai County People's Hospital 

and connects it with over 100 other medical establishments including township health centers and 

village clinics. The system provides more professional and effective management of the health records of 

local residents, improving their experience. It also improves the governance and operations of Tiantai's 

healthcare system. 

Helping to build up local healthcare capabilities

Rural areas must also close the gap in healthcare services. To address this, we are investing in rural medical 

capabilities and also supporting the training of rural doctors and other medical professionals.

Alibaba Rural Health Plan is one such program. Since the implementation of the plan in 2019, we have helped 

to set up 50 new clinics and provided equipment support to 574 rural clinics, which collectively serve over 

680,000 people. 

Training rural medical expertise through our "Medical Butterfly" program

Alibaba Health has joined forces with the County Hospital Presidents Alliance, the Chinese Medical Association, and the 

China Red Cross Foundation to launch a physician training platform. The project provides doctors in relatively under-

developed areas with skills training and information resources, aiming to improve the capabilities of local doctors in the 

diagnosis and treatment of common diseases, early screening for severe diseases, and improved standards of care for 

acute and severe conditions. By March 2022, the project had reached 421 county-level hospitals and conducted trainings 

for county-level hospital doctors that have registered more than 70,000 total attendances through interactive online 

exchanges and teaching programs covering a wide range of specialized topics.

resilience

Strengthening social resilience is now key to sustainable development. Alibaba seeks to build community resilience 

Building resilience into cloud services 

in three important ways. 

First, we ensure the resilience of our core systems in times of crisis, so that we can support the normal operation of 

the digital business ecosystem, which relies on our services, and to better support society after shocks. 

We take potential natural disaster risks into careful consideration when designing and constructing our data 

centers. We are actively innovating to increase the "disaster tolerance" and "fault tolerance" capabilities of 

infrastructure through the design of hardware facilities and the improvement of our overall planning. 

Second, we actively coordinate our platform ecosystem and resources to aid in disasters. 

Data center design for extreme conditions

Third, we work with stakeholders to develop joint solutions and enhance broader, durable societal resilience, 

developing a host of relevant technologies and sharing them widely.

On-site flood control and drainage

data centers can operate normally, even in 

extreme temperatures, high pressure, and power 

We make sure that our project sites are located

above the historical flood high-water mark. To 

withstand extreme weather conditions that may 

arise such as heavy rain, the rainwater in the site 

can be drained quickly through multiple channels 

such as drainage ditches, roads, and rainwater 

pipes. This ensures the safety of the site.

Power resilience

Through contingency planning and the 

installation of backup generators, our Alibaba 

Seismic resistance

We adopt the key fortification category (Class B) 

in data center design, and raised the structural 

seismic level to the first-class seismic standard.

Building resilience in logistics systems and operations

Both natural disasters and global health crises can threaten the integrity of logistics operations, causing 

supply chain issues that threaten economic production and people's lives. To protect the functioning of our 

logistics services during natural disasters, Cainiao has made extensive preparations, from the design of our 

emergency response mechanisms and resource allocation plans, to thorough employee training. 

In line with national policies, we develop emergency response mechanisms for various intensities and types 

of disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, and heavy rains. Through rigorous training of our employees, 

we ensure that in the event of a natural disaster, our team is able to rapidly respond to emergency situations. 

Cainiao has successfully built an extensive global logistics network with our international partners that 

connects hubs around the world through our smart digital technology. This network not only enhances our 

resilience as a company, but also enhances community resilience in response to disasters.

Ensuring the operational continuity of our digital 
ecosystem's core capabilities

Cloud services and supply chain logistics are essential foundations of the digital business ecosystem. They are even 

more critical in times of crisis. We are actively carrying out comprehensive assessments of natural and technical risks, 

taking seriously our responsibility to ensure stability and continuity in the core functioning of these facilities.

Responding systematically to public health crises

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, supply chains have faced numerous challenges. Our first task has 

been to protect our employees and their families, and then work to help the global community mitigate the impact 

of the public health crisis on livelihoods and the economy.

The continuity of logistics services has been of utmost importance to Alibaba since the outbreak of the pandemic 

in 2020. In cooperation with public agencies, we have strived to ensure that consumers are able to obtain daily 

necessities. Cainiao successfully deployed emergency logistics in Wuhan, Xi'an, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, Hong Kong, 

During the pandemic, we set up a special fund to supply medical supplies. Alibaba Foundation and Cainiao 

jointly established an information and logistics operation platform for medical supply procurement and 

donations, both in China and abroad. Through this initiative, we were able to successfully deliver batches 

of ventilators and PPE to people in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. In March 2022, Alibaba 

Foundation also donated HK$10 million to Hong Kong to support the pandemic prevention efforts of medical 

staff and provide them urgently needed PPE and other critical necessities.

Philanthropic 
participation of 
all employees

We want all Aliren, guided by their empathy and 

social responsibility, to channel their talents and 

creative thinking to tackle societal problems. As 

such, we have devoted significant efforts to build a 

system that inspires them to become involved and 

allows them to participate in many ways in social 

causes beyond the business. 

Every employee participates

At Alibaba, we try to build a culture where everyone regularly participates in philanthropic activities. In 

FY2022, we donated RMB550 million to the Alibaba Foundation for charitable causes. Back in 2015, we 

launched our "Three Hours for a Better World" initiative to ask all Aliren to dedicate at least three hours per 

year to social causes outside work. Aliren also band together in groups to work on a cause under the "Hugs 

and Help" umbrella. Founded in 2010, "Hugs and Help" groups now cover a number of fields including 

environmental protection, animal protection, support for senior citizens and vulnerable groups, and 

children's education, among others.

Aliren give care and support to the children of Daliang Mountain

Many children in the remote Daliang Mountains of Sichuan are so-called left-behind children, whose parents 

migrated to cities for economic reasons. The kids often face economic hardships and lack enough adult role 

models. Chunying Liu, a tech professional at Alibaba who was touched by their needs, started the "Letter 

to Kids in Daliang Mountain" project two years ago. Chunying's initiative has encouraged over 400 Alibaba 

employees to join and collectively give loving support to some 260 children. These volunteers help arrange 

regular deliveries of daily necessities, provide tuition assistance, and keep in touch with the children through a 

personal penpal system. 

“

The winter here is freezing, but I feel warm reading your letter. I hope 

that when I grow up I can be like you and also help others. Winters 

won't feel as cold that way.

Lihua Jin, a 4th grade student from Daliang Mountain 
in the letter to her Aliren penpal

Alibaba welcomes employees to take on more responsibility in many of our philanthropic efforts, contributing their 

insights on how to best leverage our technology and businesses to catalyze positive social change. A decade ago, 

Alibaba established a unique system through which every three years our employees elect a philanthropy committee 

of ten people from their own ranks. These "Alibaba philanthropic partners" actively collect feedback through daily 

engagement and regular communication with their peers and represent employees in discussions on the direction of 

Alibaba's philanthropic efforts.

2022 Alibaba Charity List of best projects:

"Digital Sign Language Interpreter"

People with hearing impairments encounter daily communication challenges. A team at DAMO Academy 

worked together to create the "Digital Sign Language Interpreter." DAMO used 3D technology to create a virtual 

sign language interpreter, "Xiao Mo," who translates spoken sentences into sign language on screen. Because 

sign language is comprised of subtle gestures and regional differences, it remains a technical challenge that 

requires continuous effort to develop and improve.

Recognition and support

The "Alibaba Charity List" was set up to recognize and reward 

outstanding internal teams, individuals, and projects that 

have made significant contributions to the public good. This 

year's recognitions focused on three categories: "Addressing 

Society's Most Pressing Issue," "Most Social Impact," and the 

"Most Technologically Innovative." More than 300 internal 

and external judges selected 10 of the most touching 

and valuable public service projects and recognized 14 

individuals. Alibaba helps incubate some of the best projects 

by setting up a RMB100 million fund. Through these mutually 

supporting programs within Alibaba, we are dedicated to 

ensuring our charity programs can grow and help these 

projects attract internal attention so that like-minded people 

can join and be inspired.

“

Technology philanthropy has become an important part of Alibaba's ESG strategy 

and is one of the main means for us to devote ourselves to public well-being. We 

are promoting technologies that "benefit everyone, are responsible, and are open 

and shared." We believe there is a lot of potential for technology firms to fulfill their 

social responsibilities.

Li Cheng, Chief Technology Officer of Alibaba

Many of the world's problems remain unaddressed not only because of a lack of resources, but because of a lack

Education for drug abuse prevention

In October 2017, Alibaba devoted funding, staff, and technological resources to developing a platform for 

online drug-use prevention education to reach students in schools. This online education system "Green 

Bridge Second Classroom" went online in June 2018, and by June 2022 it covered 31 provinces, municipalities, 

and autonomous areas, reaching 230,000 elementary and middle schools. About 106 million students have 

participated in over 900 million hours of online classes learning about the dangers of drug use. In June 2020, 

"Green Bridge Second Classroom" was awarded as a National Exemplary Organization in Anti-Drug Efforts.

areas such as data gathering, data processing, and visualization, we help improve information flow and resource 

coordination in this critical effort. 

By June 2022 

Technology for recovering missing children

For certain social issues, spreading information quickly is crucial. This is exemplified by the distressing cases of 

missing children. To address this problem, Alibaba helped build the "Reunion System." When a new case of a 

missing child is reported by authorities, the Reunion System broadcasts the child's information across 25 popular 

apps to users who are near the child's last known whereabouts, with the alert radius expanding 100km with each 

passing hour. As of May 15, 2022, the Reunion System had sent out alerts for 5,038 missing children's cases and 

assisted in the recovery of 4,960 of them. In the last program year alone, we assisted in the recovery of 253 missing 

children.1 Nearly 200 Aliren from across 16 business units voluntarily devoted their skills and time to developing and 

maintaining the system.

We also run a parallel effort for 

children who have been missing 

for longer periods. We launched 

the Amap "Family Search" function 

that displays the 5,005 free blood 

collection points across the country 

that help to perform genetic 

matches. "Family Search" has 

helped in the recovery of more than 

ten thousand missing children.

Alibaba recognizes the critical role of non-profits and social entrepreneurs in driving wider and positive 

societal change. Therefore, we are committed to augmenting their capabilities by sharing free, accessible, and 

affordable technological solutions and services.

Digital

Innovation

Connecting charities with tech know-how

In 2017, Alibaba Cloud engineers created a technical volunteer service platform, "Green Code," to help non-profits 

with technical needs connect with skilled tech volunteers. As of the release date of this report, more than 330 non-

profit organizations and more than 6,000 volunteer programmers have registered. In 2021, Alibaba collaborated with 

19 non-profit organizations to jointly launch the "Green Code Camp Low Coding Challenge." Over 300 tech volunteers 

used simplified and easy-to-manage software code to develop management applications for over 20 charity 

projects,  supporting the digital transformation of these organizations.

Streamlining the Amity Foundation through the power of code

The Amity Foundation, established 36 years ago, is an influential public fundraising charity, which has worked with over 

600 partners and benefited over 10 million people. However, it was still relying on traditional time-consuming office 

processes such as manually filled Excel spreadsheets. Digitization enabled by our "Green Code" platform streamlined 

their processes, increasing operational efficiency, and freeing up time for their most important work.

"Charities on the Chain" tracks the flow of donations 
for fundraising trust

We are helping non-profit organizations improve transparency in their operations so as to build public 

trust and boost fundraising. To do so, we shared our blockchain technology to establish a public-service 

standard for tracking donations. During the 2020 International Week of Charity in September, Alibaba 

Foundation launched the first group standard in China for "Public Service Blockchain Technology and 

Application Specification." As of March 2021, every public charitable donation via Alibaba platforms 

had been registered on the system. This facilitates trust-building by ensuring the transparency of each 

donation allocation.

Support program for philanthropies

Since March 2021, our "XIN 100" program has sought to provide all-around support to nurture and assist 

philanthropic projects whose work aligns with Alibaba's ESG and philanthropic priorities. At this stage, 

we have set five major areas for "XIN 100" to target: rural revitalization, care for seniors and people with 

disabilities, helping children, environmental protection, and safety and emergency response. "XIN 100" 

aims to identify at least 100 major projects every year and bring together a wide range of resources to 

facilitate their implementation. In FY2022, the "XIN 100" project supported a total of 85 projects from 49 

charitable organizations.

our platforms

Alibaba's spirit of philanthropy reflects the saying "many hands make light work." As a platform operator, we 

have the unique ability to develop this type of philanthropy by leveraging our platforms to build volunteering 

and funding channels that rally everyone together and embed social consciousness in everyday life.

“

The 'Goods for Good' Program offers merchants like us a great opportunity 

to go from being just a donor to building up our own philanthropic creed by 

connecting with charitable causes that share common inspiration with us.

Xiaochun Hua, Head of Philanthropy at Florasis

By integrating commerce, technology, and philanthropy, the program is convenient for donors and makes 

it easier for participating charities to not only raise new funds but to familiarize new donors with their 

organizations and projects. Over the past 15 years, more than 8 million merchants have participated in the 

”

program, with 47.3 billion orders channeling charitable proceeds to programs that have benefited 43 million 

people. In FY2022 alone, the program saw more than 500 million consumers and 2.2 million merchants 

participating.

"Goods for Good" program helps "left-behind" children 

The "Companion Mother" project was started by the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation in order to 

provide more adult influences for "left-behind children" whose parents migrated to cities for jobs. The project 

operates on the principle of "one mother; one family; one bond," whereby professional full-time "mothers" 

in each village coordinate the creation of a supportive "family" unit using funds from the project and other 

sources. To support this project, Tmall's childcare products channel provided fundraising via the "Goods for 

Good" program. For every item purchased through the channel that is marked with a "Companion Mother" 

label, a small portion of the proceeds goes towards the "Companion Mother" project. Over RMB10 million 

was raised for the project in two years, supporting the creation of sponsor "families" in over 200 villages, and 

improving the lives of nearly 170,000 children.

Platform-based innovations in participatory philanthropy

Fundraising is a perennial challenge for many 

charities, while the public often perceives a lack 

of convenient and credible channels to make 

donations. Alibaba's "Goods for Good" is one 

program that targets both problems by giving 

merchants the ability to designate and label 

selected products where a portion of proceeds 

goes to a verified charitable cause. In line with our 

participatory approach, this "check-out" donation 

program aims to integrate social consciousness into 

regular shopping and touch a wide swath of people 

in a transparent way.

"Goods for Good" donations since inception

Inspired by the "Companion Mother" project, Alibaba and other merchants on our platform began to focus 

on how to help left-behind rural mothers and children more generally. On April 15, 2021, the Tmall childcare 

products channel led hundreds of thousands of sellers to start the "China Mothers' Philanthropy Initiative," 

bringing together the resources of the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation, the Amity Foundation, the 

Chunhui Children's Foundation, and other organizations to gain supports for pregnant mothers and children 

under fourteen in underprivileged areas.

Diverse opportunities for philanthropic participation 

The "Three Hours for A Better World" public service platform opens up a variety of ways to engage citizens in 

social causes, such as volunteering, livestreaming for fundraising, blood donations, and charitable purchases 

or direct giving. The platform has specific programs to tackle pressing issues such as poverty alleviation, 

environmental protection, and pandemic relief. For example, our initiative "Purchase to Help" promotes  

sale of rural products from poorer regions. Through these programs and more, we have made it easier for 

individuals to do daily acts of good, already with more than a billion instances of participation.

Encouraging and recognizing participation

Alibaba wants to make it easy not only to give opportunities for public service but also give recognition for 

such service. We have developed a personal "charity account" that is the only one currently authorized by 

China's National Civil Affairs Department. We worked with Zhejiang province to launch a charity account for 

the province. Users can upload, track, and verify their public service across different projects and charities, 

with the potential to obtain rewards and incentives for their service. We are also working in cooperation 

with over ten fundraising charities, including Easy Philanthropy and Moving Together, to jointly develop 

the Guidelines on Measuring Charitable Contribution with the Chinese Volunteer Organization and the 

Hangzhou Philanthropic Association.

Transforming footsteps into running tracks for young athletes

"Donating Footsteps" on our Taobao app is all it takes to help nurture a potential Olympic athlete. On June 

23, 2021, the Winter Olympic Organizing Committee, together with the Alibaba Foundation and the China 

Poverty Alleviation Foundation announced the "Saving Every Loving Step" 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics 

philanthropy project. Volunteers who tracked their daily step count were able to accumulate funds to build 

running tracks at rural schools. By March 2022, over 150 million people had taken part.

"Goods for Good" sends "Panda Packs" to support children in less developed countries

In 2019, the Alibaba Foundation and the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation jointly launched the "Panda 

Pack Project" to send care packages with useful school or household items to children in less developed countries. 

As of this year, the project has already received over 2.6 billion individual donations. A total of RMB128 million 

from "Goods for Good" have been raised for programs in Myanmar, Nepal, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Laos, Pakistan, 

Namibia, Uganda, Mongolia, the Philippines, and Zimbabwe, benefiting over 1 million children. The "Panda Pack 

Project" is one of the largest international charitable initiatives organized by the non-government sector in China. 

In 2021, it was recognized as the best poverty relief case at the Global Solicitation on Best Poverty Reduction 

Practices (Second Call).

Engaging the public in diverse forms of philanthropic 
participation 

To encourage wider public participation in philanthropy, especially beyond just donating money, we have 

further leveraged our platform to offer the public rich and diverse opportunities to participate in philanthropy. 

"Three Hours for a Better World" 
becomes an open platform for social good

Following the success of our internal "Three Hours for A Better World" for Aliren, we expanded the program 

to the general public on China Charity Day in 2017. Four years later, the program saw more than 150 million 

registered participants. Through this program, different charity organizations and public service programs are 

now getting connected directly with people who want to help.

Upholding a high level of business ethics is a requirement for every employee, who must commit to conducting 

Our legal compliance team routinely conducts anti-

their work with compliance, integrity, and in good faith. We are equally committed to ethical practices that 

corruption risk assessments according to relevant 

maintain fairness, trust, and openness on our platforms and beyond. 

Anti-corruption
Since 2009, we have successively formulated a set of rules such as the "Alibaba Group Code of Business Conduct," 

"Alibaba Group Employee Disciplinary Guidelines," "Alibaba Group Conflict of Interest Guidelines and Interpretations," 

"Alibaba Group Gifts Handling Guidelines," and the "Alibaba Group Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy." These 

codes and policies give guidance to employee behavioral norms and facilitate the company’s integrity culture. These 

requirements  are constantly updated and optimized in accordance with compliance requirements and business needs.

Management system

At the management level, we have set up an independent Integrity Compliance Department, which is responsible for 

corruption investigations, prevention, and educational training. The Integrity Compliance Department reports directly 

to the Deputy Chief People Officer of Alibaba Group. It also maintains functional independence from other risk 

control departments such as internal audit and internal control of Alibaba Group. This setup forms a multiple lines of 

defense mechanism in which functional units can cooperate with each other.

We also incorporate the integrity of the team into the performance appraisal of each business manager. In the 

"Alibaba Group Code of Business Conduct" and other internal policies, we require the accountability of managers if 

fraudulent accidents occur in their teams. These efforts make corruption prevention and anti-corruption results core 

performance indicators in the company's internal management.

Finally, we encourage all employees, business partners, and the public to report instances of corruption and fraud 

involving Alibaba personnel. We have established many reporting channels, including the official website and 

dedicated e-mail accounts, and hotlines, among others. We also ensure the whistleblower's personal information 

and reported content remain confidential within the scope permitted by laws and regulations.

For Alibaba, the fundamental prerequisite for earning the trust of our service providers, customers, and other 

stakeholders hinges on how we protect their privacy and secure their data. This is why privacy protection and 

data security are a cornerstone of our ESG strategy. 

Our privacy and security value proposition
We launched China's first Data Protection Initiative as early as July 2015, advocating for various cloud providers, 

including Alibaba Cloud, to adopt and follow these three principles to protect the privacy and security of our 

business customers:

You own your data

Data of developers, companies, governments and other institutions being stored 
and processed on cloud computing platforms shall be owned by the customers. The 
cloud computing platforms shall not use such data for other purposes.

You manage your data

Cloud computing platforms have the responsibility and obligation to help ensure 
data confidentiality, integrity, and availability for customers. We store customer 
data  in  their  selected  data  center,  and  protect  their  business  information  in 
accordance with the applicable legal provisions.

Your data is protected

On Alibaba Cloud's computing platform, customers fully own their business data, 
as  well  as  the  ownership  and  rights  of  their  user  data.  Alibaba  Cloud  strictly 
executes customer instructions to process their business data, and will not make 
any unauthorized use or disclosure, except in accordance with customer agreement 
or for the need to implement legal and regulatory requirements.

Security technology and capacities
Privacy protection and data security are not guaranteed by any single technology but should be 

considered as a sophisticated interconnected system that requires careful design. We have built a full 

range of data security capabilities from physical computer rooms to IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), 

where we control the security risks through securing the storage, network, and computing, and then our 

PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) layers to create a trustworthy and secure 

environment. We have taken measures in these areas.

Data storage and protection

Network data security

We adopt the strategy of combining local data 

To provide an extra layer of security against 

backup and off-site data backup. We back up 

attackers and eavesdroppers, we encrypt the 

network data to local storage in real time, and 

data transmission process on the cloud. For 

regularly back up important network data to off-

this data transmission encryption on the cloud, 

site storage. We use auto-recovery, encryption, and 

we protect not only the data "warehouse" but 

other procedures to ensure data writing stability, 

also the data "logistics," meaning the content 

storage media management, and redundant data 

delivery network (CDN). Alibaba Cloud has 

backup protection, and have established a complete 

more than 2,800 CDN nodes, covering 34 

cloud data redundancy mechanism to ensure that 

provincial-level regions in China and in six 

customers will not lose their data, ensuring resilience 

continents around the world, with industry-

in case of accidents or malicious attacks.

leading performance. 

Computational security

Creating a trusted computing environment from hardware to software is another security mechanism 

we implement to guarantee the inviolability of computing security for our clients. As early as 2018, we 

released the trusted cloud hardware security architecture, becoming the earliest cloud vendor in the 

Asia Pacific region to build trusted computing and confidential computing. 

We provide customers with a full range of data protection through confidential computing capabilities 

across three layers: hardware, virtualization, and application. We also deploy a variety of automated 

protection tools.

Alibaba Cloud helps the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics run on the cloud

Alibaba Cloud undertook the historic assignment of supporting the first fully cloud-based Winter 

Olympic Games in 2022. Our "Olympic Broadcasting Cloud" supported more than 6,000 hours of 

streamed and broadcast digital content, and maintained the digital infrastructure against security holes 

and malicious attacks. We achieved zero intrusion and zero data leaks.

/ 2022Environmental, Social, and Governance ReportBuilding TrustChairman's LetterExecutive SummaryEnvironmentConsumersCommunityPhilanthropyTrustEmployeesSmallBusinessesSecurity management system

Governance structure and rules

Beyond our efforts in security technology, it is equally vital that we have principles and processes for data security 

management. To that end, we have set up a specialized data security decision-making group within our Risk 

Management Committee. This effort is replicated within each business unit with a "Personal Information Protection 
Officer" (PIPO).2

In hosting the data for millions of organizations, Alibaba Cloud strictly abides by the principle of least privilege and 

adopts consistent management and control standards to protect customer data from unauthorized access. 

To give full transparency to our security processes, we initiated the following three mechanisms：

Third party 
oversight

Personal information 
protection

Product privacy 
protection

We implemented a mechanism for 
third-party supervision and user 
experience feedback.

We established the Personal Information 
Protection Expert Committee, composed 
of professionals in law, technology, and 
other relevant fields.

Inviting users and customers to 
evaluate their experience of the 
privacy protection functions of 
Alibaba's products and services.

Transparent internal operation & maintenance (O&M) 

In the Data Protection Initiative, Alibaba Cloud has clearly stated the principle that customer business data 

hosted on the cloud platform is absolutely owned by the customer, and that it should never use such data. 

Under our "notification-consent" principle, we have established transparent internal operational O&M logs. 

Customers have access to all of their internal logs, giving them a full disclosure of data access and ensuring 

there is no "black box" concerning the use of their data.

Recognitions and compliance

In the 2021 Gartner Solution Scorecard for integrated IaaS and PaaS, Alibaba Cloud achieved the highest scores in the 

core security criteria assessment. Alibaba Cloud's six security capabilities (DDoS protection, web application firewall, 

cloud security center, cloud firewall, business risk control, and confidential computing) have been recognized by 

authoritative institutions around the world.

We strive to comply with and enforce all international and domestic laws and regulations related to data security and 

privacy protection, and establish an internal data security control system. Our protocols are widely recognized within 

the industry, especially in platform data control and customer data protection. We possess the most authoritative and 

compliant set of qualifications in the Asia-Pacific region. Some of those qualifications are listed in the following tables.

Materiality Assessment 

Our material issues encompass what matters most to our business, ESG goals, and stakeholders. Maintaining 

awareness of these issues is critical for identifying and managing our risks and opportunities and effectively 

responding to stakeholder expectations.

Approach and process

In 2022, under the supervision of Alibaba Group's sustainability steering committee, we carried out a materiality 

assessment. Through benchmarking analysis and stakeholders engagement, we selected 22 strategic issues 

conducive to creating sustainable shared values and constructed our materiality matrix. 

1. Identifying issues and benchmarking

We first generate a long list of potentially material topics, using the expertise of our external advisors, 

relevant sustainability frameworks (including GRI and SASB), requirements by stock exchanges (including 

the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, HKEx), recommendations from rating agencies, domestic and international 

policies (including the SDGs), and peers best practices, as well as Alibaba's business.

2. Re ining

We carried out further analysis to refine the long list of issues and generate a short list of 22 issues. Our 

analysis comprised consolidation among the long-listed issues and further assessment on the topics’ direct 

relevance for our businesses, as well as the relevant trends and events related to specific issues.

3. Stakeholder engagement processes

To understand the views of key stakeholders in the short-listed issues, we conducted a series of internal 

and external engagement and communications activities, including interviews and surveys. We also use 

existing stakeholder communication channels to provide additional support information.

4. Prioritization and materiality matrix

We analyze stakeholder feedback to understand the importance of each topic to them; similarly, we also

analyze the importance of each issue to Alibaba's business and sustainable development strategy. We 

use the results of the importance assessment to generate a materiality matrix. Based on the degree of 

importance of each issue to stakeholders and to ourselves, we classified the issues into four categories: 

prioritize; continue internal efforts; sustain and communicate; monitor, comply, and manage.

The results of the materiality assessment reflect the most important ESG issues faced by our value chain and 

platform ecosystem stakeholders. While placing issues in a matrix provides insight into our priorities, the 

relative importance of individual issues often varies by business unit, geographic region, and stakeholder 

group.

Progress of United Nations Global Compact

As one of the world's most influential corporate sustainability initiatives, the UN Global Compact requires 

companies to conduct themselves as "corporate citizens," calling on them to comply with the ten fundamental 

principles related to human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption, and to take action to advance the 

implementation of social and sustainable development goals. More than 9,500 companies and 3,000 non-

business signatories from more than 160 countries have joined the UN Global Compact. Alibaba became a 

party to the UN Global Compact in February 2021. Our Chairman and CEO, Daniel Zhang, continues to support 

UNGC and its principles. We take a responsible, principles-based, and integrated approach and are commited

Our vision: We aspire to be a good company that will last for 102 years.

Our mission: to make it easy to do business anywhere.

Our founders started our company to champion small businesses, in the belief that the Internet would level the playing eld by enabling small enterprises to leverage innovation and technology to grow and compete more e ectively in domestic and global economies.

We believe that concentrating on customer needs and solving their problems whether those customers are consumers, merchants, or enterprises ultimately will lead to the best outcome for our business.

In the digital era, we are staying true to our mission by helping our customers and business partners harness the power of digital technology.

We have developed an ecosystem powered by technology infrastructure that enables participants to create and share value on our platforms.

Our decisions are guided by how they serve our mission over the long term, not by the pursuit of short term gains.

Our vision: we aspire to be a good company that will last for 102 years.

For a company that was founded in 1999, lasting for 102 years means we will have spanned three centuries.

Our culture, business models, and systems are built to last, so that we can achieve sustainability in the long run.

As we continue to expand our businesses, Alibaba has evolved into an ecosystem that is unique, energetic, and innovative.

ESG not only provides a framework for tackling a series of global challenges, but is also the bridge to carry Alibaba to 102 years and beyond.

The extreme weather this summer is fueling global anxiety that the impact of climate change is not far removed in the future.

Historical data shows that each decade since the 1960s has been hotter than the previous.

Yet extreme weather is but one example of a world facing increasing uncertainty.

The COVID pandemic is now in its third year, while geopolitical con icts continue to intensify alongside emerging energy and food crises.

Goals (SDGs), such as eradicating poverty, reducing inequality, and mitigating climate change, does not warrant optimism.

Alibaba's vision is to be a good company that will last for 102 years.

We were founded in 1999, and 102 years would give us a foothold across three centuries.

This will require resilience to overcome major economic cycles and unexpected challenges.

Our original vision is a testament to this long term thinking, and shows our commitment to addressing issues faced by our communities and to creating value beyond only commercial outcomes.

For us to last for 102 years in a healthy and sustainable fashion, we must manage our impact on the environment, our relationship with society at large, and our long term corporate governance.

We believe the e ective implementation of ESG strategies should align with both global standards and China's practices.

Carbon), common prosperity, rural revitalization, and educational equity, which are highly consistent with the action items advocated by the SDGs and o er guidance for exploring value creation beyond commercial outcomes.

We believe ESG designs and practices in China will evolve to incorporate unique local characteristics.

We believe in our responsibility and capability to be a driver of positive change more than ever.

As a digital platform company, Alibaba's growth story is a history of innovation in the business applications of technology and the creation of new business formats with the many participants in our ecosystem.

Today our digital platforms have brought together more than 1.3 billion consumers and tens of millions of merchants and other organizations.

How to work with them to build a green and sustainable new business ecosystem and create value beyond commercial outcomes is a new expedition for all of us.

Of course, solving all these challenges and building a new business ecosystem is not something that can be done overnight, nor can any organization do it independently.

It requires the trust and collaboration of all stakeholders, including policymakers, businesses, and the general public all working together to discover innovative sustainable solutions.

Restoring our green planet: Addressing major environmental issues such as climate change.

Supporting our people: Building a people rst culture that o ers an equal, inclusive, and digni ed environment in which every employee can grow and develop.

Enabling a sustainable digital life: Leveraging the power of technology to bring a better and more responsible digital lifestyle for everyone.

The design of our ESG strategy is critical to the realization of this vision.

Fueling small businesses: Creating more growth opportunities for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and framework to address universal risks and challenges but is also increasingly important as a global standard for entrepreneurs through technology and business innovations.

Last year, we formally announced that ESG would become a core pillar of Alibaba’s strategies.

Enhancing community inclusion and resilience: Sharing dividends of development with disadvantaged groups and underserved regions, and thus building more inclusive and resilient communities.

Facilitating participatory philanthropy: Fostering a culture of participatory philanthropy by integrating community and risk in the 79 years ahead and beyond.

It helps us develop a practical, clear, and persistent action plan with high quality and transparent metrics for continuous self evaluation and improvement.

We will share our progress through two reports: our Annual Report on the health of our business, and the ESG report on our progress in sustainability and the associated value we create.

Building corporate and social trust: Building corporate trust by establishing an e ective, transparent, and sound governance system building social trust with ethical technology and protecting user privacy and data security.

Over the past year, I have spent a lot of time working closely with our teams on Alibaba's ESG strategies and with compliance, transparency, and accountability.

At the beginning of this month, we announced two action plan, which has been my top priority.

To guide our strategy and execution, we are building a three tier new independent directors, bringing the total number of independent directors on our board to seven governance structure consisting of the sustainability committee at the board level, the sustainability steering out of twelve, or more than 50 percent, and the number of female board members to three.

We will committee (SSC) for management oversight, and the ESG working group.

We are proud that every bit of our progress in ESG has been inextricably connected with the economic and social growth of people's daily lives.

We are actively exploring how to use technology to better serve our ESG objectives, how to better integrate ESG into our business design, and how to promote public welfare more e ectively and sustainably in various social topics, such as ghting pandemics and natural disasters or supporting longer term endeavors including common prosperity, rural development, and Chinese cultural preservation.

Our e orts in addressing these topics help us develop a deeper understanding of our relationship with our times and the society we are in.

In December 2021, we released our Carbon Neutrality Action Report and made some important commitments.

These commitments will continue to impact generations of Alibaba employees, or Aliren.

Despite the many challenges ahead, we are hopeful.

The world is full of uncertainties and we are at a critical juncture for a new phase in sustainable development.

Under these circumstances, ESG is not just the right choice but also an opportunity to shape the future.

We will publish this ESG report annually to share periodic updates on our goals, actions, and progress.

We believe digitalization can not only bring connectivity and synergy, but also uniquely drive green transformation and sustainable change will only come with ongoing e orts across generations.

By now, carbon reduction is a priority across development.

We have pioneered methodologies for measuring Scope 3 emissions reduction with leading institutions and started industry collaborations with consumer companies on decarbonization friendly actions.

We have also recently rolled out a carbon ledger platform to make it easier for users across Alibaba’s ecosystem to participate in eco friendly actions.

As a general principle, we strive to make low carbon e orts go hand in hand with long term development.

Meanwhile, we have started to incorporate broader environmental commitments into future planning, including on water, natural resources, and biodiversity.

We also believe that the boundaries of social responsibility should be broader.

To begin with, we are committed to creating an equal, inclusive, and digni ed working environment for our employees, providing them with growth opportunities as well as fair and reasonable compensation and bene ts.

We are leveraging technology to support the high quality development of small businesses and the creation of inclusive and exible employment opportunities at scale while enabling more consumers to access a sustainable lifestyle.

We are contributing to building a digital rural economy and improving community resilience to combat pandemics and natural disasters.

We are promoting a culture of participatory philanthropy, which means charitable actions and social impact e orts can be in uential in addressing sustainable development challenges beyond business goals.

We are also continuing to pursue corporate governance excellence and earn the long term trust of consumers, customers, and other stakeholders.

We are leveraging industry leading technologies and capabilities to help build a trust system for digital business, including secure protection of user privacy and data security.

We hope the implementation of our ESG strategy will make Alibaba a better company.

The world collectively faces a host of issues that threaten our society's future, with the most pressing twin challenges being environmental degradation and socioeconomic inequality.

These risks are urgent and of a magnitude that puts them beyond the capacity of any singular institution or even country to address.

Understanding the scale and complexity of these challenges, the global community is coming together and engaging in concerted e orts.

For Alibaba, ESG is the bridge to carry us into a long term and sustainable future.

We are, after all, a company born with social responsibility in our DNA.

That begins with our mission to make it easy to do business anywhere.

Our platforms have helped over ten million small businesses to thrive and over a billion consumers to enjoy better lives.

To continue to make such contributions, Alibaba must do all it can to mitigate key societal challenges, for the long term sustainability of ourselves, our partners, and our communities at large.

Initiative, recommending that our business partners and industry peers, together with us, should: prosperity, and rural revitalization), and the budding corporate ESG movement.

As a technology driven platform company in this era, Alibaba should shoulder the responsibility to help mitigate these challenges.

Practice sustainable development in business activities and be transparent in ESG disclosure across the world.

We must bring to bear the full force of digital innovation, while also ensuring that every person and community that we serve can fully enjoy its bene ts.

In our view, there are three pillars prioritizing social responsibility, leveraging the strength of technology, and engaging the stakeholder ecosystem that serve as indispensable building blocks for systematic, scalable, and collaborative solutions to sustainability challenges.

Businesses touch upon all three pillars and should help gather these forces to identify solutions that align with the public interest.

Digital platforms are especially well positioned to link the three building blocks to create ecosystems, both for business and beyond, that are technology powered and socially responsible.

Commit to delivering on long term sustainable development objectives to ensure a better future for businesses, communities, countries, and the planet.

By December 2021, we had codi ed our recommendations into a robust system, declaring ESG as one of Alibaba's top priorities in our business strategies and future growth.

On that basis, we are championing responsible technology, and committing to the inseparable link between our own future and a sustainable future for all.

In designing our ESG strategy based on the three pillars social responsibility, technological strength, and multiple stakeholder engagement we have developed a systematic ve step approach to position, integrate, coordinate, amplify, and complement our ESG goals.

Positioning and targeting: Through extensive communication with relevant stakeholders such as consumers, employees, investors, governments, partners, and communities, and considering the most pressing societal challenges and Alibaba’s own characteristics and capabilities, we have identi ed the issues of greatest priority.

We have further clari ed our strategic positioning with ESG as central to our core strategy, and we are committed to being a technology company that promotes human well being and protects the planet, so that people and nature can develop in a sustainable way.

Integrating ESG into business design: Only by establishing social responsibility as a core element of business design, combined with technological and business innovations, can sustainability truly become the engine of enterprise development.

When the global COVID 19 pandemic struck, our immediate priority was to protect our people.

We developed a new set of digital procedures to minimize the risk of employees catching the virus, while at the same time aiming to minimize disruption to their work and lives.

First, we aimed to be responsive and took stricter measures to protect our people.

We developed the internal health system Tenzo Pass Code to allow employees to report on their health status during the outbreak, helping us to identify potential risks.

Moreover, we provided medical supplies to employees, including distributing personal protection equipment (PPE), setting up COVID testing and vaccination stations in convenient locations, and establishing rules for the use of public facilities within our offices in order to minimize risks to our employees.

Lastly, when there was a shortage of supplies for certain regions, we sent affected employees and their families food items and health supplies.

We also provide professional and targeted health benefits according to the needs of employees, such as care for women and children, free health clinics (including free Chinese medicine clinics), and other activities.

The company operates 24 canteens and dining halls across our campuses, with healthy and nutritious food offerings covering a variety of cuisines.

They often provide seasonal foods and special holiday meals.

The campuses are full of fruit shops, convenience stores, milk tea shops, and coffee and dessert shops, giving employees places to meet and socialize.

The existing Fun Clubs include outdoor sports, photography, film, dance, music, basketball, board games, and drama, among others.

All the initiatives are led by individual employees in areas they are passionate about.

We provide funding and support for a wide range of team building and social activities, which are an integral part of life at Alibaba.

Alibaba Fun Clubs are interest clubs led by employees.

Our 42 Alibaba Fun Clubs together boasted over 41,000 registered members in FY2022.

Among our Fun Clubs, we have competitive sports such as basketball, football, badminton, and kendo, as well as arts societies such as photography, film, music, painting, and drama.

We also have more specialized societies such as different book clubs and game clubs.

Outside of working hours, there are always groups of people enjoying each other's company.

We have programmers moonlighting as song writers, business operators dabbling in street dancing, and designers who become champions on a basketball court.

Bringing Aliren together for living seriously is what our Fun Clubs are all about.

On May 10, 2003, all Aliren were forced to stay at home due to the SARS outbreak.

They braved difficulties and fought tenaciously, with tremendous support from their families.

May 10th then became the day we celebrate the Alibaba spirit.

Since 2005, to commemorate Aliren's dedication, unity, faith, and love, and give everyone an opportunity to come together, we have celebrated the day as AliDay.

Across global campuses, the day features a series of activities to bring together our people and their families and friends to experience our vibrant culture firsthand, and to express our appreciation for family members.

The highlight of the day is a group wedding celebration in which couples who recently tied the knot can share the blessings of their special day with family, friends, and colleagues.

Customers First is Alibaba's eternal belief no matter how the world changes.

The support of our customers gives us the strength and courage to pursue our dreams.

Starting from 2015, Alibaba has designated September 10th, the anniversary of our founding, as our annual Customer Day.

The day was established to encourage employees and partners to focus on the customer.

The care and safety of our employees is our paramount concern.

We have established and honed a comprehensive safety and security system that is designed to effectively respond to natural disasters, serious accidents, dangers to health, and threats to public safety, ensuring the health of our employees and safe operation of our business.

The health and safety of employees is our foremost concern.

So we engage the 'chivalrous spirit' of Aliren, combined with professional safety instruction and mutual assistance, and encourage our employees to volunteer as fire marshals and first aid responders.

To be able to help oneself and others is the Alibaba way.

The first line of defense in any emergency is having the American Heart Association to educate and people nearby to help.

We have implemented enable our employees to better help each other a series of practical training programs.

We have as first responders, shortening the crucial period life saving automatic external defibrillator (AED) between an injury and medical treatment.

The fire machines installed at 81 campuses across the marshals are an integral part of our emergency country and conduct regular first aid drills and fire response force, and also help with our efforts in drills.

In FY2022, we held 430 fire drills and 431 disseminating emergency knowledge, organizing first aid drills.

As of the end of FY2022, approximately 1,100 look after the safety of themselves and others, employees had completed training as fire marshals, since 2018 we have trained groups of volunteers and 1,700 had done so as first aid responders.

For program has resulted in Hangzhou Xixi Campus the training of first aid responders, we partner being recognized as a model first aid training site with Alibaba Health, the Chinese Red Cross, and by Hangzhou Municipality.

We aim to help our customers live a better digital life and make their consumption more sustainable.

Enabling a Sustainable Digital Life 2022Environmental, Social, and Governance ReportChairman's LetterExecutive SummaryEnvironmentConsumersCommunityPhilanthropyTrustEmployeesSmallBusinessesTrustExecutive SummaryEnvironmentCommunityPhilanthropyEmployeesSmallBusinessesChairman's LetterTrust As a leading global digital consumer platform, it is our responsibility to be clear about what sustainable consumption should be and what we can do to make it possible.

In this regard, the United Nation's SDGs help define sustainable consumption by balancing the enhancement of individual well being with the need for social responsibility.

Eradicating hunger is the most basic foundation for attaining these goals, and the next level of support is enabling everyone to improve their health and well being as they see fit.

This better life requires that people be able to access products and services for their diverse needs.

It also entails that consumers trust their suppliers, including with the protection of their privacy and data security.

Finally, consumption must not harm the environment and society.

All of this means that consumers should be able to consume in diverse, inclusive, trustworthy, and environmentally and socially responsible ways.

Attaining these goals remains a daunting prospect.

Some people's fulfillment of basic needs are still on the rise, while others are now focused on product quality, variety, and experiences.

We believe that digital technology provides unprecedented potential in delivering the goal of a more diverse, inclusive, and responsible life for everyone.

The archaeological discoveries of Sanxingdui in Sichuan province have amazed the world and inspired a popular fascination for archaeology.

For us, diverse consumption means increasing the range of possibilities for a better life.

Getting the products one needs when they are needed is a critical component of a better life.

This anytime, strive to help customers enjoy the best products at the quality they expect.

This starts with offering the brands that anywhere experience was once only available to the affluent, but now through our technical and logistics they want.

We provide services including nearly instant, half day, same day, or next day delivery options, as well as next day pick up services.

In areas traditionally underserved by brick and mortar retailers, a world of choice is suddenly on people's doorsteps.

Ultimately, we wish for more of our users to have access to the instant consumption experience.

Alibaba platforms provide consumers with delivery choices matching their needs for product releases and sales.

The annual Tmall 618 (June 18) sales festival has become increasingly regarded as a focal point in their sales strategies.

In 2022, more than 200 major international brands participated in Tmall 618, with over 300 new products selling out on the first day.

Our platforms open the world to Chinese consumers who can effortlessly experience the latest products from global brands.

Our platforms open doors for the fast rising China chic brands.

Their development now gives consumers around the world more and better choices.

On our platforms, MSMEs with their many distinctive products can now reach consumers globally.

For consumers, this is an era in which the niche, boutique, and varied are increasingly accessible.

Tmall Global, which bring the best of the world to Chinese consumers, has been lowering barriers for new sellers and helping overseas small brands to flourish in the large China market.

Alibaba Health has created an integrated online and offline sales channel for medical diagnostics and drug purchases.

In addition, the entire process of seeing a doctor or other medical professional, previously involving queues and waits, is now available online, including registration, appointments, follow up consultations, and home delivery.

We are also expanding our offline services, endeavoring to have partnered pharmacies available to all our users.

An important mission of our business is to help consumers attain the best value for their money, which is especially crucial to those aspiring to a better life.

We give full play to the advantages of digital platforms to provide consumers with cost effective goods and services.

We identify high quality manufacturers and assist them in planning and producing cost effective goods with our market insights.

We also continuously improve efficiencies across a vast warehousing and fulfillment network.

We try to bring more value to more diverse consumers through new business models.

For instance, Taobao Deals enables manufacturers and brands to sell directly to consumers to meet their needs for value for money products.

In FY2022, Taobao Deals passed the 300 million user milestone.

We also provide consumers with convenient money saving functionalities.

Find Similar function, allowing consumers to compare prices conveniently with similar goods.

We launched a Price Guarantee feature, whereby consumers may apply for a price difference refund on certain guaranteed goods if the price drops in the subsequent 90 days.

Lazada introduces same day delivery services in Manila, the Philippines equitable market for our consumers.

In November 2021, Lazada Philippines formally rolled out same day delivery in Manila.

Before then, consumers generally expected a fulfillment cycle of 3 to 5 days.

Our new service greatly improved convenience for Filipino shoppers.

Through Taocaicai, consumers in less affluent and remote regions can enjoy variety and value for many goods that were previously inaccessible to them.

Taocaicai has built a pool of more than 700 domestic and global agricultural direct procurement bases to offer over 1 million quality products.

While Taocaicai often operates in locations with less developed infrastructure, it builds its warehouses to strict standards, with temperature controlled storage rooms to help reduce waste and guarantee the freshness and safety of goods.

One of our central aims is to ensure the benefits of the modern digital economy are accessible to all.

To ensure that no one is left behind, we pay special attention to bringing the possibility of a better consumer life to underdeveloped areas, especially rural and remote areas, as well as to groups often facing digital challenges, including senior citizens, people living with disabilities, and others.

This progress has relied on the small town and rural logistics infrastructure we have put great effort into building, which enables us to bring modern commerce to remote areas that often face higher transport costs, lower density, and generally poorer commercial infrastructure.

By March 31, 2022, Cainiao had close to 50,000 village stations across the country.

These service capabilities and multi party logistics companies are making a difference in consumers' daily lives, narrowing the digital gap with urban households.

The village of Yangla in Yunnan Province is surrounded by the snow capped Hengduan Mountains.

Peichu Lurong had lived some time outside the region, he thought about the long trek residents in his hometown had to make to pick up mail.

That encouraged Lurong to return home to establish a Cainiao Post station.

Each day he makes a round trip of over 100 kilometers to retrieve packages for the 500 inhabitants of his village.

While China's population continues to age, we know that many senior citizens have found it more difficult to integrate fast evolving digital tools into their lives.

As a result, we continue to specially design services for our senior consumers.

We maintain and evolve a set of standards for age focused features under our Special Action for Aging and Barrier free Transformation of Internet Applications.

Taobao senior mode addresses key issues faced by older users, which we call the three struggles : the struggle to see clearly, the struggle to understand fully, and the struggle to use effectively.

We have enlarged display fonts and made our interface easier to read.

We designed our voice assistant to cover search, logistics, reminders, phone bills, interactions and other scenarios, simplifying the text input process for this older cohort.

Moreover, we have made it possible for family and friends to quickly share a one click link to enable senior mode.

Furthermore, we have added a special prompt to the payment interface to make the it easier to use and help senior users encountering difficulties in completing their purchases.

We even added a feature to allow a family member to pay for them.

It's difficult to travel along this winding, snow covered road, so the delivery center that I manage is the only encourage seniors to seek medical care, the construction regular link between the villagers and the outside world.

If I were not here, the villagers would be cut off.

I'm of nationwide WeCare taxi assistance stations, and doing something that really fulfills a pressing need of theirs, he said.

The presence of the station has significantly community awareness campaigns for helping seniors.

Because technology is all too often designed without taking them into account, the 85 million people living with disabilities in China frequently miss out on the benefits of digital life.

We work hard to understand the needs of this group and create digital products and services that are optimized for accessibility.

We established the Taobao Information Accessibility Lab back in 2011, and since then we have built a systematic product monitoring and improvement mechanism for ensuring a barrier free user experience.

We prioritize feedback on user interface (UI) obstacles, and regularly invite our target user base to share their actual experiences and needs.

A range of our products are continuously optimizing their accessible UI.

At present, Taobao's app fully supports use by visually impaired users, including text and picture to voice functions.

In FY2022, Taobao served 305,000 visually impaired users.

In December 2020, our Youku video hosting platform and the China Braille Library cooperated to launch the first online audio visual platform for barrier free services in the industry, and officially launched a Barrier free Theater.

On International Day for People with Disabilities, we released the barrier free edition of Youku app with film and television content, especially for short videos.

After the version was launched, visually impaired users could use screen reading software to read the information on our interface and select their favorite film and television works through voice commands.

Through collecting extensive feedback from visually impaired users on their pain points with technology, we optimized the video player interaction, providing a much improved accessible viewing experience.

FY2022, nearly 1.5 million viewers watched movies on Youku Barrier free Theater.

To give people with mobility disabilities easier access to travel and transit, Amap launched the accessibility routing and facility labeling function on its maps in 2017.

It works by displaying accessible elevators on subway station maps, and automatically plotting accessible routes for the user with one click.

Amap is also the first company in China to develop a visually impaired mode, making it easier for the visually impaired them to understand real time road information.

Ele.me and Tmall Genie collaborated to enable visually impaired people to order food directly with their voice using the Tmall Genie smart speaker assistant, which includes support for different dialects.

In addition, Tmall Genie also supports voiceprint verified payment to allow safe and reliable ease of payment for users with disabilities.

Enjoying trustworthy consumption is an essential part of a better digital life.

We strive to ensure our consumers can have confidence in three areas: product quality and safety, user privacy and data security protection, and responsive service.

In January 2017, we established the Alibaba Anti Counterfeiting Alliance (AACA) to work collectively to tackle the challenge of counterfeit goods by combining the inherent knowledge of brand owners, our intelligent technology, as well as law enforcement and civil legal channels.

As of March 2022, more than 1,100 brands from 21 countries have joined the AACA.

We take seriously our role as the gatekeeper for consumers on our platforms, and we strive to establish clear their rights, and raises public awareness of the importance of protecting the intellectual property of and enforced rules, while developing and using the latest technology to support this role.

When infringing stores are spotted in the offline world such as shopping a digital quality assurance mechanism and have taken measures to govern it.

Counterfeiting not only hurts rights holders, it also harms consumers and erodes their trust.

With support from market supervision bureaus, public safety authorities, and judicial agencies, our system uses digital technology to enable consumers to work in tandem with brands to protect their rights.

When consumers notice infringing stores in physical environments, they can access the Consumer Reporting System on Taobao and upload pictures of the infringements, the location of the seller, and other information.

We then use technology to cross reference before sending the information to the brand owners for enforcement action.

For example, Tmall carries out strict management of merchant platform entry, advertising and quality, inspection and sampling, and so on.

We carefully craft and maintain quality control processes that are appropriate for each of our diverse services.

Our quality assurance is underpinned by a full, closed loop management pathway that introduces advanced technologies such as AI identification and blockchain traceability technology to track and promote quality, transparency, and reliability.

We also actively collaborate with consumer groups, regulatory agencies, public interest organizations, and others, and share our product quality monitoring and management technology to combat counterfeit and shoddy goods.

To improve product reliability for consumers, we have established the Tmall Global Quality Partner Alliance, gathering 91 international and Chinese third party testing and inspection institutions.

By leveraging blockchain and big data technology, it tracks information of the supply chain and links of imported products, including details on production, packaging, transportation, customs declarations, third party testing, retail sales, and so on.

Global Traceability QR Code has been labeled on every piece of product that joined the Project, so that consumers have easy access to the information of the imported products, thus consuming with greater confidence.

Protecting the privacy of consumers is the basis for trustworthy consumption.

Privacy Code Protection service is not just about locking away data.

Merchants must understand their customers well enough to ensure that personalized and quality services can be provided.

We deeply ingrain the concept of privacy protection and data security into our practices, making full use of privacy technology to achieve data sharing in a trusted environment.

To this end, we have formulated three guiding principles that we strive to follow: minimal data collection, maximum user awareness and choices, and the strongest user data protection in our products and services.

Make users aware of the scope of data collection and its intended uses through clear prompts, pop ups, and forms.

Once data is collected, strictly protect users' basic rights in areas such as access, inquiry, withdrawal, modification, or deletion.

Develop a range of privacy services and improve privacy management functions, including a privacy policy inquiry portal, privacy over one's friends, and data consent management and withdrawal.

Ensure the user's right to know how their data is used: 1) establish an algorithm management system that is transparent to supervision, and can fulfill our legal obligations and 2) build an algorithm operations mechanism that is transparent and interpretable, ensuring the user's right to know.

Opt out option: Provide users with the option to easily opt out of personalized recommendations.

For example, Taobao has the option to turn off recommendations based on personal data.

Optimize our recommendations: Establish a feedback mechanism for users to ensure that they have the right to offer their opinions on the results of algorithmic decisions.

We keep improving our systems to ensure strong protection of user data in our products.

In early 2022, we adopted virtual phone number functions for consumer privacy protection in major apps such as Taobao, Amap, and Ele.me.

Merchants and service providers contact consumers without knowing their real numbers.

On the Taobao app alone, this new function has already covered more than 500 million active consumers.

We have developed features and mechanisms on our platforms to ensure that users can protect their personal privacy during the whole process of ordering, payments, and fulfillment.

We only transmit data absolutely necessary for fulfillment.

In 2022, Taobao introduced its Privacy Code Protection service, allowing users to use a virtual phone number throughout the whole purchase and fulfillment process.

Our Amap and Ele.me apps have also introduced free Privacy Code Protection services, allowing complete assurance throughout the process.

August 15, 2022, our virtual phone number feature has covered over 500 million active consumers on Taobao.

Turning this on will use virtual numbers with merchants and riders.

Recommendations Manage personalized recommendations functions.

Personalized recommendation Turning this off will disable personalized recommendations for the user.

Communication issues with customer service is a pain point for many customers.

Ultimately, the best customer service is when no customer service is needed, and as such we try hard accessible, timely, and empathetic customer service, resolving the concern of consumers when ordering.

In 2003, we established our Customer Experience Improvement Center, and have continually trained a team of purchasing decisions, but allows sellers to get feedback to improve their products and services.

This not only helps consumers make better dedicated staff with the goal of resolving customer problems.

We adhere to two tenets: first, we make it as easy as possible for users to contact us, and then we focus on resolving their issues as expeditiously as possible.

Our technology powered methods include a customer service hotline, live online chat rooms, and automated service bots available at the click of a button.

Users can easily access customer service portals in all of our apps to request the platform's intervention should any issues arise.

We were also among the first in China to launch services such as our 7 day no questions asked returns and speedy refunds for customers.

In FY2022, more than 900 million orders were refunded, covered by our speedy refund system.

In May 2021, we launched a new complaint handling protocol that empowers our staff to solve user issues proactively.

Meanwhile, we strive to prevent the occurrence of issues in the first place by constantly looking for ways to improve product quality, fulfillment, and services.

Tmall's complaint rate represented just 0.015% of total orders, with a complaint response rate of 100%.

Responsible consumption means helping consumers achieve better lives while limiting and reducing harmful social and environmental impacts.

This covers a wide range of environmentally and socially beneficial consumer practices that we are supporting.

We endeavor to advocate for greater environmental awareness, using our platform to influence and change consumer perceptions and behaviors in multiple arenas.

While we promote the adoption of low carbon lifestyles on the consumer side (refer to Chapter 1, Section 2, Sub section: Scope 3 actions), we also stimulate the supply of green goods and discourage environmentally harmful goods.

An increasing number of consumers are prioritizing responsible consumption, especially by choosing green products.

As such, we are working to promote these sustainably sourced goods on our platforms, such as energy saving home appliances, recycled and biodegradable materials, and organic foods.

Through a variety of offline and online channels, we are also helping to popularize green packaging and recycling of our products, in order to promote the green behavior of hundreds of millions of consumers.

We will further encourage consumers to practice green consumption behavior by designing green incentives, and continuously expanding the green consumer community.

The rapid increase in the use of packaging, especially plastics, has been an unfortunate by product of growing consumption.

At Alibaba, we have both an obligation and capacity to help forestall this trend.

By adopting green packaging, we stimulate a series of positive effects, of which carbon reduction is only one dimension, and which includes knock on effects like the reduction of plastic pollution.

We strive to make green and simple packaging options more visible.

Taobao's Green Mall section, we featured goods with green packaging (non tape zipper boxes, degradable packaging, and shipping in original boxes), including beauty, food, and other products.

Warehouse, Cainiao will mark their fulfillment details with a green package tag.

During the 6.18 Shopping Festival in 2022, Taobao, Tmall, and nearly 40 brands collectively advocated for simpler packaging that reduces use of plastic, printing ink, and other packaging materials.

Participating brands have integrated both simplicity and environmental awareness into using innovative designs to simplify and reduce packaging.

At Intime Department Stores, we have been replacing taped delivery boxes with the choice of re usable zipper bags.

We also encourage shipping box recycling to increase the lifespan of the packaging.

An important channel of participation is through Cainiao's box recycling program which operates convenient box drop off sites at a number of local Cainiao stations.

We worked with our million strong merchant partners to offer rewards for box recycling.

The program currently covers 315 cities in 31 provincial administrative regions.

In November 2021, Alibaba and Unilever jointly launched a campaign to encourage consumers to recycle and reuse plastic bottles at recycling machines by rewarding them with green energy points.

Plastic recycling machines have been installed at more than 170 Tmall offline stores across the country by July 2022.

Southeast Asia, collaborating with partner brands to make environment friendly products easy to access and recognize.

These include green fashion brands and goods that reduce plastic in manufacturing, packaging, and transportation processes.

Lazada aims to encourage more consumers to make responsible consumption choices, especially in the purchase of daily necessities.

We have begun experimenting with Easy Green labels, focusing on environmentally friendly products that are biodegradable, renewable, and packaged in optimized, reduced, or no plastic ways.

We hope to transform harmful searches into a public educational project that all sectors of society can participate in and make positive contributions to together.

We also take seriously the potential for facilitation of self harm.

In July 2019, several teams at Alibaba jointly introduce the Life is Precious project, focused on noticing early warning signs of psychological crisis among users.

When sellers are alerted to a risk, such as through a customer searching or asking about self harm implements, they act as the first line of defense by immediately responding with dissuasion and words of comfort while also contacting trained professionals in Alibaba Safety's suicide prevention team.

In the case of a severe emergency, Alibaba will also contact local first responders so that they can intervene and help.

Through March 31, 2022, over 4,400 people who have shown signs of distress have received such intervention on our platforms.

Beyond that, more than 34,000 people have called the hotline on the project page for psychological counseling.

Through our re commerce platform Idle Fish, we strive to create the world's largest market for second harms our planet and society.

In 2020, we worked with partners to launch the GreenNet Program for responsible consumption.

Every transaction guarantees a reduction in the consumption of new resources.

For example, a search for ivory will lead to articles on elephant conservation, while a search for styrofoam containers leads to information on environmental damage from these products.

Idle Fish has introduced innovative solutions for many issues faced by re commerce markets including can increase consumer awareness and not only phase these products out of our platforms, but from the rest item standardization, quality control, and dispute resolution.

The platform has transformed second hand of society.

With some products, we also provide recommendations for responsible alternatives.

We have also trading into a more viable option through a number of creative features.

These include linking to other integrated a reporting system into our platform to allow users to flag environmentally harmful products that are e commerce platforms such as Taobao and Tmall to offer seamless traceability and information for goods being sold under false pretenses.

We have also worked hard to combat the sale of harmful and violent products and to protect younger and to resolve disputes and bolster reliability through a form of co governance which enables users to vulnerable users from risks such as fraud, explicit materials, online bullying and abuse, and other risks to their participate in dispute resolution processes as peer jurors.

These innovations are critical to the successful health and well being.

As of June 30, 2022, the GreenNet program has so far displayed information on the risks of development of second hand markets.

As a technology driven platform company, we commit to empowering businesses across our ecosystem, in particular micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), to become more competitive and generate scalable and inclusive employment.

We believe that high quality digital transformation and development should lead to a world in which no one will be left behind.

Responsible technology should be green, and we strive to be the green leader in cloud technology in innovation.

In FY2022, we spent over RMB120 billion on technology related expenditures.

To achieve this, we will continue to improve the energy efficiency of our hardware, increase the serve the social good, the technologies themselves must be responsible, which means having high standards of use of clean energy, expand the recycling of waste heat and hardware, and continue to innovate.

For being efficient, environmentally friendly, cutting edge, inclusive, and open.

Here we focus on Alibaba Cloud to more information, please refer to Section 1 of Chapter 1, Greening our operations and value chain.

We have been long recognized as the leading Chinese company in open source activity and impact.

The 21st century is the century of digitalization.

Fully harvesting the digital dividends for everyone relies critically on driving computing performance higher while using fewer resources such as energy.

As companies move to the cloud, they see major performance and efficiency gains, and reduced reliance on resources, with benefits to themselves and to the environment.

Alibaba Cloud is a recognized global leader in cloud services.

In the 2021 Gartner Solution Scorecard for integrated IaaS and PaaS, Alibaba Cloud received the highest scores in the four core evaluations of computing, storage, network, and security (required), separately.

Aside from improving our own operations, we have also leveraged the cloud to create intelligent tools to help our business ecosystem achieve a green transition.

This includes our Energy Expert, which helps organizations monitor and reduce their energy use.

Maintaining our leadership in core technologies is essential to achieving all our goals.

What makes this possible is our people working on the cutting edge of many foundational technologies.

Alibaba currently holds more than 13,000 global patents, with 10,000 in key fields that include cloud computing, artificial intelligence, data technology, and other areas of intense research.

At Alibaba, we strive to make it easy for anyone to start a new business using our cloud and other platforms.

More than ten million MSMEs in our platform ecosystem, such as our merchants, use cloud computing to operate their businesses.

Besides that, more than four million customers use Alibaba Cloud services globally.

In China, one measure of our success is that among the nationally recognized little giants, small, leading innovative firms across varied sectors 65% were using Alibaba Cloud, and 50% of them were using our smart office platform DingTalk, as of the end of FY2022.

In 2021, we initiated the Welcome to the Cloud program for MSMEs, and have helped them in finding office spaces, deploying and using technology, and hiring talent.

This is the largest economic inequality challenge in China and experienced with modern commerce, and empower them with Alibaba's resources to design in many parts of the world.

First, by continuing to spur economic development by building China's largest e commerce market into rural areas to better connect rural and urban economies and markets.

Second, by doing our part to help upgrade rural value chains, and bring much needed logistics facilities, production technologies, as well as marketing and branding capabilities.

By sharing our digital platform and branding programs, we are helping rural communities and their entrepreneurs to meet the growing demand for green and organic products, ecotourism, and authentic cultural goods and services.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, in 2021, the annual per capita disposable income of urban households in China was RMB47,412.

Through our e commerce platforms, many in rural areas have become active participants in the digital marketplace and in doing so helped to promote development.

Taobao Villages continue to show the potential value realized when digital technology helps to lower geographic barriers.

The number of Taobao Villages grew from 3 in 2009 to 7,023 in 2021, across 28 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities.

Villages, together with 2,171 Taobao Towns, exceeded RMB1.3 trillion on our platform.

In the same year, we helped local residents sell RMB128.1 billion worth of products from 832 counties previously categorized as impoverished under China's national standards.

RMB1,300 billion in sales in 2021 by 7,023 Taobao Villages and 2,171 Taobao Towns on our platforms.

RMB128.1 billion in sales in 2021 by 832 counties previously categorized as impoverished on our platforms.

In 2014 we launched our Rural Taobao strategy as Alibaba's first comprehensive program to bring digital connections and e commerce to rural towns and villages.

In 2017, we launched the Alibaba Poverty Alleviation Fund, with a focus on five major issues: education, healthcare, women, the environment, and e commerce solutions.

Since 2019, we have run our unique rural commissioners program, where senior Alibaba managers are sent to live in rural regions to assess local needs and then develop tailor made digital solutions for sustainable socioeconomic development.

In 2021, we upgraded our rural initiatives with the Alibaba Rural Revitalization Fund and also announced our Hometown Initiative.

Alibaba has never thought of its business as planting a seed that will instantly blossom with flowers.

For many endeavors, you have to persist for 8 10 years until roots are firmly planted and flowers can bloom.

A village can qualify as a Taobao Village if it achieves annual sales of RMB10 million, and either has more than 100 active e commerce stores or where at least 10% of local households operate e commerce stores.

A town can qualify as a Taobao Town if it has at least three Taobao Villages, and either total sales from the town exceeds RMB30 million or the number of active e commerce stores exceeds 300.

Yunxi county in the Qinba Mountains used to be one of Hubei province's nine counties in extreme poverty, with a poverty rate that registered at 32.7%.4 In the village of Xiaying, local official Tingzhou Liu found a path out through e commerce, promoting the sale of unique local turquoise stones.

Tingzhou also supported local families in setting up stores.

Taobao Village, and by 2017 it became one of the first villages entirely lifted out of poverty in Hubei.

E commerce's biggest impact was introducing to us a new idea.

The so called new economy is actually an Internet powered digital economy.

A vibrant and sustainable local economy is the key to rural revitalization.

We help to develop the value chains necessary to empower rural industries.

Our areas of focus include building capabilities for rural e commerce, developing rural brands, promoting smart agriculture, and boosting rural tourism.

We build direct procurement rural bases in many areas, in which we apply digitalization to improve research and development, boost production efficiency, and increase product standardization, helping create value across the entire agricultural value chain.

Currently, Freshippo has more than 550 agricultural direct procurement centers in China.

We apply our digital technology and market capabilities to promote order driven production and introduce better standardization and quality control.

Since 2019, we have run our Freshippo Village model, in which we work with villages using our steady orders to build a stable producer relationship, which helps to promote the standardization, specialization, and digital transformation of production.

Freshippo shares its analytics and market insights with producers, helping them to adjust their production efficiently.

As of October 2021, there were 136 Freshippo villages nationwide, spread across 19 provinces and regions.

In December 2020, Daizhuang Village became the first Freshippo Village in Jiangsu Province.

Freshippo meticulously established standards for each type of agricultural product from the village, earning Daizhuang a reputation as a high quality brand among consumers.

What began with rice has now steadily expanded to 40 other products, including vegetables and persimmons.

Previously, our high quality agricultural products couldn't be sold at a great price.

Now working with Freshippo, this bottleneck has been addressed.

Solving this 'last mile' sales problem has been a major achievement for Daizhuang's modernization of our agricultural business.

Cainiao continues to invest to ensure a widely available village service network with local partners.

Approximately 50,000 Cainiao rural village stations are helping to improve capacity in more villages to deliver rural products efficiently across China.

More than 1,000 Cainiao county level logistics warehouses have also been built.

This includes more than 400 counties formerly on China's national poverty list.

In some locations, we have been deploying technology to enable higher value added processing, for example, in automating functions such as sorting, storage, delivery, and quality control.

Over 1,000 Cainiao county level smart logistics centers have been built across the country, covering more than 400 counties previously on the national poverty list.

Majia pomelos are a specialty variety of citrus from Shangrao City in Jiangxi Province and a major local product.

The pomelo industry has historically relied on manual labor for sorting, storage, and transportation, resulting in low efficiency and lackluster competitiveness.

In 2021, Shangrao partnered with Cainiao to upgrade the production process and logistics of their Majia pomelo.

A Cainiao smart logistics center was set up, using an intelligent sorting system to automate quality control and determine fruit pricing.

With increased productivity and product consistency, Shangrao's Majia farmers saw revenues increase by 20%.

We deploy our platform resources to provide digitally powered and integrated management of rural value chains.

We try to find areas where we can support local businesses in operations or in market access.

This trend can benefit substantially from improved branding and market access, in sourcing, production, logistics, sales, and other links along the value chain.

It also boosts sales and pricing for suppliers, raising rural incomes and boosting rural development.

Alibaba is trying to help enable and accelerate this growth.

In 2021, we launched the Seeking Beauty in Rural Areas initiative, which gathered over 1,000 professional designers and design profession students across the country to become design officers for social impact.

Together they crafted branding for underdeveloped counties to accentuate their cultural heritage and appeal, and help boost market recognition for their local products.

To date, the initiative has helped 10 underdeveloped counties create professionally tailored sets of brand designs.

Longquan Municipality in Zhejiang collaborated with Alibaba to create sets of digital value chains to support four principal local agricultural industries: bamboo, tea, mushrooms, and vegetables.

The digital platforms provide local farmers and small businesses with intelligent production advisory, industry and market analysis, marketing and sales functions.

This all in one digital support has helped local businesses increase their online sales by RMB30 million, benefiting 200 farming families.

In recognition of the innovative use of technology in rural development, Longquan Municipality was chosen as a trial scheme within the common prosperity policy Initiative by the Bureau of Commerce of Zhejiang Province.

At the same time, we helped build a digital marketing campaign for Yijun products on the platform.

Through these efforts, the profit margins of Yijun's apples grew by 10% 20%.

In June 2021, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Institute of Crop Sciences (ICS) and Alibaba jointly launched the 3T Smart Breeding platform.

Foundation, the project integrates biotechnology, information technology, and AI for a more powerful seed development process.

In the past year, we completed version 1.0 of the platform, which digitized the entire process of plant breeding to allow field trial design, field data analysis integration, and phenotypic and genomic analysis to all be accessed in a single AI powered system.

We see enormous digitalization dividends for the future of farming and have been actively working to develop digital agriculture solutions.

This includes the implementation of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) technology combined with data analysis.

We have designed and deployed digital technology that can help attain higher levels of standardization, productivity, and quality control, to improve their overall yields.

November 2021, we had launched digital farms in 12 provinces, autonomous regions, or municipalities.

One could say we didn't design Yijun, but rather found it.

So our work has a rustic and carefree feel, seemingly as if it hasn't been deliberately designed.

Alibaba Cloud and the Zhengzhou Fruit Research Institute (ZFRI) developed a digital planting model for a digitally powered farm growing Dangshan pears.

The farm is able to achieve more precise nutrition management to increase yields and resilience.

China's countryside is replete with attractive natural landscapes and cultural heritage.

One way Alibaba is positioned to support a successful rural economy is by helping to improve digital and offline businesses, there is much we can do to link agriculture, education, health and wellness, and leisure literacy, especially that of working age residents, to bolster their employment opportunities.

Alibaba is making talent development and capacity building the central focus of our strategy for rural linking them to urban demand.

In FY2023, we aim to help build up 10 model rural tourism counties, to help further development, which manifests itself in a number of programs: promote this development and to enable more people to enjoy what the countryside has to offer.

We station Alibaba employees in rural areas with schemes such as our rural commissioner and rural technology officers programs.

These are uniquely valuable programs, by bringing digitally savvy senior managers to places that have lacked such experience before.

We establish digital employment and training schemes to create opportunities, building up the local digital economy.

Tour and Pinggu's Must Travel List for those who were inspired to visit.

Since 2019, Alibaba has sent a total of 27 rural commissioners with long term postings to underdeveloped counties in China.

These commissioners live alongside the locals and get to know the area intimately, both its challenges and opportunities.

This allows them to design specialized development plans in line with local conditions and interests.

Leveraging resources across Alibaba, they can establish the concepts, tools, and capabilities to develop these communities.

In 2021, we also sent out rural technology officers in a similar vein to tackle opportunities in digitalization.

When he arrived in Xunwu, he brought his experience with digital technology and market knowledge.

Xinxian identified marketing as a bottleneck for locals in selling their goods, so one of his main projects was to establish a livestreaming academy, where popular Taobao livestreamers teach classes.

Alibaba software architect Kang Han grew up in the countryside and has always wanted to find ways to help promote rural China.

Kang volunteered for the rural technology officer program and was sent to Qingjian in Shanxi province.

After surveying the area, he realized that its native high grade, free range black pigs had untapped market potential.

Kang created a five million steps branding concept that used a digital sensor system to record each pig's lifetime steps.

When the pork reaches Freshippo's store shelves, consumers can scan a unique code to access a host of information.

This gave them confidence in the conditions the animals were raised in and created a connection with the farmers of Qingjian.

For rural regions to prosper in the long term, they need healthy and self sustaining economies.

That means giving employment and training opportunities to young people to help them move up the economic ladder.

Success gives them a real choice to remain in their rural hometowns while enjoying a good job and a better life.

Interactive livestreaming on Taobao has become an increasingly important sales channel for e commerce.

It also provides a platform for rural entrepreneurs to develop into online influencers, who can not only help themselves but often introduce their hometowns to the broader world in the process.

Hometown Initiative and our Rural Livestreaming Program, we have so far trained 110,000 people in rural areas to be livestreamers, and conducted 2.3 million livestreaming sessions.

Chestnuts are a popular local product in the vast growing area of Qinglong, Hebei.

However, local farmers had long been reliant on re sellers for market access.

With training from the Alibaba Foundation, the village has become a success story not just for e commerce, but also for women's empowerment.

Due to traditional gender attitudes in Qinglong, most women stay at home.

The first move of our rural commissioner Lin Liu was to create a business plan for using e commerce to sell the local chestnuts.

Through her efforts, the popularity of these chestnuts created a sensation throughout the province.

She welcomed local women into a new livestreaming office, empowering many of them to introduce themselves to the world, building their own brands in the process.

Digitalization is not a vast gulf to be crossed, but it is instead the key to women for being more independent, confident, and self reliant.

Plan, which helps rural talent find job opportunities at home.

As of March 31, 2022, it has covered 45 counties in 15 provinces, helping 9,414 people, over half with post secondary degrees, to gain employment in their local areas by FY2022.

Investment in local education resources is a cornerstone of Alibaba's efforts.

Over the past few years, we have initiated a series of projects including our Rural Education Plan and Vocational Training Plan, which have given 610,000 rural teachers and students additional training.

In 2020, we pioneered the Customer Service County model in Xunwu, Jiangxi Province.

This initiative aims to promote digital employment opportunities for young people in rural areas through training and job creation in the digital service industry.

As a result of this initiative, Xunwu has gained 200 direct jobs, with indirect benefits to the entire area.

These are jobs that offer higher pay, secure benefits, and a professional life previously unavailable to the county.

We have rolled out this program in over 45 counties.

When I first joined the project, my idea was simply to get a job.

Then I realized that the longer I stayed here, the more I was able to achieve and grow at every step, starting from when I was on the front line.

After I began managing the team, I was surprised by my own growth.

In 2021, we announced the launch of the Student Cloud Assistance program, which seeks to stimulate children's creativity and skills at an early age, and importantly, to improve their digital literacy.

The program builds a number of cloud based computer rooms in rural schools to provide teaching support and foster a culture of digital knowledge and learning.

Vocational education is an important path to bridging the necessary skills to promote employment and entrepreneurship.

When well targeted, it can be of great help in narrowing gaps in opportunities and incomes for regions and for individual beneficiaries.

Since 2014, Alibaba has drawn on our strengths to actively invest in fostering local e commerce talents and regional e commerce businesses.

By April 2022, we had worked alongside regional governments, enterprises, and local industrial parks to jointly build 71 regional digital talent training centers, with more than 800 online and offline sessions.

The system provides more professional and effective management of the health records of local residents, improving their experience.

It also improves the governance and operations of Tiantai's healthcare system.

Rural areas must also close the gap in healthcare services.

To address this, we are investing in rural medical capabilities and also supporting the training of rural doctors and other medical professionals.

China Red Cross Foundation to launch a physician training platform.

The project provides doctors in relatively under developed areas with skills training and information resources, aiming to improve the capabilities of local doctors in the diagnosis and treatment of common diseases, early screening for severe diseases, and improved standards of care for acute and severe conditions.

By March 2022, the project had reached 421 county level hospitals and conducted trainings for county level hospital doctors that have registered more than 70,000 total attendances through interactive online exchanges and teaching programs covering a wide range of specialized topics.

Strengthening social resilience is now key to sustainable development.

Building resilience into cloud services in three important ways.

First, we ensure the resilience of our core systems in times of crisis, so that we can support the normal operation of the digital business ecosystem, which relies on our services, and to better support society after shocks.

We take potential natural disaster risks into careful consideration when designing and constructing our data centers.

We are actively innovating to increase the disaster tolerance and fault tolerance capabilities of infrastructure through the design of hardware facilities and the improvement of our overall planning.

We adopt the key fortification category (Class B) in data center design, and raised the structural seismic level to the first class seismic standard.

Both natural disasters and global health crises can threaten the integrity of logistics operations, causing supply chain issues that threaten economic production and people's lives.

To protect the functioning of our logistics services during natural disasters, Cainiao has made extensive preparations, from the design of our emergency response mechanisms and resource allocation plans, to thorough employee training.

In line with national policies, we develop emergency response mechanisms for various intensities and types of disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, and heavy rains.

Through rigorous training of our employees, we ensure that in the event of a natural disaster, our team is able to rapidly respond to emergency situations.

Cainiao has successfully built an extensive global logistics network with our international partners that connects hubs around the world through our smart digital technology.

This network not only enhances our resilience as a company, but also enhances community resilience in response to disasters.

Cloud services and supply chain logistics are essential foundations of the digital business ecosystem.

We are actively carrying out comprehensive assessments of natural and technical risks, taking seriously our responsibility to ensure stability and continuity in the core functioning of these facilities.

Since the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic in 2020, supply chains have faced numerous challenges.

Our first task has been to protect our employees and their families, and then work to help the global community mitigate the impact of the public health crisis on livelihoods and the economy.

The continuity of logistics services has been of utmost importance to Alibaba since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020.

In cooperation with public agencies, we have strived to ensure that consumers are able to obtain daily necessities.

During the pandemic, we set up a special fund to supply medical supplies.

Alibaba Foundation and Cainiao jointly established an information and logistics operation platform for medical supply procurement and donations, both in China and abroad.

Through this initiative, we were able to successfully deliver batches of ventilators and PPE to people in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere.

Residents can also use the code for evacuation, and assist in to enter disaster shelters and directing nearby rescue workers apply for relief assistance.

This platform has helped the Ministry to address emergencies ranging from floods and earthquakes to gas explosion accidents in a number of provinces.

As a builder of sustainable community, we strive to unleash the power of technology to bring people together to tackle our common challenges.

We seek to foster a participatory philanthropy that starts with our own employees and expands outward to involve those across our entire ecosystem to make it easy to do good anywhere within and beyond the confines of our business.

We want all Aliren, guided by their empathy and social responsibility, to channel their talents and creative thinking to tackle societal problems.

As such, we have devoted significant efforts to build a system that inspires them to become involved and allows them to participate in many ways in social causes beyond the business.

At Alibaba, we try to build a culture where everyone regularly participates in philanthropic activities.

FY2022, we donated RMB550 million to the Alibaba Foundation for charitable causes.

Back in 2015, we launched our Three Hours for a Better World initiative to ask all Aliren to dedicate at least three hours per year to social causes outside work.

Aliren also band together in groups to work on a cause under the Hugs and Help umbrella.

Founded in 2010, Hugs and Help groups now cover a number of fields including environmental protection, animal protection, support for senior citizens and vulnerable groups, and children's education, among others.

Many children in the remote Daliang Mountains of Sichuan are so called left behind children, whose parents migrated to cities for economic reasons.

The kids often face economic hardships and lack enough adult role models.

Chunying Liu, a tech professional at Alibaba who was touched by their needs, started the Letter to Kids in Daliang Mountain project two years ago.

Chunying's initiative has encouraged over 400 Alibaba employees to join and collectively give loving support to some 260 children.

These volunteers help arrange regular deliveries of daily necessities, provide tuition assistance, and keep in touch with the children through a personal penpal system.

The winter here is freezing, but I feel warm reading your letter.

I hope that when I grow up I can be like you and also help others.

Alibaba established a unique system through which every three years our employees elect a philanthropy committee of ten people from their own ranks.

People with hearing impairments encounter daily communication challenges.

A team at DAMO Academy worked together to create the Digital Sign Language Interpreter.

DAMO used 3D technology to create a virtual sign language interpreter, Xiao Mo, who translates spoken sentences into sign language on screen.

Because sign language is comprised of subtle gestures and regional differences, it remains a technical challenge that requires continuous effort to develop and improve.

The Alibaba Charity List was set up to recognize and reward outstanding internal teams, individuals, and projects that have made significant contributions to the public good.

More than 300 internal and external judges selected 10 of the most touching and valuable public service projects and recognized 14 individuals.

Alibaba helps incubate some of the best projects by setting up a RMB100 million fund.

Through these mutually supporting programs within Alibaba, we are dedicated to ensuring our charity programs can grow and help these projects attract internal attention so that like minded people can join and be inspired.

Technology philanthropy has become an important part of Alibaba's ESG strategy and is one of the main means for us to devote ourselves to public well being.

We are promoting technologies that benefit everyone, are responsible, and are open and shared.

We believe there is a lot of potential for technology firms to fulfill their social responsibilities.

Many of the world's problems remain unaddressed not only because of a lack of resources, but because of a lack of information flow, coordination, and public awareness.

We are well positioned to help various public service groups to address these issues to maximize their effectiveness.

In October 2017, Alibaba devoted funding, staff, and technological resources to developing a platform for online drug use prevention education to reach students in schools.

Bridge Second Classroom went online in June 2018, and by June 2022 it covered 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous areas, reaching 230,000 elementary and middle schools.

About 106 million students have participated in over 900 million hours of online classes learning about the dangers of drug use.

Green Bridge Second Classroom was awarded as a National Exemplary Organization in Anti Drug Efforts. areas such as data gathering, data processing, and visualization, we help improve information flow and resource coordination in this critical effort.

For certain social issues, spreading information quickly is crucial.

This is exemplified by the distressing cases of missing children.

To address this problem, Alibaba helped build the Reunion System.

When a new case of a missing child is reported by authorities, the Reunion System broadcasts the child's information across 25 popular apps to users who are near the child's last known whereabouts, with the alert radius expanding 100km with each passing hour.

As of May 15, 2022, the Reunion System had sent out alerts for 5,038 missing children's cases and assisted in the recovery of 4,960 of them.

In the last program year alone, we assisted in the recovery of 253 missing children.1 Nearly 200 Aliren from across 16 business units voluntarily devoted their skills and time to developing and maintaining the system.

We also run a parallel effort for children who have been missing for longer periods.

Alibaba recognizes the critical role of non profits and social entrepreneurs in driving wider and positive societal change.

Therefore, we are committed to augmenting their capabilities by sharing free, accessible, and affordable technological solutions and services.

In 2017, Alibaba Cloud engineers created a technical volunteer service platform, Green Code, to help non profits with technical needs connect with skilled tech volunteers.

As of the release date of this report, more than 330 non profit organizations and more than 6,000 volunteer programmers have registered.

Over 300 tech volunteers used simplified and easy to manage software code to develop management applications for over 20 charity projects, supporting the digital transformation of these organizations.

However, it was still relying on traditional time consuming office processes such as manually filled Excel spreadsheets.

Digitization enabled by our Green Code platform streamlined their processes, increasing operational efficiency, and freeing up time for their most important work.

We are helping non profit organizations improve transparency in their operations so as to build public trust and boost fundraising.

To do so, we shared our blockchain technology to establish a public service standard for tracking donations.

As of March 2021, every public charitable donation via Alibaba platforms had been registered on the system.

This facilitates trust building by ensuring the transparency of each donation allocation.

Since March 2021, our XIN 100 program has sought to provide all around support to nurture and assist philanthropic projects whose work aligns with Alibaba's ESG and philanthropic priorities.

At this stage, we have set five major areas for XIN 100 to target: rural revitalization, care for seniors and people with disabilities, helping children, environmental protection, and safety and emergency response.

XIN 100 aims to identify at least 100 major projects every year and bring together a wide range of resources to facilitate their implementation.

In FY2022, the XIN 100 project supported a total of 85 projects from 49 charitable organizations.

Alibaba's spirit of philanthropy reflects the saying many hands make light work.

In FY2022 alone, the program saw more than 500 million consumers and 2.2 million merchants participating.

The Companion Mother project was started by the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation in order to provide more adult influences for left behind children whose parents migrated to cities for jobs.

The project operates on the principle of one mother one family one bond, whereby professional full time mothers in each village coordinate the creation of a supportive family unit using funds from the project and other sources.

For every item purchased through the channel that is marked with a Companion Mother label, a small portion of the proceeds goes towards the Companion Mother project.

Over RMB10 million was raised for the project in two years, supporting the creation of sponsor families in over 200 villages, and improving the lives of nearly 170,000 children.

Fundraising is a perennial challenge for many charities, while the public often perceives a lack of convenient and credible channels to make donations.

Alibaba's Goods for Good is one program that targets both problems by giving merchants the ability to designate and label selected products where a portion of proceeds goes to a verified charitable cause.

In line with our participatory approach, this check out donation program aims to integrate social consciousness into regular shopping and touch a wide swath of people in a transparent way.

We carried out further analysis to refine the long list of issues and generate a short list of 22 issues.

Our analysis comprised consolidation among the long listed issues and further assessment on the topics’ direct relevance for our businesses, as well as the relevant trends and events related to specific issues.

To understand the views of key stakeholders in the short listed issues, we conducted a series of internal and external engagement and communications activities, including interviews and surveys.

We also use existing stakeholder communication channels to provide additional support information.

We analyze stakeholder feedback to understand the importance of each topic to them similarly, we also analyze the importance of each issue to Alibaba's business and sustainable development strategy.

We use the results of the importance assessment to generate a materiality matrix.

Based on the degree of importance of each issue to stakeholders and to ourselves, we classified the issues into four categories: prioritize continue internal efforts sustain and communicate monitor, comply, and manage.

The results of the materiality assessment reflect the most important ESG issues faced by our value chain and platform ecosystem stakeholders.

While placing issues in a matrix provides insight into our priorities, the relative importance of individual issues often varies by business unit, geographic region, and stakeholder group.

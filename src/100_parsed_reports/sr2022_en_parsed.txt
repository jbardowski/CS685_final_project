President and Group CEO

Addressing Environmental and Social Issues

We believe that empowering members of society to effectively confront environmental and social issues is an 
integral part of our mission as a financial institution.

Pursuing All-Out Efforts in Climate Change Measures

The ongoing trend toward decarbonization is expected to result in major changes in global industrial structure 
which, in turn, will position MUFG and its customers to address risks affecting their business continuity as well as 
seize opportunities for growth. Aiming to realize smooth transition to a decarbonized society and creating a 
sustainable society by fostering a virtuous cycle between the environment and economy, we have been promoting 
our climate change-related initiatives at a robust pace since announcing the MUFG Carbon Neutrality Declaration 
in May 2021. In April 2022, we published the MUFG Progress Report and announced interim targets to achieve 
net zero greenhouse gas （GHG） emissions from our financed portfolio in the power and oil & gas sectors. In 
June, all MUFG companies in Japan shifted contracted electricity to 100% renewable energy.

To realize carbon neutrality, it is important not only to achieve net zero GHG emissions in our own operations but 
also support the decarbonization efforts of our customers. Thus far, MUFG has furthered customer engagement 
with about 550 companies in Japan and overseas to identify the challenges and needs of each customer. Through 
these engagement efforts, we have simultaneously been reinforcing a diverse range of services to respond to 
identified needs, such as helping calculate their GHG emissions and TCFD-disclosure consulting services. In 
September, we drafted the MUFG Transition White Paper to bundle extensive information about decarbonization 
initiatives at Japanese companies, the environment surrounding energy policy in Japan, and other such topics, in 
addition to engaging in an exchange of ideas with policymakers overseas. By genuinely supporting customers 
tackle their challenges, I hope MUFG can drive decarbonization efforts together.

As a leading global company, MUFG engages and plays our part in international initiatives that meet pressing 
issues head-on. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance （NZBA） is one such initiative in which we are committed to 
communicating our views as an Asian representative in the Steering Group. We are also a member of its six 
working groups and chair of one, where we are directly involved in developing an international framework for 
transition financing.

MUFG will continue to contribute to decarbonization initiatives globally through engaging with clients, supporting 
technological advances that promote decarbonization, establishing rules, commercialization, market creation, and 
many other such measures.

Sustainability Promotion Structure

MUFG Under the supervision of the Board of Directors, MUFG has established a system to promote
sustainability centered on the Sustainability Committee.

This committee is chaired by the Group Chief Sustainability Off icer (CSuO), who is a member of the Board of
Directors and is responsible for all sustainability initiatives. The CSuO also serves as the Group Chief Strategy

Officer (CSO) in charge of corporate planning and strategy.

In principle, MUFG convenes the Sustainability Committee at least once a year to check and discuss the status
of sustainability initiatives and to report the contents to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors,

which supervise the Committee. In addition, two external advisors have been invited to provide expert opinions
on sustainability issues and risks at any time. These advisors exchange opinions with the members of the Board

of Directors and provide advice and recommendations from their professional standpoints on MUFG's
sustainability initiatives.

To increase general public's awareness of the MUFG Wealth Management

brand and promote sales activities, a large-scale Web seminar for our

a leading authority on the SDGs in Japan, who joined the session remotely
from Washington, D.C. and exchanged opinions on a wide range of topics,
including MUFG's sustainability management in relation to the SDGs and
individual companies' sustainability management examples, related
business opportunities, and ESG investment."

We held town hall meetings for employees. In fiscal 2021, these meetings were also
held at overseas bases.

In fiscal 2021, we held more than 1,000 town hall meetings between executive officers and employees. In April
2022, Group CEO Kamezawa flew to the United States for the first time in three years to host a town hall

meeting. While approximately 200 Group employees operating in the Americas physically attended the meeting,
around 180 individuals took part in the event online.

Addressing the attendees, Mr. Kamezawa shared his joy of visiting his colleagues in the United States, where he

previously resided as an expatriate and worked as part of a local team. He also expressed his gratitude to all

those who worked so hard on the sale of MUFG Union Bank as well as all those who contributed to the local

communities. Furthermore, the Group CEO stressed that MUFG’s commitment to its Americas business will

remain unchanged even after the above sale, and that the Group will continuously push ahead with

transformation into a speedy and flexible organization. Comments voiced by attendees included “The meeting

was held in a relaxed atmosphere, and I felt that I was a member of the same team” and “Mr. Kamezawa’s

emphasis on the Americas as a key growth region outside of Japan was very encouraging.”

We enhanced the content of information disclosure associated with our initiatives to
realize carbon neutrality and held special briefings for investors.

Since fiscal 2021, MUFG has stepped up its commitment to addressing
environmental and social issues. In May 2021, we announced the MUFG
Carbon Neutrality Declaration and, in the following month, hosted
seminars with themes that focused on the specific milestones set for

15

initiatives being undertaken to realize this declaration and promote

sustainable businesses.

We have since pushed ahead with these initiatives, taking a groupwide

approach and rallying Group members across the globe. In April 2022, we

issued the MUFG Progress Report, which summarizes our progress over

the course of the past year. At the same time, we held an investor

seminar, with Group CSuO Miyashita and General Manager Nishiyama

(Sustainable Business Division) addressing questions from attendees.

Comments from investors who joined the event included “I found the

content of the Progress Report to be wellorganizedin terms of explaining

how MUFG set its interim targets and showcasing examples of

engagement. Moreover, attending the seminar helped me better

understand these matters.” and “I have high expectations for Mr.

Nishiyama, who joined MUFG as a mid-career hire, as he will contribute

his robust expertise to help MUFG realize synergies arising from the

combination of new insights and its traditional strengths.”

Process of Identifying and Resolving Priority Issues

Process for Identifying 10 Priority Issues

We have de fined 10 priority issues that must be tackled to help achieve environmental and social sustainability in
light of our newly established Purpose, "Committed to empowering a brighter future." with an eye to better fulf -

illing society's expectations in areas where MUFG's capabilities can be brought to bear. 

STEP1．Assessing a broad range of environmental and social issues (218 issues)

Identified 218 issues by assessing environmental and social issues at home and abroad with reference to
theUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), stakeholder feedback regarding ESG issues and
therequirements set out in the various guidelines listed below

GRI Standards, United Nations Global Compact, SASB Standards, ISO26000, UN Department of Economic
and Social Affairs (After COVID-19), Issues selected by the Cabinet Office, etc.

STEP2．Screening, integrating and narrowing-down (123 issues)

Integrated the 218 issues into the 123 issues based on duplications or similarities, with the Sustainability Office
undertaking the primary screening

STEP3．Extracting (12 issues)

Climate Change Measures & Environmental Protection

MUFG recognizes that addressing climate change and environmental conservation is one of the most important
management issues. We will respond to them by regarding them as business opportunities and risk

management.
During this period, the movement to combat climate change gained tremendous global momentum. MUFG has

taken another step forward by announcing the MUFG Carbon Neutrality Declaration in May 2021. Guided by this
declaration, MUFG is implementing group-wide environmental measures globally, aiming to achieve net zero

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the financed portfolio by 2050 and net zero GHG emissions from our own
operations by 2030.

MUFG provides solutions to assist our customers innovate and to make structural changes to their business

model in order to solve environmental and social issues.

In July 2021, we established the Sustainable Business Division to further promote businesses that will help solve

environmental and social issues as a Group. We established a global structure to gather intelligence and capture

business opportunities through assigning ESG heads in each region – EMEA, Americas and APAC – who are

responsible for promoting the provision of sustainable financing solution and customer engagement, and having

active discussions through global forums such as the Global ESG Conference. In addition, by collecting

information from various perspectives through international initiatives, we are promoting rulemaking,

commercialization, and market creation globally to capture future business opportunities.

The Energy Transformation Strategy Project Team

In December 2021, the Japanese Corporate & Investment Banking Business Group launched the Energy

Transformation Strategy Project Team (EX Strategy PT).

In order to support the customers' energy transformation, the team is exploring how the  financial sector as a

whole can contribute to customers, while engaging in dialogs with customers, industry associations, and

government agencies. As an initiative, MUFG holds monthly meetings with about 300 employees from sales

divisions under the theme of energy transformation and promotes each effort while improving our response to

issues throughout the MUFG Group.

through project finance for

renewable energy projects by

a cumulative total of 70 million

tons from FY 2019 to FY

2030. This is equivalent to the

annual CO  emissions of

Governance

By November 2021, the Bank, the Trust Bank, and the Securities completed switching to 100% renewable energy
for their own domestic electricity contracts. Since the release of the MUFG Carbon Neutrality Declaration in May

2021, we have reduced domestic emissions by approximately 60% (approximately 30% of global emissions). In
addition, we have also completed switching to renewable electricity at some sites in Europe and Asia. In June

2022, NICOS and ACOM also completed switching to 100% renewable electricity. As a result, we were able
achieve 100% renewable electricity among all MUFG consolidated subsidiaries in Japan for their own-contracted

electricity, ahead of our initial schedule.

MUFG Environmental Policy Statement, MUFG Environmental and Social Policy
Framework

In MUFG Environmental Policy Statement and the MUFG Environmental and Social Policy Framework, MUFG
has established the following policies:

MUFG Environmental Policy Statement

(extract) [Maintenance and protection of the biodiversity which supports our society is the foundation for the
27
realization of a sustainable society. MUFG supports businesses that protect biodiversity through the provision of
products and services. Each group company also takes appropriate measures to prevent negative impacts on

biodiversity associated with our products and services.]

MUFG Environmental and Social Policy Framework

In light of the nature and severity of environmental and social risks or impacts, businesses that have a negative

impact on Ramsar-designated wetlands, businesses that have a negative impact on UNESCO World Heritage

sites, and businesses that violate the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild fauna

and Flora (Washington Convention) are defined as "Prohibited Transactions", In addition, as "Transactions of

High Caution", we have identified businesses that have a negative impact on areas with high conservation value

and sectors such as mining (coal), oil and gas, large-scale hydroelectric power generation, forestry, and palm oil.

When considering financing, we check the implementation status of environmental and social considerations by

our customers, including their impact on the ecosystem and how they are responding.

Endorsement of Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum

The TNFD is an international initiative launched in June 2021 by the

United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), the

United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Wide Fund

for Nature (WWF) and Global Canopy. TNFD aims to shift global financial

flows toward nature-positive outcomes through disclosure of nature-

related information by companies. The TNFD Forum is a stakeholder

organization to provides information and technical support related to

TNFD.

In February 2022, MUFG joined the TNFD Forum to promote initiatives for

natural capital and biodiversity across the Group. We also participated in a

meeting of the TNFD Consultation Group of Japan established in June

2022. In addition, referring to the LEAP approach

(note) 

presented in the

framework beta version, we have started to analyze natural capital risks

together with Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, a member of the

forum. As a member of the forum, we will continue to actively participate in

discussions to further contribute to the realization of a sustainable

environment and society.

(note)

LEAP approach: An approach proposed as a practical risk assessment

method for natural capital and consists of four steps: Locate the contact

point between the company and nature, Evaluate the impact and

dependence on nature, Assess the risks and opportunities related to nature,

and Prepare business strategies and disclosures according to those risks

and opportunities.

Response to Aging Population & Low Birthrate

MUFG strives to enhance its financial products and services backed by comprehensive capabilities afforded by
the Group to meet evolving and diversifying customer needs in the face of changes in social structure due to the

aging population and low birthrate. We also engage in research and social contribution activities for the same
purpose.

Moreover, we are developing channels specifically designed to make access to our services easier for elderly
customers. At the same time, we constantly work to enhance customer convenience by upgrading our apps and

other digital-driven tools supporting non-face-to-face channels to improve their operability and design.

Main Initiatives

Main Initiatives in Each Issue Category

Succession of Businesses and Assets

Employing functions afforded by the Group as well as networks offered by our alliance partners, we deliver
proposals regarding M&A, inheritance, real estate and asset management by taking a groupwide, integrated

29

approach. Through these endeavors, we support the succession of assets and businesses worth more than ¥1

trillion on an annual basis Furthermore, we began offering foreign currency-denominated insurance with a lump-

sum premium for people seeking protection after bereavement. 

 This insurance is equipped with a joint policy

(note)

and thus provides an effective solution for secondary inheritance, which often becomes an issue in the course of

asset succession. In these and other ways, we strive to enhance our lineup of products and services designed to

support the smooth succession of businesses and assets.

(note)

A type of insurance enabling two individuals to be insured with a single policy

Development of the MUFG Wealth Management Digital Platform (WMPF)

MUFG Wealth Management aims to be a

trusted brand that can serve as a good

partner to support customers' lives for

generations to come and to provide Group-

wide comprehensive solutions, from banking

and trust to securities, to our customers so

that they can achieve true wealth at various

stages of their lives.

Utilizing the WMPF, a digital tool released in

February 2022 which is used throughout the

entire Group, we will come to understand

customers' life goals and propose optimal

solutions based on their total assets using

MUFG Inheritance Research Institute

the Group's comprehensive strengths to meet the diverse needs of individuals, their families, and businesses,

such as asset succession, business succession, and asset management.

MUFG Inheritance Research Institute

The Trust Bank has established the MUFG Inheritance Research Institute in order to conduct research studies on

asset management for an aging society and on smooth transfer of assets to the next generation.

In fiscal 2021, we held our first inheritance symposium based on an awareness survey on inheritance with the

theme of asset succession in the era of the 100-year life society. We also exchanged opinions on future initiatives

including IT utilization in industry, government, and academia, focusing on the issues that an aging society faces,

such as deterioration in cognitive and judgmental functions. Going forward, we will continue to provide practical

information from a neutral standpoint with the aim of resolving social issues, such as smooth asset management

and asset succession, through symposiums and the publication of various reports and columns.

Started Tsunageru Toshin Service (Gift During Life/Asset Succession)

In July 2022, the Trust Bank started new Tsunageru
Toshin service (gift during life/asset succession)
designed for individual customers.

(cid:20)0

It is a new service that contributes to the realization

of long-term asset management through two

approaches: Gift during life, which allows the

younger generation without sufficient funds to

invest due to education and housing expenses, to

start investing in investment trusts early on by using

gifted funds; and asset succession, which allows

the next generation to continue managing

investment trusts without having to convert

inherited investment trusts into cash at time of inheritance.

Response to the Elderly

Today, the value of financial assets held by elderly citizens has grown bigger than ever before, while an

increasing number of people suffer from dementia. Aware of these circumstances, we offer not only trust

products that serve as solutions for testament formulation and the advancement of assets but also robust

services to help mitigate our customers’ looming sense of anxiety at the prospect of a possible aging-related

cognitive deterioration. For example, in 2019 we released Tsukaete Anshin, a trust product with proxy withdrawal

functions. The number of applicants for this product is now in excess of 8,000. 

(note)

Moreover, we endeavor to ensure that elderly customers can always enjoy access to safe and secure services.

To this end, we promote training aimed at securing employee capabilities to accommodate customers with

dementia. Today, more than 23,000 employees have been certified as dementia supporters.

The Trust Bank has established the MUFG Inheritance Research Institute in order to conduct research studies on

asset management for an aging society and on smooth transfer of assets to the next generation.

In fiscal 2021, we held our first inheritance symposium based on an awareness survey on inheritance with the

theme of asset succession in the era of the 100-year life society. We also exchanged opinions on future initiatives

including IT utilization in industry, government, and academia, focusing on the issues that an aging society faces,

such as deterioration in cognitive and judgmental functions. Going forward, we will continue to provide practical

information from a neutral standpoint with the aim of resolving social issues, such as smooth asset management

and asset succession, through symposiums and the publication of various reports and columns.

Started Tsunageru Toshin Service (Gift During Life/Asset Succession)

In July 2022, the Trust Bank started new Tsunageru
Toshin service (gift during life/asset succession)
designed for individual customers.
It is a new service that contributes to the realization

of long-term asset management through two
approaches: Gift during life, which allows the
younger generation without sufficient funds to
invest due to education and housing expenses, to
start investing in investment trusts early on by using

gifted funds; and asset succession, which allows
the next generation to continue managing

investment trusts without having to convert
inherited investment trusts into cash at time of inheritance.

Response to the Elderly

Today, the value of financial assets held by elderly citizens has grown bigger than ever before, while an
increasing number of people suffer from dementia. Aware of these circumstances, we offer not only trust
products that serve as solutions for testament formulation and the advancement of assets but also robust
services to help mitigate our customers’ looming sense of anxiety at the prospect of a possible aging-related
cognitive deterioration. For example, in 2019 we released Tsukaete Anshin, a trust product with proxy withdrawal
functions. The number of applicants for this product is now in excess of 8,000. 
Moreover, we endeavor to ensure that elderly customers can always enjoy access to safe and secure services.

Financial Gerontology

The Trust Bank is conducting research on financial gerontology, the study of how changes in cognitive function

due to aging affect economic activity and financial behavior, and is researching services that enable the elderly to

use their assets in the way they desire. Through this research, we will develop products that prepare for cognitive
decline and contribute to the health and longevity of our customers.

In addition, we are working to commercialize new products and services designed to deliver solutions to issues

arising from an aging society so that we can deliver even better services to our customers in the future. These

efforts include the development of technologies to assess cognitive functions and a system to verify testament

content comprehension. To that end, we launch a verification testing project by fiscal 2022 as part of an industry-

academia research collaboration.

Excellent Club

As people's lifespan increases, customers’ specific situations and needs related to their life plans are becoming
(cid:20)1
more diverse, and financial institutions are expected to respond not only with financial services but also with

comprehensive responses, including alliances with non-financial service providers.

With this backdrop, in August 2022, the Bank launched the MUFG Bank Excellence Club, a free membership

service based on the concept of “making 100 years of life 100 years of happiness.” In addition to providing

information such as bulletins and seminars, as well as providing MUFG financial services, we also offer non-

financial services that enrich our customers' daily lives and support healthy lifestyles.

Asset Building

MUFG offers consulting on asset management for customers from diverse age groups while offering an extensive

lineup of pension asset management and consulting functions for corporate clients.

In June 2021, we released “D-Canvas,” a smartphone app enabling persons enrolled in the defined contribution

pension plans of our corporate clients to confirm the balance of plan assets and change products under our

administration. In December 2021, we also released “Money Canvas,” a one-stop platform through which users
can enjoy access to a diverse range of financial products supporting asset building. Going forward, we will
enhance UI/UX offered through our services and otherwise upgrade our service infrastructure. By doing so, we
will empower all our customers, irrespective of their age, to gain smooth access to our asset building solutions.

MUFG Financial Education Institute

The Trust Bank established the MUFG Financial Education Institute for the purpose of providing practical and

effective information on asset building and asset management from a neutral standpoint.

In fiscal 2021, we conducted surveys on the topics of “Awareness of Sustainability and Consumption/Investment

Behavior” and “Changes in Behavior and Investment Conditions during the COVID-19 Pandemic”. In order to

make the survey results widely available to customers, we disseminated information through various means,

including the publication of research reports on our website and by holding a symposium.

The symposium, which was held in February 2022, introduced the results of the survey and provided an

opportunity to think together with experts about what is expected to the financial institutions from the perspective

of asset formation and investment dissemination as society moves toward sustainability (SDGs, ESG, etc.). In

addition, the panel discussed other topics, such as sustainable investment that resonates with individual

customers and the nature of a trusted financial institution. In the questionnaire provided on the day of the

seminar, about 80% of the respondents answered that the seminar was “Very helpful/Helpful.”

Support for Next Generation

Taking full advantage of its financial expertise,

MUFG provides financial and economic education

to young people. At the same time, we are actively

supporting the sound upbringing of children and

assisting students in their pursuit of higher

education through donations and other means.

For example, MUMSS has been upholding a policy

of contributing to society through the provision of

financial and economic education, to this end

offering on-demand classes at junior and senior

high schools. Recently, MUMSS developed a new

educational program for use in elementary schools

generations.

and has started providing the program to enhance the capacity of children, who will be leaders of the future

Diversity is an important value that gives us the resilience we need to cope with times of change. At MUFG, we
are working to create a workplace where diverse employees can work with vitality and fulfillment. We are also

contributing to the promotion of Inclusion & Diversity in the world through our financial functions.

Main Initiatives

Inclusion & Diversity Initiatives

MUFG focuses on Inclusion and Diversity as one of the 10 Priority Issues in sustainability management.

In 2006, MUFG established a dedicated department to promote diversity as a corporate management strategy

under the commitment of the top management. In particular, we consider the promotion of diversity from the

viewpoint of gender to be an important issue, and we are working to develop the ability of women and promote

their appointment in higher positions.

Our three main subsidiaries, the Bank, the Trust Bank and the Securities, set joint targets and report progress

regularly at the executive committee.

In 2018, the Group started the integrated operation of the corporate center function. The three companies gather

and work together to promote inclusion & diversity within the Group.

At the annual HR exchange meetings, people from HR departments of about 40 Group companies gather to

share best practices and issues. By doing so, the Group companies are in full coordination and promote inclusion
& diversity effectively.
In addition, we have assigned staff in charge of promoting Inclusion & Diversity in each region to effectively
address each issue under global cooperation.

MUFG's Thinking on Inclusion & Diversity

At MUFG, our vision for promoting Inclusion & Diversity is identified as "Enlighten, Encourage, Empower - Work

together as a Group to exceed customer expectations."
A chemical reaction occurs as diverse employees respect each other’s differences, make the most of each

other’s characteristics, and grow with each other. New ideas and behavioral patterns born from this chemical
reaction will help us create a free and vigorous culture and value that exceed the expectations of society and

customers.
In order for MUFG to be committed to empowering a brighter future, we believe that investment in Inclusion &

Diversity is essential.

Our history of Inclusion & Diversity Initiatives

Our initiatives since 2006 are as shown below. Initially, our main objective was to improve the job satisfaction of
female employees, However, since 2010, we have expanded the scope of our initiatives with the aim of improving
the job satisfaction of not only female employees but also diverse employees. Moving forward, we will further
focus our efforts on creating workplaces where all employees of the Group can demonstrate their unique
strengths and make diversity empower a brighter future.

MUFG’s compensation system for Executives, etc. is not only aimed at ensuring the achievement of short-term

performance targets but also intended to better incentivize these individuals to contribute to a medium- to long-

term improvement in corporate value and encourage them to take on the challenge of driving innovation.

In FY2022, we also added inclusion & diversity targets to qualitative assessment indicators for determining the

amount of bonuses vis-à-vis the execution status of the recipients’ duties, in order to facilitate management

efforts to promote and secure the robust employee understanding of inclusion & diversity.

Raising the Target for the Ratio of Women in Management in Japan from 18% to 20%

At the Bank, the Trust Bank and the Securities, our joint

numerical goal is to raise the ratio of women holding

positions of line manager or higher to 20% in Japan by the

end of March 2024. This figure is to reflect diverse

perspectives and values in areas closer to management,

and serves as a milestone to achieve at least 30% in the

medium- to long-term. In addition to the joint numerical

targets of the three companies, each company has set its

own numerical targets to promote the appointment of

female employees.

* Ratio of women in line manager or higher positions.

Encouraging Male Employees to Participate in Childcare

In order to create workplace environments that allow

employees to balance work and childcare regardless of

gender, MUFG Group companies are carrying out

initiatives to encourage male employees to take childcare

leave, thereby raising awareness on more balanced work

styles and promoting better understanding of colleagues

who are working while raising children. Since FY2019, we

have begun encouraging male employees to take

childcare leave of about one month, among other

initiatives.

Active Participation of People with Disabilities

We are expanding roles for employees with disabilities by establishing special subsidiaries that offer suitable

work options. Currently, about 1,400 employees with disabilities are playing an active role within MUFG and the

MUFG clearly prohibits any harassment or discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender
identity, aiming to create workplaces where all employees can stay true to themselves, regardless of sexual

orientation, gender identity, etc.
Through initiatives such as providing training opportunities, publishing a handbook, and introducing a same-sex

partnership recognition program, we are promoting understanding of LGBTQ within MUFG and are also working
to raise awareness of society in cooperation with other financial institutions.

Active Participation of Senior Personnel

MUFG actively supports the creation of workplaces where senior personnel can flourish, continuing to make the

most of their wealth of experience and abilities while supporting their own career development. For employees
who have reached a particular age, we have introduced training and programs to facilitate skill development with

the aim of supporting future career development based on diverse values. For motivated employees above
retirement age, we have established a continuous employment system with flexible work arrangements to

provide stable work opportunities and respond to diverse employment needs.

Nurturing Global Human Resources

Today, the MUFG Group has expanded into more than 50 countries around the globe, and approximately 58% of
its entire workforce is accounted for by overseas employees (as of May 31,2022). Based on the concept of
"inclusion & diversity", which is one of MUFG's priority issues, in order to recruit and develop a diverse range of
professionals, it is necessary to foster our corporate brand both in Japan and overseas so that people will want to
work for MUFG.
MUFG is expanding opportunities for employees to play an even more active role by operating a market-standard
and globally unif ied human resources platform for title management, employee evaluation, wage determination
and other human resources practices.

External Evaluation

As a result of various initiatives, MUFG was chosen for the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index developed by

Bloomberg LP, Nadeshiko Brand and Semi-Nadeshiko Brand under the program sponsored by the Ministry of

Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange, as well as the Gold and Best Practice in LGBTQ

initiative evaluation PRIDE Index.

Issuance of Gender Bonds by Krungsri (Bank of Ayudhya)

Krungsri (Bank of Ayudhya), our Partner Bank in
Thailand, has issued social bonds (gender bonds)

to support the financial needs of women
entrepreneurs.

Proceeds from the bond issuance are used to
finance women-led small and medium-sized
enterprises in Thailand.  Through the issuance of
these bonds, the bank provided opportunities for
the underserved women in SME segment to access

financial services and contributed to the
development of the fast-growing social bond market

in Asia.
Through the provision of these bonds, Krungsri was
presented with multiple awards and recognition as below.

Donations for Supporting Women's Health

As part of our efforts to support women's health, we
made a donation to the Japan Society of Fertility
Preservation in order to spread accurate
information on breast cancer and cervical cancer
(methods for early detection and prevention, etc.).

In recent years, cancers specific to women have

become more common among younger ages, with

an increasing number of cases occurring in their

20s to 40s. Amongst them, breast cancer is the

most common followed by cervical cancer.
Continuous medical examinations are important for

early detection of cancer. In particular, the medical

examination rate of cervical cancer, which occurs among those in their 20s and requires screening at a young

age, is as low as 25.7%. Also, the HPV vaccination rate is low.
MUFG believes that it is important to realize a society in which women can build life plans with peace of mind and
play active roles in various situations. Through the Japan Society of Fertility Preservation, MUFG will promote
early detection and prevention methods such as continuous medical examinations for cancer among young
women.

the development of water-related infrastructure, and the construction of hospitals.

Main Initiatives

Supporting Every Business Stage

Hosting of “MUFG ICJ ESG Accelerator,” the First ESG Accelerator Program in
Japan’s Banking Industry

In tandem with Inclusion Japan, Inc., which is engaged in ESG investment in the venture field, we held “MUFG
ICJ ESG Accelerator,” the first ESG accelerator program in Japan’s banking industry. This program is aimed at
facilitating collaboration across a range of players from startups and business corporations to venture capital and
other investors in order to accelerate business development endeavors toward the realization of carbon-neutral
and circular economies. Of 98 venture startups applying for this program, 14 companies were selected as
finalists. MUFG has since engaged these companies in discussions alongside its cosponsoring partners to co-
create new businesses.
Going forward, MUFG will help startups move forward steadily toward the commercialization of their endeavors,

working in tandem with them to assist their efforts to discover growth opportunities and launch innovative

businesses.

Holding the Nineth Rise Up Festa

As part of these efforts, since 2014 we have held

Rise Up Festa inwhich we take full advantage of

our network and abundant knowhowin

management support and other fields to assist

venturestartups that take on novel or unique

business endeavors over themedium- to long-term.

At the 9th Rise Up Festa in 2022, we solicited a

wide range of business proposals in fields that are

expected to grow in the future. Of the more than

150 business plans submitted, eight plans were

awarded for their originality and appeal.

Offering of a Business Platform for Corporate Customers

In partnership with BusinessTech Co., Ltd., NTT Data Corporation, and Salesforce Japan Co., Ltd., MUFG Bank

began offering a business platform for corporate customers aimed at regional financial institutions in June 2022.

The business platform for corporate customers is a new comprehensive financial service platform that provides,

in addition to the financial solutions and information content having been provided by financial institutions so far,

solutions that contribute to solving issues in non-financial areas, such as DX, ESG, and regional revitalization. By

utilizing this platform, regional financial institutions will be able to provide solutions easily and collectively to the

various management and social issues faced by their business partners.

Promoting Financing for Overseas Startups

Mars Growth Capital

Mars Growth Capital, a joint venture established by the Bank and an Israel-based fintech company Liquidity

Capital, provides debt finance to startups in Asia Pacific and Europe by utilizing a unique AI credit scoring model.
Growing start-ups often have difficulty borrowing from financial institutions due to their short business history and

loss-making nature in their growth stage. However, Mars Growth Capital uses AI to evaluate a company's growth
potential and make loans possible. Since its launch in 2020, Mars Growth Capital has grown steadily with two

funds currently in operation: The first fund is for mid-stage companies (US $200 million) and the second fund for
late-stage companies (US $300 million).

MUFG Ganesha Fund

In March 2022, we established the MUFG Ganesha Fund with an investment commitment of US $300 million

designed for startups in India. Through this fund, the Bank will invest in middle- to late-stage Indian startups.
India, aided by strong economic growth, has seen an increase in the number of startups leveraging digital

technology, given the rise of young digital natives in the country, the rapid spread of the Internet, and the
promotion of governmental policies that support digitalization.

We will further contribute to the development of new industries and the sustainable development by financially
supporting the growth of startups that use technology to solve environmental and social issues.

Support for Regional Revitalization

MUIC Kansai Innovation Center Recognized as an "Outstanding Initiative” of a
Financial Institution that Contributes to Regional Revitalization

to solve issues in the tourism industry and revitalize the Kansai economy.
The core function of MUIC Kansai is a “problem-solving programs” aimed at creating innovation, and MUIC
Kansai provides a platform that can identify social issues to be solved, conduct a PoC, and implement the
solutions in society in an integrated manner. In addition, the facility is equipped with co-working spaces and

shared offices, available forvarious relevant events to provide opportunities for new business matching for co-

creation from the perspective of both hardware and software.

contributing to regional revitalization by the Council for the Realization of the Digital Rural City State Concept,

Cabinet Secretariat and MUFG received an award from the Minister of State for Special Missions (regional

industry is seeing the creation of new and varied market demand and its potential is expanding. However, on the

business front, the industry is faced with a number of challenges, including a shortage of accommodation due to

an aging and insufficient supply of facilities, the graying of facility operators and a pressing need for management

succession planning. Regional businesses are also being called upon to develop new sightseeing resources

and meet increasingly diverse tourist needs.

Promoting Workstyle Reforms

As we aim to enable employees to realize their full potential, we have promoted the revision of administrative
procedures and the streamlining of meeting practices while going paperless and developing infrastructure for

remote working. By doing so, we help employees allocate more time to engaging in direct communications with
customers and taking on new challenges. 

We are pushing ahead with expanding the scope of banking procedures that can be completed online, believing
that improving the efficiency of our financial functions, which constitute a part of social infrastructure, will help

society as a whole achieve higher productivity, in addition to making us more productive.

MUFG implements “MUFG SOUL”, a framework in

which employees are invited to submit passionate

and original ideas for CSR activities with MUFG

providing financial support for these activities. This

is designed to encourage employees to set their

sights higher regarding what they can do for the

public good and to take tangible action. This

contributes to the resolution of a wide range of

social issues by addressing them from the
perspective of employees.
Utilizing this framework, MUFG supported several
Kodomo Shokudo (volunteer-run cafeterias that
provide free or inexpensive meals to children) through monetary and food donations.

Children's Poverty Symposium

We held an in-house symposium on children's

poverty, inviting representatives from Learning for
All (NPO) and Chance for Children as well as

experts from Mitsubishi UFJ Research and
Consulting. In addition to an overview of the reality
of child poverty in Japan and its impact on society,
the activities of each organization were introduced.
At the end of the event, speakers answered

questions from the participant employees, helping
them deepen their knowledge of the social issue of

child poverty as well as providing an opportunity to
think about social issues.

Reduction of Educational Disparities

Believing that proper education is the bedrock of a stable society and empowers it to achieve sustainable

economic development, we provide financial and economic education to help raise the general public’s financial
literacy as part of our mission as a financial institution. Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are

more focused than ever before on offering educational assistance as the number of young people found to be
negatively affected by inequality in educational opportunities has been growing amid the pandemic’s fallout.

Contributing to Improving the Quality of Education

MUFG donated to Teach For Japan, an NPO that supports a fellowship
program to send skilled individuals with outstanding qualifications and

abilities in the educational field as teachers to schools for two years.

Supporting the Fight Against the COVID-19 Pandemic

In order to support children who have no choice but to abandon their

studies for economic reasons and who have lost their parents due to
illness or disaster, MUFG donated a total of 1 billion yen to the Ashinaga

Scholarship Foundation and Japan Educational Exchanges and Services.

Elevating Disadvantaged Young People through ‘Mentoring Works’ Programme

MUFG London branch has been collaborating with BIG Alliance and its
flagship education program “Mentoring Works”. Since 2013, the program
has supported students from the local community ‘Islington’, where an
estimated 47.5% of children live in poverty.
The programme focuses on local under-served young people, who are
more likely to Not be in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) in
comparison to their peers from other London districts with the same
qualifications.
The impact of coronavirus continues to widen the educational gap, making

this initiative even more important.

‘Mentoring Works’ matches students to volunteer mentors working in local

corporates such as MUFG. The programme offers students vital

employability focused insight that supports them to acquire the knowledge

and skills necessary to succeed in the ever-changing job market.

So far, 285 MUFG mentors participated since 2013. Over the years, they

encouraged young people to expand their visions of what they want to

achieve in life and career regardless of their socio-economic backgrounds.

Support from the MUFG-UNESCO Association Great East Japan Earthquake
Reconstruction Scholarship Fund

In April 2011, MUFG established the MUFG-UNESCO Association Great East Japan Earthquake Recovery and

Scholarship Fund to provide continuous support through a scholarship program for children and students who
55
lost their parents in natural disasters. The total amount of the fund is estimated to be approximately three billion
yen.

Supporting Provision of Essential Medicines to Low- and Middle-Income Countries

Sanofi, based in France, is a leading global healthcare company actively involved in the research, development,

manufacturing, and marketing of therapeutic solutions. Sanofi products are sold in over 170 countries.
Sanofi’s integrated social impact strategy aims to build a healthier, more resilient world by ensuring access to

healthcare for the world’s poorest people.
In March 2022, MUFG acted as an active bookrunner for Sanofi’s inaugural Sustainability Linked Bond (EUR 650

million, seven-year tenor). This financing is designed to link the future interest rates with the success of  Sanofi
Global Health’s (Sanofi’s non-profit Business Unit) provision of essential medicines to at least 1.5 million patients

between January 2022 and December 2026 (cumulative) in low-income and lower-middle-income countries.

Support for the Long-Term Fight Against the COVID-19 Pandemic

As the Covid-19 Pandemic continues, MUFG has continued to provide support in the fields of medicine and the

arts in response to the widespread and profound impact that it has had on society and the economy.

Medical field
Due to the spread of Covid-19, there are serious
concerns about a shortage of medical care. MUFG
donated approximately 400 million yen to the All
Japan Hospital Association to support hospital
personnel who are on the front lines providing
medical examinations and treatment. Through this
association, MUFG recruit hospitals that need
support, and contribute to maintaining and
strengthening a stable local medical care provision
system.

Art and cultural fields
Due to the impact of Covid-19, many classical
music performances have been canceled or
postponed, and audience capacity has been limited
for concerts. In FY 2021, MUFG donated 300 million yen to the Association of Japanese Symphony Orchestras
to support music and art activities that enrich people’s spirits and lives. The funds will be used to support the
activities of the 37 member organizations.

Krungsri Breast Cancer Awareness’

Krungsri (Bank of Ayudhya) has been involved in

diverse activities to ensure health and high-quality

healthcare as well as promoting well-being of the

local community and their employees.
In collaboration with Thanyarak Foundation,
Krungsri has provided free breast cancer
screenings for disadvantaged women, as well as
supporting creation of online media which aims to
enhance knowledge of the breast self-examination. 

This online media will be delivered to public health service centers, to increase awareness for breast cancer.

Highlights

In order to contribute to the achievement of a sustainable society, MUFG has identif ied climate change measures
& environmental protection as one of its priority environmental and social issues.

Acutely aware of the importance of climate-related f inancial disclosure, MUFG has declared its support of
relevant recommendations formulated by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a

special taskforce established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB). In line with these recommendations for
disclosure of climate change-related risks and opportunities in its Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and
Metrics and Targets, TCFD is pursuing the following.

Status of Response to TCFD Recommendations

Governance 

Disclose the organization's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.

a．Describe the board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.
b．Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.

● Governance to deal with climate change  - the Board of Directors supervises climate change-related initiatives -

Opportunities and risks related to the environment and society, including climate change, are regularly

discussed by the Sustainability Committee under the Executive Committee. Depending on the theme, matters

are also reviewed by the Credit & Investment Management Committee, Credit Committee, and Risk

Management Committee also under the Executive Committee. The contents of the review by the committees

are reported to the Executive Committee and then to the Board of Directors to be reviewed.

The contents of the review by the Credit & Investment Management Committee and the Risk Management

Committee are reported to the Board of Directors after being reviewed by the Risk Committee, which is

composed mainly of outside directors.

● Established the MUFG Environmental Policy Statement, the action guideline for environmental considerations
(May 2018)

To be determined by the Board of Directors from May 2021: Clearly stated the commitment to proactively

・In November 2021, we joined the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) to accelerate our efforts.
Set interim targets for 2030 by October 2022.

Other Efforts 
・Krungsri announced their Carbon Neutrality Vision (Krungsri has committed to decarbonization of own
emissions by 2030 and decarbonization of financial services by 2050.) 
・Revision of the MUFG Environmental and Social Policy Framework. Tightened the Policy Framework,
including prohibition of financing to new thermal coal mining projects for power generation.

● Enhancement of system for promoting sustainable business

By bringing together MUFG's expertise in sustainability both in Japan and overseas, the Sustainable Business
Division was established in July 2021 to support the sustainable growth of customers by providing various

types of information and solutions from the standpoint of solving environmental and social issues.

MUFG aims to support customer efforts to transform business models as well as the climate transition of
whole industries toward carbon neutrality. To this end, we provide solutions designed to assist customers in

their pursuit of transition and innovation aimed at promoting decarbonization. In the aspect of financing, we
constantly endeavor to upgrade our sustainable financial products and services to support customers’
decarbonization efforts.

The Energy Transformation Strategy Project Team (EX Strategy PT) was established to examine how the
entire financial sector can contribute to the energy transformation of our customers. Monthly meetings are held
with about 300 employees from sales divisions to engage in dialog with customers, industry associations, and
government agencies to develop strategies.

We have built a system to consolidate useful information and business opportunities through the Global ESG
Conference, held with ESG promotion officers located in Europe, the Americas, and Asia.

● Engagement activities based on the needs of customers

Through the EX Strategy PT, we promote engagement based on the issues and needs of each customer.

Engagement activities are conducted with approximately 550 Japanese and non-Japanese customers.

● Development and provision of decarbonization solutions based on the needs of customers

This includes support for visualizing GHG emissions, support for strategy formulation through TCFD consulting

services, support for investments and loans through financing, and the deployment of overseas carbon credits

to Japanese companies.

● Risks and opportunities related to climate change

As for risks related to climate change, based on TCFD recommendations, we have expanded the classification

of risks, organized cases of transition risks and physical risks, and expanded disclosure.

・Our corporate clients’
business activities and
financial positions may be
negatively affected if they
cannot deal with government

policies, regulatory

・In November 2021, we joined the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) to accelerate our efforts.

Set interim targets for 2030 by October 2022.

6.

Other Efforts 

・Krungsri announced their Carbon Neutrality Vision (Krungsri has committed to decarbonization of own

emissions by 2030 and decarbonization of financial services by 2050.) 

・Revision of the MUFG Environmental and Social Policy Framework. Tightened the Policy Framework,

including prohibition of financing to new thermal coal mining projects for power generation.

● Enhancement of system for promoting sustainable business

By bringing together MUFG's expertise in sustainability both in Japan and overseas, the Sustainable Business

Division was established in July 2021 to support the sustainable growth of customers by providing various

types of information and solutions from the standpoint of solving environmental and social issues.

MUFG aims to support customer efforts to transform business models as well as the climate transition of

whole industries toward carbon neutrality. To this end, we provide solutions designed to assist customers in

their pursuit of transition and innovation aimed at promoting decarbonization. In the aspect of financing, we

constantly endeavor to upgrade our sustainable financial products and services to support customers’

decarbonization efforts.

The Energy Transformation Strategy Project Team (EX Strategy PT) was established to examine how the

entire financial sector can contribute to the energy transformation of our customers. Monthly meetings are held

with about 300 employees from sales divisions to engage in dialog with customers, industry associations, and

government agencies to develop strategies.

We have built a system to consolidate useful information and business opportunities through the Global ESG

Conference, held with ESG promotion officers located in Europe, the Americas, and Asia.

● Engagement activities based on the needs of customers

Through the EX Strategy PT, we promote engagement based on the issues and needs of each customer.

Engagement activities are conducted with approximately 550 Japanese and non-Japanese customers.

● Development and provision of decarbonization solutions based on the needs of customers

This includes support for visualizing GHG emissions, support for strategy formulation through TCFD consulting

services, support for investments and loans through financing, and the deployment of overseas carbon credits

to Japanese companies.

MUFG's Governance for Countering Climate Change -Board Oversight of Climate
Change Initiatives-

MUFG's Governance Structure for Countering Climate Change

At MUFG, the Sustainability Committee, which operates under the Executive Committee, is charged with

periodically deliberating policies on and determining the status of the Group's response to opportunities and risks
arising from climate change and other environmental and social concerns.

MUFG has positioned climate change-related risk as one of the Top Risks that it must pay close attention to.
Accordingly, these risks are discussed by the Credit & Investment Management Committee, the Credit

Committee and the Risk Management Committee, all of which are under the direct supervision of the Executive
Committee.

Conclusions reached by the above committees are reported to the Executive Committee‒which is tasked with
deliberating and making decisions on important matters regarding business execution‒and, ultimately, reported to
and discussed by the Board of Directors. In addition, matters discussed by the Credit & Investment Management
Committee and the Risk Management Committee are also examined by the Risk Committee, which mainly
consists of outside directors, and then reported to the Board of Directors. In these ways, the Board of Directors
exercises supervision over MUFG's climate change-related initiatives.
Specif ically, the Board of Directors handles issues requiring a groupwide perspective and, to this end, identifies
important themes deserving intensive discussion, thereby managing these issues based on a PDCA cycle in
accordance with an annual schedule.
Also, sustainability management is considered an important theme. The Board of Directors actively addresses
matters related to this theme through dedicated sessions in addition to deliberations at regular Board meetings.

MUFG has revised its executive compensation system to achieve the medium-term business plan and implement
sustainability management, and has newly installed a heightened metric for ESG-related external ratings as a

medium- to long-term performance-linked indicator for stock-based compensation.

 for executive compensation. The intention is to align MUFG's corporate activities

(note) MSCI, FTSE Russell, Sustainalytics, S&P Dow Jones, CDP

1.

To incentivize efforts to improve MUFG’s earnings power, capital efficiency and profit structure, each of which
is considered a management issue requiring the utmost priority, the degree of achievement vis-à-vis target

levels stipulated in the Medium-Term Business Plan (MTBP) regarding consolidated ROE and consolidated

expense reduction (excluding performance-linked expense) is determined on an absolute evaluation basis.

2.

In addition to incentivizing recipients to advance sustainability management, the degree of improvement in

external ratings granted by the five major ESG rating agencies (MSCI, FTSE Russell, Sustainalytics, S&P

Dow Jones and CDP) is determined on an absolute evaluation basis, with the aim of objectively assessing

the recipient’s contribution to MUFG’s initiatives to address ESG issues in a variety of fields.

3.

4.

Relative comparisons with competitors are made with Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial

Group.

ESG-related assessment items subject to qualitative evaluation include contribution to the resolution of
environmental and social concerns, the promotion of inclusion & diversity and the strengthening and
upgrading of MUFG’s governance structure.

Under the MUFG Way, which guides all of our

activities, MUFG has established the MUFG
Environmental Policy Statement as a specific action

guideline for practicing environmental
considerations.

The MUFG Environmental Policy Statement has
been the matter to be determined in the Board of
Directors since May 2021. The Policy Statement
clearly states the company's commitment to
proactively disclose information on the environment, including climate change.

MUFG Carbon Neutrality Declaration

In April 2021, we defined our purpose as being “Committed to empowering a brighter future.” Since then, we
have been implementing our medium-term business plan, led by a heightened commitment to helping resolve
environmental and social issues.
To better contribute to building a sustainable environment and society, MUFG has selected 10 priority

environmental and social issues with an eye on better fulfilling society’s expectations in areas where MUFG’s

strengths can be applied. One of the priorities we especially focus on is climate change measures and
environmental protection.
We have always been proactive in addressing climate change and environmental protection issues. It included
formulating the MUFG Environmental and Social Policy Framework for assessing and managing the risks

associated with our business activities as well as setting sustainable finance targets. During this period, the

movement to combat climate change gained tremendous global momentum, as can be seen, for example, by the

Japanese government’s Carbon Neutrality Declaration. MUFG has taken another step forward by announcing the

MUFG Carbon Neutrality Declaration in May 2021. Guided by this declaration, MUFG is implementing group-

wide environmental measures globally, aiming to achieve net zero GHG emissions from the financed portfolio by

2050 and net zero GHG emissions from our own operations by 2030.

In the MUFG Progress Report issued in April 2022, we reported on the progress of MUFG's carbon neutrality

initiatives and the measures that we are taking. In addition to the results and targets, we also reported on our

approach to achieving them and our thought process on which they are based. Through sharing the concept of

MUFG‘s initiatives in detail, we hope to work together with wide range of stakeholders to achieve a sustainable
environment and society.

2030 Interim Targets

MUFG joined NZBA in June 2021 after announcing the Carbon Neutrality Declaration. NZBA members share a

common goal: net zero financed portfolios by 2050. They are also required to set interim targets for 2030 or

earlier using a science-based approach.

We are committed to helping achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement by achieving carbon neutrality by 2050,

and at the same time, supporting a smooth transition to a decarbonized society through our financial services,

and proactively contributing to creating a sustainable society by fostering a virtuous cycle between the

environment and the economy. Today, we have set interim targets for 2030, aligned with the Paris Agreement.

We recognize that the processes for achieving these targets vary depending on the characteristics of each region

and business. We are also aware that our business is greatly affected by geopolitical risks and other factors, so

we will share issues that we find through engagement (dialogue) with customers and support them to help

resolve these issues.

Innovations which are still in the conceptual stage is another indispensable element for the world to achieve

decarbonization. We believe that there is a gap between the real world and the goal that is yet to be materialized.

Therefore, our aspiration is to further contribute to the changes where the world advances more towards

decarbonization by developing research on new technologies for implementation.

To reflect our stance mentioned above, we have set ranged interim targets in order to work together with our

stakeholders to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050.

2030 Interim Targets

MUFG joined NZBA in June 2021 after announcing the Carbon Neutrality Declaration. NZBA members share a
common goal: net zero financed portfolios by 2050. They are also required to set interim targets for 2030 or
earlier using a science-based approach.
We are committed to helping achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement by achieving carbon neutrality by 2050,
and at the same time, supporting a smooth transition to a decarbonized society through our financial services,
and proactively contributing to creating a sustainable society by fostering a virtuous cycle between the

and business. We are also aware that our business is greatly affected by geopolitical risks and other factors, so
we will share issues that we find through engagement (dialogue) with customers and support them to help

Innovations which are still in the conceptual stage is another indispensable element for the world to achieve
decarbonization. We believe that there is a gap between the real world and the goal that is yet to be materialized.
Therefore, our aspiration is to further contribute to the changes where the world advances more towards

decarbonization by developing research on new technologies for implementation.

To reflect our stance mentioned above, we have set ranged interim targets in order to work together with our

stakeholders to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050.

Net zero GHG Emissions from the Financed Portfolio

Net zero GHG emissions from the financed portfolio means decarbonizing the sector portfolio by

reducing the GHG (Scope3) generated through financing customers and projects.
GHG emissions from the financed portfolio are defined as “financed emissions”. This is the amount of
GHG emissions attributed to each financial institution through financing each customer or project.
MUFG uses the calculation model recommended by the PCAF. When calculating MUFG’s attribution
factor, while the PCAF guidelines recommend using outstanding amounts of loans and investments,

MUFG uses outstanding credit amount which includes the undrawn amount of commitment in order to
reflect our credit stance as a financial institution more accurately.

Four Approaches to Setting the Interim Target

We have adopted the following four approaches to setting the interim target.

Going forward, we will reflect the changes in the IEA (International Energy Agency) scenario and various

guidelines, as well as the increase in the quality of data disclosed by our customers, as appropriate.

As a benchmark for 1.5°C, we will refer to scientific scenarios published by IEA and others.

We use the best available data to set targets. However, there are limits to the amount and quality of data

currently available, so we will use the PCAF data quality score to check the quality of emissions data disclosed

When data is updated or new data is disclosed, improvements in accuracy and quality will be reflected. MUFG

will also contribute to improving data accuracy by being highly transparent when disclosing information.

● Highly standardized and transparent

MUFG believes that targets should be set from a global perspective using widely accepted and transparent

methods. We participate in various initiatives, collecting insights and reflecting them in the targets we set.

We will proceed with target setting, incorporating guidelines and rules developed by NZBA, PCAF, PACTA, and

SBTi etc., as well as the outcomes of the global working groups which we participate in.

● Sector-specific

Pathways and the methods to achieve carbon neutrality vary by sector, so for each sector we will take into

consideration the characteristics of the business, the guidelines and the targets set by each customer.

By taking this approach, MUFG will identify issues in each sector and support customers’ efforts for achieving

carbon neutrality.

Interim Target-setting Process

MUFG set current interim targets in accordance with the following process: (1) Identifying priority sectors, (2)

Sector analysis, (3) Determine methodologies and measure GHG emissions, and (4) Set interim targets.

Identifying Priority Sectors

The NZBA Guidelines define nine carbon-intensive sectors that should be prioritized when setting targets:

agriculture; aluminium; cement; coal; commercial & residential real estate; iron & steel; oil & gas; power
generation; and transport. Among these sectors, MUFG especially puts priority on the power and the oil & gas
sectors for the following reasons.

7(cid:20)

(1)

CO  emissions from the power sector account for approximately 40% of global CO  emissions. The power

2

2

sector is expected to take a leading role in promoting decarbonization across industries through

electrification.

(2)

Oil & gas are widely consumed by industry and households, accounting for approximately 50% of global

CO  emissions from fuels and therefore important for reducing GHG emissions from fossil fuels.

2

(3)

(4)

Both sectors have relatively large financed emissions in the MUFG portfolio.

Both sectors have relatively well-developed data and methodologies.

Sector Analysis

The Power Sector

In the transition stage to a decarbonized society, the demand for power is expected to increase due to economic

growth in developing countries and the electrification of industry. So, the power sector will need to shift to

renewable energy and low-carbon fuels, while ensuring a stable supply of energy

(cid:1602)note(cid:1603)

.

The policies and initiatives of each country are important because the business model of this sector is local and

therefore has particularly strong regional characteristics.

(note)

Electricity demand under the IEA 1.5°C scenario (IEA NZE scenario in which the increase in the global surface

temperature rise is limited to 1.5°C with a 50% or greater probability of success) is estimated to grow by 39% by 2030

and 166% by 2050 (compared with 2020).

For decarbonization, GHG emission reductions can be done through electrification of production processes,

CCUS, etc. (i.e. Scope 1, 2 of the upstream business). On the other hand, a large amount of this sector’s GHG

emissions is due to cross-industrial consumption (Scope 3), indicating that decarbonization in the oil & gas sector

cannot be achieved without industries and households transitioning away from fossil fuels.

The IEA figures suggest that currently there is a large gap between the demand (IEA APS scenario that is based

on the commitments announced by each country) and the 1.5°C scenario. It is important to promote

decarbonization in the demand sectors as well in order to close the gap between these two scenarios.

Following SBTi and PACTA, the value chain and emission scope which we cover is Scope1 of the power

generation business, which accounts for the majority of GHG emissions in this sector.
The power sector is expected to take a leading role in driving cross-industry decarbonization. GHG emission
intensity, a measure of emission efficiency, will be used as the metric because the power sector needs to support
the increasing electricity demand while simultaneously moving ahead with clean energy conversion.
The average PCAF score for the target portfolio that is included in the calculation is 2.4. In addition to information

disclosed by customers, we use data sources, including CDP and Bloomberg, etc. for GHG emission data. In

cases where GHG emission data is not available, we use production data obtained from these data sources as
well as emission intensity information obtained from IEA database, etc. to make estimates. Customers who do
75
not have GHG emission data or production data are excluded from the calculation, yet we manage to cover more
than 85% of our credit portfolio for this sector.

The Oil & Gas Sector

(cid:1566)Setting Interim Target

According to PACTA, upstream businesses of fossil fuel sectors are important as they have significant impact on
other segments down the value chain. Therefore MUFG focuses on the upstream of the value chain, which have
the largest environmental impact. The emission scope which we look into covers not only Scope1 and Scope2
but also Scope3, from which the majority of GHG emissions from this sector is generated.
We have chosen to use absolute GHG emissions as the target metric to directly capture fossil fuel burns

(Scope3) which are the main cause of GHG emissions.

The average PCAF score for the target portfolio that is included in the calculation is 2.6. In addition to information
disclosed by customers, we use data sources, including CDP and Bloomberg, etc. for GHG emission data. In
cases where GHG emission data is not available, we use production data obtained from these data sources as

7(cid:23)

well as emission intensity information obtained from IEA database, etc. to make estimates. Customers who do

not have GHG emission data or production data are excluded from the scope of calculation, yet we manage to

cover more than 85% of our credit portfolio for this sector.

Going forward, we will expand our target coverage and improve data quality reflected in our PCAF score in line

with enhanced data availability.

(cid:1566)Interim Target

The interim target for 2030 is 15%-28% reduction from 2019.

We will achieve 15% reduction by engaging with our customers and supporting their efforts in reducing GHG

emissions. 15% reduction is a level well below the IEA 2˚C scenario in 2030.

We aim for 28% reduction which is consistent with the IEA 1.5˚C scenario in 2030. However, to achieve this it is

essential for both the oil & gas sector (supply-side) and the industries (demand-side) to simultaneously

accelerate decarbonization. Therefore, we intend to achieve 28% reduction by making contribution to the world to

further advance toward decarbonization.

 
 
 
 
 
 
According to PACTA, upstream businesses of fossil fuel sectors are important as they have significant impact on

other segments down the value chain. Therefore MUFG focuses on the upstream of the value chain, which have

the largest environmental impact. The emission scope which we look into covers not only Scope1 and Scope2

but also Scope3, from which the majority of GHG emissions from this sector is generated.

Initiatives for Net Zero GHG Emissions in Our Own Operations by 2030

MUFG aims to achieve net-zero GHG emissions

(note1)

 in our own operations by 2030. Since the Carbon

Neutrality Declaration in May 2021, MUFG has reduced approximately 60% of domestic GHG emissions (which

is approximately 30% of global GHG emissions).

In addition to our initiatives to reduce energy use through continued energy conservation, we will reduce our

gasoline consumption by switching to electric vehicles (EVs) and promote the use of renewable energy sources

for electricity to become net zero for GHG emissions by 2030. We will also work to establish and introduce raw

green power

(note2)

 to directly contribute to an increase in renewable energy sources.

Overseas, while accumulating expertise from promoting domestic environmental initiatives and introducing

renewable energy at our European business locations, we will accelerate implementing specific measures, taking
into account the status of policies and systems to promote decarbonization in each country.

Scope 1 and Scope 2 in the GHG Protocol.

(note2)

Green power, generated from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and biomass (biological resources), is sent

directly from the power plant to the consumer. Customers can use green power directly as electricity for their own use,
rather than "deemed" to do so.

GHG Emission Results

To achieve net-zero GHG emissions in our own operations by 2030, MUFG has measured and aggregated its

own GHG emissions on a group and global basis since FY 2020.

In FY 2021, our own GHG emissions were approximately 249,000 tCO e (based on preliminary figures), which

2

was a reduction of 94,000 tCO e (approximately 27%) from the previous year. In FY 2022, we have already

2

reduced our domestic emissions by 33,000 tCO e, which is planned to be reflected in our FY 2022 emissions

2

results.

By emissions type, direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) were 35,000 tCO e (14%) and indirect GHG emissions

2

(Scope 2) were 214,000 tCO e (86%).

2

In FY 2021, the Bank obtained third-party verification for its own GHG emissions in Japan (non-consolidated

basis). Going forward, we aim to obtain third-party verification for GHG emissions on the group and global basis.

Switching to Renewable Electricity

By November 2021, the Bank, the Trust Bank, and the Securities  completed switching to 100% renewable

energy for their own domestic electricity contracts. Since the release of the MUFG Carbon Neutrality Declaration

in May 2021, we have reduced domestic emissions by approximately 60% (approximately 30% of global

emissions). In addition, we have also completed switching to renewable electricity at some sites in Europe and

Asia. In June 2022, NICOS and ACOM also completed switching to 100% renewable electricity. As a result, we
were able achieve 100% renewable electricity among all of MUFG's consolidated subsidiaries in Japan for their
own contracted electricity, ahead of our initial schedule.

Contribution to the Increase of Renewable Energy Sources in Japan

MUFG has entered a long-term PPA contract to purchase electricity from solar power generation facilities
79
established by other companies  and implemented self-consignment, whereby MUFG installs its own solar power
generation facilities and consumes the electricity produced. Through these efforts, we have introduced what is

referred to as "raw green power" for a portion of the electricity used at our business locations and data centers.

At the same time, MUFG itself is involved in the construction of new power generation facilities and purchases

renewable power generated from these under long-term contracts, which allows MUFG to directly contributes to

the increase in the number of renewable power sources, which can be extended to across Japan.

Examples of the introduction of "raw green power"

Switching to Electric Vehicles (EVs) for Company Cars

In Japan, we are aiming to switch to 100% EVs by FY 2030. For this, we have developed detailed plans that take

into account the expiration of existing car lease contracts and the surrounding EV charging environment.

Introduction of a GHG Emissions Management Platform on a Group and Global Basis

We have implemented a GHG emissions management platform at approximately 2,400 of our consolidated

subsidiaries in more than 50 countries and regions around the world. This will enable automated aggregation of

GHG emissions and streamline business flows, as well as further refine data and enhance data analysis.

Roadmap for Achieving Carbon Neutrality - Transition Plan for a Decarbonized
Society

To achieve carbon neutrality, we are working to achieve net zero GHG emissions in our financed portfolio,
decarbonization through finance, and net zero emission from MUFG. We are working to achieve the targets set

for 2030, 2040, and 2050.

Climate Change-Related Opportunities

As a  financial institution, MUFG recognizes that supporting climate change measures and the transition to a

decarbonized society will lead to increased business opportunities.

MUFG announced a target of providing a cumulative 35 trillion yen in sustainable f inance by 2030.

We intend to commit 18 trillion yen of  finance in the environmental f ield, including initiatives to counter climate

change that will lead to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the conservation of the global

environment. We promote renewable energy through project  finance, etc., issue MUFG Green Bonds, which

ensure that the net proceeds are allocated to the Eligible Green Projects, provide commodities and services

aimed at mitigating environmental loads, encourage the climate change countermeasure consulting business and

so on. By doing so, we support the transition to a decarbonized society.

Expansion of Climate Change-Related Capital Investments and Financing
Opportunities for Financial Institutions

Demand for Capital Investment is Expected to Rise as a Result of the Acceleration of Net
Zero Initiatives in Various Industries

(note)

According to the IEA
, global decarbonization-related investment is expected to reach approximately USD 4
84
trillion annually from 2026 to 2030. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) estimates that domestic
investment in the energy, automobile, construction, and other sectors related to decarbonization will reach

approximately 17 trillion yen in 2030 alone, and approximately 150 trillion yen over a 10-year period.

In addition to Green Bonds and Green Loans issued to support capital investment plans, providing financing

support towards industrial innovations necessary for energy transition is also a major business opportunity for

financial institutions.

With its ESG strategy as a pillar of its management strategy, Japan Airlines aims to contribute to the realization of a
Status of Implementation
sustainable society by addressing social issues through its business.
MUFG has been in continuous discussion with Japan Airlines and supported its bond issuance by developing a
framework in accordance with the Green Bond Principles of the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) and
by providing support for obtaining a second party opinion in order to promote the company's ESG strategy through its
fund raising.
The purpose of the bond issuance is to diversify financing methods as the world’s first transition bond in the aviation
industry and to accelerate efforts toward net zero emissions by 2050 by allocating funds to investments, such as
cutting-edge, fuel-efficient aircraft, which contributes to CO  emission reduction.
Going forward, MUFG will continue to help enhance Japan Airline’s commitment to ESG management by supporting
the issuance of bonds and continue working with the company to support its ongoing efforts and new challenges
toward the transition to a decarbonized society.

Power Sector

MUFG coordinates dialogues between customers in the power sector and overseas institutional investors. As a
financial institution, we encourage customers and investors to close the gap in their perceptions of their position,
particularly the ideals and the reality of becoming carbon neutral. Most recently, we exchanged views on respective
approaches to transitioning and contributed to building a foundation for formulating strategies.

MUFG, including top management, regularly exchanges opinions with customers in the power sector regarding the
external environment and awareness of problems, and we are working to gain a more multifaceted understanding of
the position of customers through tours of power generation plants. To achieve the common goal of carbon neutrality
for both customers and MUFG, we will discuss how MUFG can best contribute to the formulation and implementation
of customers’ strategies, including the possibility of strategic investments and contributing human capital.

 Oil & Gas Sector

MUFG supports its customers in the oil and gas sector by working as one solid group to formulate strategies to
implement transitions for each company, such as the introduction of hydrogen, ammonia, and biomass.
In addition, by participating in discussions with local governments and various councils, we will deepen our
understanding of business conditions in the sector and support the promotion of individual projects, such as initiatives
for decarbonization of industrial complexes.

MUFG uses a wide range of engagement activities with customers in the oil & gas sector to help them achieve
transitions, including exchanging opinions on the future of the industry as well as providing opportunities to discuss
developments in new areas, such as forest management. We are also focusing on ways to deepen mutual
understanding by providing suggestions gained from our participation in COP26 and information on the environment in
which financial institutions are operating.

MUFG not only provides project finance support for geothermal power projects to customers in the oil & gas sector, but
we also encourage customers to enter the renewable energy field by providing financial advisory services for equity
investments in these projects. We are also one of the lead managers for issuing green bonds, and MUFG Group
companies are working together to help customers make successful transitions.

Establishment of a Solar Fund (Ecology Trust)

The Trust Bank has been offering solar funds every year since FY 2018 as an investment product.

The project has been well received by investors, who say that now they have a new investment option for solar power generation that produces a stable

profit. The amount of the fund is 24.7 billion yen (cumulative since FY 2018), and the total amount of power generation is the electric energy usage of 18,000

households.

The Trust Bank has been actively investing in renewable energy with investment totaling 31 power plants, 318 MW, and 132.8 billion yen (excluding already

established funds). The Trust Bank is also contributing to regional revitalization, by focusing on projects closely related to local businesses, governments, and

residents.

Introduction of Renewable Energy Power from Off-site Solar Power Generation Facility

The Bank has signed an agreement with NTT Anode Energy Corporation for an off-site PPA service
Through this service, the Bank has introduced electricity derived from renewable energy generated by the new solar power plant to 40 locations in eastern

 that utilizes a new power generation facility.

renewable energy sources over the long term, and directly contribute to the increase in the number of expandable renewable power sources

(note2)

(note1)

PPA, or Power Purchase Agreement,. is a service in which the power producers and electricity consumers execute a purchase agreement for renewable electricity at a

price and period agreed in advance, and renewable electricity generated from renewable power sources installed off-site, not in demand areas, is supplied to consumers
via ordinary power grids.

Launch of Solar Roof-top Lending Program

Krungsri (Bank of Ayudhya) launched the Solar Roof-top lending program for Retail and SME customers.  This program will finance customers in installing

solar panels on the roof-tops of their private and commercial residence, which will lead to energy savings and building of a clean energy community.

Participation in the "Fast-Growing Tree for Biomass Power Generation" Verification Project

The Trust Bank has started a verification project with Maniwa City in Okayama Prefecture and the Maniwa Forest Association to diversify the route to secure

stable fuel for biomass power generation by planting fast-growing trees on unused land such as abandoned farmland.
“Fast-Growing Tree for Biomass Power Generation” is a project that aims to make forests, an important asset that absorbs CO , a sustainable resource for
Japan, aiming to become carbon neutral by 2050, and to revitalize forestry and other forest businesses.
Together with the Maniwa Forest Association and Maniwa City, which has been selected as a leading area for decarbonization, we will promote a verification

project using willows, a fast-growing tree that grows naturally in Maniwa City, with the aim of further expanding the use of biomass power generation, to

contribute to the securing of raw materials for wood chips, a fuel source.

Provision of the World's First Limited-Recourse Financing for France's First Floating Offshore Wind Project

In November 2021, MUFG took part in the financing for the first floating offshore windfarm constructed in France.

Floating offshore wind is considered a key pillar in the energy transition regime under the Paris Agreement. In this project, the Tension-leg platform (TLP)

(note)

technology is utilized for its floaters, which is the first in the world. The pilot project will enable the confirmation of industrial principles and the improvement of

scientific, technical and environmental knowledge.

MUFG acted as Mandated Lead Arranger and Hedge Provider on the deal, and the total investment amounted to EUR 300m. This landmark transaction also

represents the first floating offshore wind farm to have successfully closed a limited-recourse financing worldwide.

MUFG has a strong desire to build on the expertise to support clients globally and particularly in France, Norway, Japan, South Korea and the US, which have

been identified as key markets where floating wind is expected to be deployed.

Climate Change Risks -Transition Risks and Physical Risks-

There are two kinds of climate change-related risk. First, there are risks arising in the course of the transition to a decarbonized society, such as stricter regulation and

the introduction of decarbonizing technologies (transition risks), and second, there are risks arising from physical damage due to the growing occurrences of climate

change-induced natural disasters and abnormal weather (physical risks).

Financial institutions are required to address both risks, which may directly impact their own business activities and indirectly affected due to impacts on clients.

Based on the suggestions of the TCFD, MUFG has summarized the examples of physical and transition risks for each of the major risk categories. The timelines

(short, medium, and long term) are also organized by risk category.

In addition, to prepare for the risk of damage to our employees and assets due to an increase in natural disasters and extreme weather events, we conduct various

drills and formulate a business continuity plan (BCP) to ensure business continuity.

Investments that take into account ESG factors are expected to support companies and various organizations

working to achieve a sustainable society and improve their long-term returns; thus, there is a growing interest in it, especially among institutional investors,

such as public pension funds.

MUFG's treasury business diversi fies the investment target to government bonds, foreign bonds, stocks, and corporate bonds, as well as green bonds and

other types of investments. In order to strengthen MUFG's  financial earnings and contribute to sustainable economic growth through ESG investments,

MUFG is going to promote ESG investments by f inding the right balance between risks and returns.

Climate Change Risks -Transition Risks and Physical Risks-

There are two kinds of climate change-related risk. First, there are risks arising in the course of the transition to a decarbonized society, such as stricter regulation and

the introduction of decarbonizing technologies (transition risks), and second, there are risks arising from physical damage due to the growing occurrences of climate

change-induced natural disasters and abnormal weather (physical risks).

Financial institutions are required to address both risks, which may directly impact their own business activities and indirectly affected due to impacts on clients.

Based on the suggestions of the TCFD, MUFG has summarized the examples of physical and transition risks for each of the major risk categories. The timelines

Examples of transition risks

(short, medium, and long term) are also organized by risk category.

In addition, to prepare for the risk of damage to our employees and assets due to an increase in natural disasters and extreme weather events, we conduct various

drills and formulate a business continuity plan (BCP) to ensure business continuity.

Examples of Impacts of Transition Risks and Physical Risks

MUFG has organized examples of impacts (examples of potential risks) of climate change on each of the major

risk categories of the physical and transition risks.
Risks are classi fied mainly around the following six categories. In the future, the classi fication of the risks and

examples will be reviewed in response to changes in the environment.

Climate Change-Related Risk in Enterprise Risk Management -Top Risk
Management-

In the "Top Risk Management" approach that MUFG primarily adopts for enterprise risk management, we

consider the risks arising from climate change as one of the Top Risks.

We also recognize that climate change-related risks are likely to become apparent and worsen in the medium to

long term.

In MUFG and its core subsidiaries, management is regularly engaged in discussions regarding the Top Risks to

gain a further understanding of the risk recognition, and to develop appropriate risk control countermeasures.

Top Risk Management

MUFG de fines a risk event as a loss that could be brought on to the Group as a result of the materialization of
various risk scenarios and determines the importance level based on the impact and probability of the event. Risk
events that should be paid most attention to over the next year are identif ied as Top risks.

Construction of a Management Framework to Address Change on a Group and

Global Basis

MUFG has established a project team on a group and global basis to strengthen the response to risks related to

climate change. The team will implement appropriate measures by identifying and sharing information on

regulatory trends etc. and by establishing a framework for risk management on a group and global basis.

To consider a management framework for risks related to climate change, a project team is established with

the Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO) as the lead and with participation of the CROs from the Bank, Trust Bank

and Securities, as well as regional CROs.

Main Items to be Considered and Provided a Response

● Establishment of a framework for customer transition support as a method of classifying and analyzing

risks related to climate change, clarifying risk appetite, and reflecting risk in the credit process.

● Organization of risk recognition related to transition risks and physical risks through case studies

Policies on the Sectors Related to the Environment, Including Climate Change

Since its establishment in May 2018, the MUFG Environmental and Social Policy Framework has been
periodically reviewed in response to changes in business activities and the business environment.
The most recent revision, made in April 2022, strengthened and revised policies for the climate-related sectors
(palm oil, mining (coal), and oil and gas sectors).

Example of Climate Change Risk Assessment

In the environmental and social risk assessment prior to the loan decision, the Bank evaluates the project proponent’s countermeasures on climate change and
confirms that they meet the requirements for climate change risk assessment in accordance with the Equator Principles. The followings are examples of physical and
transition risk assessments of individual projects in which banks conducted environmental and social risk assessments.

Physical Risk (offshore wind project)

The project was evaluated using the climate change prediction scenarios

published by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

Change (IPCC). Strong winds caused by typhoons and flooding caused

by rising sea levels were identified as the main physical risks, and it was

confirmed that the design of the facilities has been implemented to deal

with these risks.

Transition Risk (Gas and Diesel Combined Thermal Power
Generation Project)

The project aims to replace an aged power plant with a state-of-the-art

thermal power plant in order to support electricity demand on remote

islands. Policy and regulatory risks were identified as the primary

transition risks, and it was confirmed that the project will be consistent

with the country’s carbon neutrality goals and contributes to its energy

Responses to Climate Change Measures as an Asset Manager

Responses to TCFD as an Asset Manager

Asset management companies under the MUFG umbrella are endorsing TCFD as asset managers and working
to analyze the status of the investees' response to climate change and assess their impact through the

management of the portfolios they manage under contract.
The Trust Bank disclosed information about the management of the portfolios it manages in line with the TCFD's

recommendations for disclosure under Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets
regarding climate-related risks and opportunities. By proactively disclosing climate change-related information,

we will help our clients understand the status of their portfolios and encourage the companies in which we invest
to take action on climate change.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions-Related Indicators for the Portfolio

MUFG calculates and evaluates greenhouse gas emission-related indicators (total greenhouse gas emissions,
carbon footprint, and weighted average carbon emission factors) for measuring and managing climate change
related risks and opportunities in our portfolios of equities and bonds.
Indicators related to greenhouse gas emission are calculated using a data collection and analysis method via
Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). The analysis of total annual GHG emissions (Scope1 and Scope2) for
all investees, including MUFG AM
will be 22.4 million t-CO e (as of March 31, 2022).

As a result of the analysis, MUFG has projected the transition of total greenhouse gas emissions for a single

portfolio of assets, and the companies in our portfolio currently account for approximately 60% of allowable

greenhouse gas emissions and are expected to exceed the SDS by 2038. MUFG believes that, based on the

results of its analysis, it is important to encourage portfolio companies to limit the risk of transition in the medium

in turn will damage the value of our clients’ portfolios. On the other hand, we believe that the impact of climate

change can serve as a major business opportunity if investee companies respond proactively. As an asset

management company, we strive to improve our investment capabilities in light of the risks and opportunities that

climate change brings to our portfolio. Meanwhile, we believe that we can contribute to the resolution of climate

Initiatives for Responding to Climate Change as an Asset Management Company

MUFG recognizes the risk that climate change will cause a significant impact on society and the economy, which

in turn will damage the value of our clients’ portfolios. On the other hand, we believe that the impact of climate

change can serve as a major business opportunity if investee companies respond proactively. As an asset

climate change brings to our portfolio. Meanwhile, we believe that we can contribute to the resolution of climate

change issues by encouraging appropriate responses through discussions with investee companies and
collaboration with other stakeholders.

Positioning Climate Change as a Material ESG Issue

In a materiality matrix, ESG issues on asset management are mapped from the perspective of materiality in

terms of society and MUFG Asset Management. In this context, climate change has been positioned as one of

the most significant issues. (We are the first Japanese asset management company to adopt a materiality matrix)
117
Addressing climate change is essential for improving investment value. We will contribute to the smooth transition
to a decarbonized society through engagement, etc. with our investees.

MUFG-AM is addressing climate change issues with a focus on the following four areas:

Engagement/Exercise of Voting Rights

It must be said that funding and recovery from investment alone will only have limited effect on GHG reduction in

the real world. Through engagement (purposeful discussion with investees) and the exercise of voting rights,

MUFG encourages individual investee companies to reduce their GHG emissions. We believe that this will lead

to a smooth resolution of climate change issues and to a sustainable increase in investment value. MUFG

engages in ESG issues from a perspective of sustainable value enhancement of investment.

We also participate in Climate Action 100+ (CA100+), a global investor initiative. CA100+ interacts with

approximately 160 companies that emit large amounts of GHG to promote efforts to reduce emissions. As one of

the lead investors, we lead engagement with target Japanese companies.

Managing Financial Products as a Response to Climate Change

In principle, MUFG-AM has been devising ways to incorporate ESG perspectives into their investment process

for all assets under management related to entrusted assets. With regard to the investment products that focus

on addressing climate change issues, we provide investment products such as low-carbon index-linked passive

management and active management that focus on sustainable energy to meet the needs of our customers.

Collaboration with Initiatives

The Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative is a global initiative led by asset managers committed to solving

climate change issues. NZAM aims to achieve net-zero GHG emissions from its investees by 2050, in order to
achieve the goal agreed in the Paris Agreement (to keep the global average temperature rise below 2℃,
compared to pre-Industrial Revolution and to keep it at 1.5℃). MUFG AM has been an active member since

MUFG Bank supports its clients' environmental and social risk management and contributes toward a sustainable
world by adoption of and adherence to the Equator Principles, a risk management framework for determining,

assessing and managing environmental and social risks and impacts for large-scale projects.

Environmental and social impact assessment and risk
management through the Equator Principles

MUFG Bank (the Bank) recognizes that large-scale infrastructure and natural resources development projects
may have adverse impacts on local environment and surrounding communities. 
The Bank, as a financier and/or a financial advisor, works in partnership with its clients to determine, assess and
manage environmental and social risks and impacts related to the projects. 
The Bank adopted the Equator Principles in 2005 to ensure that the projects it finances and advises on are
developed in a socially responsible manner and establish good environmental management practices to
minimize, mitigate, and/or offset environmental and social risks and impacts. 
The Bank supports its clients' environmental and social risk management and contributes toward a sustainable
world through implementation of the Equator Principles, a risk management framework for determining,
assessing and managing environmental and social risks and impacts for large-scale projects.

About the Equator Principles

The Equator Principles is a financial industry benchmark for determining, assessing and managing

environmental and social risk and impacts in projects, which is intended to serve as a common baseline

and framework for all the financial institutions adopting the Equator Principles (EPFIs). EPFIs ensure

that the projects they finance and advise on are developed in a manner that is socially responsible and

reflects sound environmental management practices. 

There are 134 EPFIs globally as of June 30th, 2022.

The most recent (fourth ) version of Equator Principle was adopted officially in November 2019, and the

Bank will start applying the fourth version of the Equator Principles to transactions which are mandated

on or after July 1, 2020. The scope includes Project Finance, Project Finance Advisory Services,

Project-related Corporate Loans, Bridge Loans, Project-Related Refinance and Project-Related

Acquisition Finance. 

EPFIs commit to implementing the Equator Principles in their internal environmental and social policies,
procedures, and standards for financing projects. EPFIs will not provide loans to projects where the

Environment
For Designated Countries, the assessment process evaluates compliance with relevant host country laws,

Social

Governance

regulations, and permits that pertain to environmental and social issues. In addition to the host country laws, EPFIs
may evaluate the specific risks of the project to determine whether one or more of the IFC Performance Standards

on Environmental and Social Sustainability (Performance Standards) could be used as guidance to address those

risks.

For Non-Designated Countries, besides evaluation of compliance with relevant host country laws, regulations, and

permits that pertain to environmental and social issues, the assessment process evaluates compliance with the then

applicable IFC Performance Standards and the World Bank Group Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines

(EHS Guidelines).

(*3) 

Principle 5 of the Equator Principles requires projects with the special circumstances defined in IFC Performance

Standard 7 paragraphs 13-17 to engage a qualified independent consultant to evaluate the consultation process with

Indigenous Peoples, and the outcomes of that process, against the requirements of host country laws and IFC

Performance Standard 7. 

Special circumstances defined in the IFC Performance Standard are; 

Projects with impacts on lands and natural resources subject to traditional ownership or under the customary use

of Indigenous Peoples,

Projects requiring the relocation of Indigenous Peoples from lands and natural resources subject to traditional

ownership or under customary use,

Projects with significant impacts on critical cultural heritage essential to the identity of Indigenous Peoples, or

Projects using their cultural heritage for commercial purposes.

Natural capital is a stock, composed of animals, plants, water, soil, and air, which provides various merits,
including water, food, and minerals to businesses and society through ecosystem services such as water
purification as well as climate control.
Biodiversity is the diversity of animals and plants that are part of natural capital, functioning to maintain the
natural capital in a healthy and stable state through recovery from natural disasters such as floods and droughts,
support for the carbon cycle, the water cycle and soil formation.

Main Initiatives

MUFG Environmental Policy Statement, MUFG Environmental and Social Policy
Framework

In MUFG Environmental Policy Statement and the MUFG Environmental and Social Policy Framework, MUFG
has established the following policies:

MUFG Environmental Policy Statement

(extract) [Maintenance and protection of the biodiversity which supports our society is the foundation for the

realization of a sustainable society. MUFG supports businesses that protect biodiversity through the provision of

products and services. Each group company also takes appropriate measures to prevent negative impacts on

biodiversity associated with our products and services.]

MUFG Environmental and Social Policy Framework

In light of the nature and severity of environmental and social risks or impacts, businesses that have a negative

impact on Ramsar-designated wetlands, businesses that have a negative impact on UNESCO World Heritage

sites, and businesses that violate the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild fauna

and Flora (Washington Convention) are defined as "Prohibited Transactions", In addition, as "Transactions of

High Caution", we have identified businesses that have a negative impact on areas with high conservation value

and sectors such as mining (coal), oil and gas, large-scale hydroelectric power generation, forestry, and palm oil.

When considering financing, we check the implementation status of environmental and social considerations by

our customers, including their impact on the ecosystem and how they are responding.

Initiatives

Endorsement of Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum

The TNFD is an international initiative launched in June 2021 by the United Nations Environment Programme

Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Wide Fund for

Nature (WWF) and Global Canopy. TNFD aims to shift global financial flows toward nature-positive outcomes

through disclosure of nature-related information by companies. The TNFD Forum is a stakeholder organization to

provides information and technical support related to TNFD.

In February 2022, MUFG joined the TNFD Forum to promote initiatives for natural capital and biodiversity across

the Group. We also participated in a meeting of the TNFD Consultation Group of Japan established in June 2022.

In addition, referring to the LEAP approach

 presented in the framework beta version, we have started to

(note)

analyze natural capital risks together with Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, a member of the forum. As a

member of the forum, we will continue to actively participate in discussions to further contribute to the realization

of a sustainable environment and society.

(note)

LEAP approach: An approach proposed as a practical risk assessment method for natural capital and consists of four

steps: Locate the contact point between the company and nature, Evaluate the impact and dependence on nature,

Assess the risks and opportunities related to nature, and Prepare business strategies and disclosures according to

those risks and opportunities.

MUFG supports the purpose of the Alliance and has been participating in it

since its launch.

Declaration of Biodiversity by Keidanren

MUFG endorses the Declaration of Biodiversity by Keidanren and Action
Policy, as revised in October 2018. The Declaration of Biodiversity by
Keidanren and Action Policy aim to realize a sustainable society through
the creation of a society in harmony with nature. We are calling for the
integration of business activities and environmental measures, which
encompass a wide range of environmental activities, such as biodiversity
conservation. MUFG will promote initiatives based on this concept.

Activities for Protecting Natural Capital and Biodiversity

MUFG Pledges Support to Promote Cyclic Utilization of Forests

In recent years, the abandonment of artificial forests planted for timber production has become a serious social
issue. There is a growing need to promote the cyclic utilization of forest resources, in which trees are planted,
grown, harvested, used and planted again. MUFG has so far undertaken a number of tree-planting projects

aimed at preserving and passing on the rich blessings of forests to the next generation. Our support for this

research institute engaged in promoting cyclic utilization of forest resources is motivated by the same aim.

(note)

A specified nonprofit organization that started as a volunteer organization in 2003. The Institute mainly works on forest

creation and conservation, promoting the utilization of wood by companies (providing environmental and social

contribution programs for employee participation), and field experience activities for mothers and children.

Peter Rabbit™ Forest for the Future

In March 2022, the Trust Bank entered a forest development agreement
with Fujikawaguchiko Town (Yamanashi Prefecture), Kodachi Property

District Management Association, and Fuji-Hokuroku Forest Association,
and named a 1.67 ha mountain forest in Kodachi (Fujikawaguchiko Town,

Minamitsuru County, Yamanashi Prefecture) "Peter Rabbit™ Forest for the
Future,” starting a new initiative for biodiversity conservation through forest

and water resource conservation.
In May 2009, we entered a similar agreement for forest conservation in

Nagatoro Town, Saitama Prefecture. Now, we are engaged in work to
cultivate new forests.

Forests play a variety of roles, including conservation of land, conservation
of ecosystems, and prevention of global warming. In particular, forests in

water source areas play an important role in the stable supply of safe and
high-quality water by performing so-called water source rearing functions

such as storing water resources and purifying water quality.
We believe that it is important for all officers and employees to continue to
care for forests and maintain healthy forests.

ACOM no Mori (ACOM's Forest)

ACOM conducts forest conservation activities in Kanagawa and Osaka
prefectures, where the company’s contact centers are located, in order to
contribute to environmental conservation and to foster an awareness of
employee participation in social contribution and an interest in the
environment.

Mangrove Reforestation Activity

Mangrove forests are priceless resources of marine and coastal ecosystems, and indispensable for the

economic, social, and environmental sustainability.  Planting mangrove trees will not only help build natural

barriers against soil erosion, but also create nature study areas with great biodiversity worth conserving.

Krungsri has been organized in collaboration with government agencies and provincial administrative authorities
to continuously promote this reforestation activity since 2012.  Bank Danamon has been actively engaged in

mangrove reforestation activities as well, planting seeds in collaboration with local companies and authorities of

Indonesia.

Located in Nishitokyo City, Tokyo, MUFG Park is a facility with abundant

nature, sports facilities including tennis courts, and a community library

(scheduled to open in 2023).

With a total area of approximately six hectares, MUFG Park also

contributes to the preservation and succession of important natural value

in an urban area.

Eco-friendly Mitsubishi UFJ Card

Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS issues environmentally friendly Mitsubishi UFJ Cards (with some exceptions) from signing

up to issuing cards, bill statements, and point rewards. In addition to the use of PET-G materials for credit cards

which do not emit chlorine when incinerated and application forms made of forest conservation paper, we offer a

donation program, as a part of point reward program, to environmental conservation organizations engaged in

forest maintenance and reforestation projects in Japan.

Environmental Accounting Information for Our Offices

MUFG announces the results of environmental accounting from FY 2009, as part of environmentally conscious
business activities, for the quantitative management of environmental efforts.

Net Zero GHG from Own Operations

MUFG aims to achieve net-zero GHG emissions

(note1)

 in its own operations by 2030. In addition to our initiatives

to reduce energy use through continued energy conservation, we will reduce our gasoline consumption by

switching to electric vehicles (EVs) and promote the use of renewable energy sources for electricity to become

net zero for GHG emissions by 2030. We will also work to establish and introduce raw green power

(note2)

 to

directly contribute to an increase in renewable energy sources.

Overseas, while accumulating expertise from promoting domestic environmental initiatives and introducing

renewable energy at our European business locations, we will accelerate implementing specific measures, taking

into account the status of policies and systems to promote decarbonization in each country.

(note1)

Scope1 and Scope2 in the GHG protocol.

(note2)

Green power, generated from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and biomass (biological resources), is sent
directly from the power plant to the consumer. Customers can use green power directly as electricity for their own use,

rather than "deemed" to do so.

We also strive to protect the privacy of all customers involved in our business activities, including banking, by
ensuring appropriate handling of their personal information and prevention of data leaks.

The MUFG Environmental and Social Policy Framework was established as the basis for ceasing, preventing,

and mitigating adverse environmental and social impacts, including human rights issues, in financing for
corporate customers. We assure respect for human rights by conducting due diligence as prescribed in the Policy

Framework when necessary in making credit decisions at the Bank and the Trust Bank, and in underwriting
bonds and equities at the Securities. This Policy Framework prohibits financing for businesses that engage in
child or forced labor.

We recognize that large-scale infrastructure and natural resources development projects may have adverse
impacts on the local environment and surrounding communities. In accordance with the Equator Principles, the
Bank identifies risks and impacts on society and the environment, including the status of consideration for human
rights, in the operations of recipients of financing and confirms mitigation measures suggested by customers.

In addition, MUFG Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking, MUFG Securities EMEA, etc. have announced
efforts to reduce the risk of human trafficking and other measures in their statement on the Modern Slavery Act.

On Suppliers

MUFG has stipulated its Approach to Purchasing Activity which requires suppliers to respect basic human rights.

Based on the Approach to Purchasing Activity, the Bank provides and explains its Guidelines for Purchasing

Activity to its suppliers and asks them to understand MUFG's policy. The Bank has also established procedures

for external contractors to periodically evaluate matters related to human rights, depending on the importance of

the contract and the circumstances of the contract, and takes appropriate measures. The Bank has also

established a consultation service for suppliers to prevent the abuse of superior bargaining positions and human

rights violations against suppliers, which is described in the Guidelines for Purchasing Activity.

Approach to Purchasing Activity: Policies and Guidlines 

Furthermore, in response to the enforcement of the Modern Slavery Act in the UK in 2015 and in Australia in
2019, MUFG companies subject to this law published statements of their initiatives to prevent the exploitation of
labor and human trafficking in their and suppliers' business in fiscal 2019, and are working to prevent human
rights abuses in their supply chains.

We also strive to protect the privacy of all customers involved in our business activities, including banking, by

ensuring appropriate handling of their personal information and prevention of data leaks.

The MUFG Environmental and Social Policy Framework was established as the basis for ceasing, preventing,

and mitigating adverse environmental and social impacts, including human rights issues, in financing for

corporate customers. We assure respect for human rights by conducting due diligence as prescribed in the Policy

Framework when necessary in making credit decisions at the Bank and the Trust Bank, and in underwriting

bonds and equities at the Securities. This Policy Framework prohibits financing for businesses that engage in

child or forced labor.

We recognize that large-scale infrastructure and natural resources development projects may have adverse

impacts on the local environment and surrounding communities. In accordance with the Equator Principles, the

Bank identifies risks and impacts on society and the environment, including the status of consideration for human

rights, in the operations of recipients of financing and confirms mitigation measures suggested by customers.

In addition, MUFG Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking, MUFG Securities EMEA, etc. have announced

efforts to reduce the risk of human trafficking and other measures in their statement on the Modern Slavery Act.

The Equator Principles

On Suppliers

MUFG has stipulated its Approach to Purchasing Activity which requires suppliers to respect basic human rights.

Based on the Approach to Purchasing Activity, the Bank provides and explains its Guidelines for Purchasing

Activity to its suppliers and asks them to understand MUFG's policy. The Bank has also established procedures

for external contractors to periodically evaluate matters related to human rights, depending on the importance of

the contract and the circumstances of the contract, and takes appropriate measures. The Bank has also

established a consultation service for suppliers to prevent the abuse of superior bargaining positions and human

rights violations against suppliers, which is described in the Guidelines for Purchasing Activity.

Approach to Purchasing Activity: Policies and Guidlines 

Furthermore, in response to the enforcement of the Modern Slavery Act in the UK in 2015 and in Australia in

2019, MUFG companies subject to this law published statements of their initiatives to prevent the exploitation of
labor and human trafficking in their and suppliers' business in fiscal 2019, and are working to prevent human

rights abuses in their supply chains.

A consultation service for issues such as sexual harassment and abuse of authority is established at each Group
company to ensure a pleasant and positive work environment and promote human rights. It responds to reports

submitted in-person or via phone, email, etc., while providing consideration for the individual's anonymity and
privacy. It also accepts and responds to reports from stakeholders outside the Group, including customers and

suppliers, about human rights violations caused by MUFG's business activities. 

In cases where executives or employees of a Group company, or financial products or services provided by them,

are confirmed as performing or being involved in activities which adversely affect human rights, MUFG will
respond in an appropriate manner and implement remedial actions.

Grievance Mechanism

The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights require companies to establish a
grievance mechanism, and MUFG has established a system to appropriately respond to the opinions and
complaints of customers and other stakeholders, including those on human rights issues.
When it becomes clear that an officer or employee of a Group company or a product or service provided by a
Group company causes, contributes to, or is directly linked to adverse impacts on human rights, MUFG will
respond appropriately and work to provide remedy to the situation.

Since the social and competitive environment is changing drastically, we aim to develop human resources

capable of responding to such changes. While enriching opportunities for challenge and learning, each and every
one of us will autonomously build our careers so that we can acquire opportunities to play an active role on our

own.

Encouraging the Pursuit of Personal Growth and Challenging Endeavors

(cid:72)

The MUFG Human Resources Principles provide the basis on which the Group has built a human resources
management platform that aligns with the MUFG Way.

Shared Values

HR Mission

HR VisionTeamwork

HR Philosophy

Policies and Guidelines

Our basic philosophy on human resource development is to provide each employee with educational
opportunities that enhance their discernment and sense of ethics as well as their knowledge and expertise, and
to develop human resources who can make the MUFG Way a reality.
In line with the MUFG Way, we aim to provide our employees with opportunities for personal growth and offer an
environment in which they can direct their energies into working with a sense of ful fillment. To this end, we

promote inclusion & diversity. To embody the MUFG Way, we have also positioned "Integrity and Responsibility",

"Professionalism and Teamwork" and "Challenge Ourselves to Grow" as values to be shared by all employees as

def ined by the MUFG Human Resources Principles, which serve as the basis for human resources management.

Based on these principles, all Group companies engage in the planning and implementation of their respective

human resources management policies.

Improve Productivity and Nurture Professionals

During the period leading up to the end of FY2023,we expect a reduction in the individual workload dueto such
factors as increased use of digital technologiesto be accompanied by natural attrition in our employeeheadcount.
Accordingly, we deem it important toredirect our human resources toward high-value-addedoperations and
empower them to achievehigher performance as professionals. To this end, weaim to enhance operational ef -

ficiency and improveproductivity via the incorporation of "smart" work stylesand the digital shift.

Today, our employees are being called on to enhancetheir knowledge and skills in their respective business f -

ields. With this in mind, we will promote humanresource development and exchange on a groupwidebasis while
stepping up the specialty-focusedrecruitment of new graduates and individuals withexternal experience. In

particular, we anticipate agrowing need for specialists in compliance, internalauditing, legal affairs and other

governance-relatedfields that require a high level of expertise as well asspecialists in digital and cybersecurity

field. We alsoneed to secure human resources well-versed in wealthmanagement, large corporate business

requiring sectorspecialists and other fields in which MUFG aims toexpand its operations. With this in mind, we

will enhancehuman resources systems supporting our strategiesin these fields while taking a groupwide,

integratedapproach to realize  flexible staffing.

In the face of a constantly shrinking total headcountdue largely to natural attrition, we will also develop

aperformance-based employee evaluation system thatempowers diverse human resources to achieve

greatercareer success than before regardless of their gender orage and thus accelerate the appointment of

employeesbased on the performance.

Inclusion & Diversity

Integrated Management of Human Resources around the Globe

Currently, the MUFG Group has approximately 75,000 employees

 hired in countries other than Japan. In an

(note)

effort to ensure that all of them feel comfortable about being part of the MUFG workforce, we develop employee

trainings aimed at facilitating their understanding of MUFG culture. We have also introduced on-the-job (OJT)

training programs in which overseas employees take on assignments in countries outside of their location of

employment, such as in Japan.

In addition, we hold cross-regional and cross-functional committees under a global talent management

framework to conduct talent reviews and succession planning.

Thanks to these ongoing efforts, greater numbers of those who were hired in countries abroad are taking on

managerial positions at MUFG. For example, the Bank's executive officers include 10 people hired in countries

Programs Designed to Encourage Those Who Take on Challenges

MUFG has developed an extensive lineup of programs designed

to empower employees to pursue personal growth and take on

challenges as well as to support their autonomous efforts to

develop their career paths. Among these programs is Job

Challenge, an in-house job-posting program. In FY2021, the

number of applicants to this program more than tripled from the

previous year and included 164 employees who signed up for a

dual in-house assignment system launched in said fiscal year

(see below). Additionally, in FY2022, the scope of an external

dual-job arrangement at the Bank have expanded and made it

possible for employees to act as private business owners outside the Group.

Nurturing Future Top Management: MUFG University

One of the key management issues of MUFG is the development of the future top management who will lead
innovation and responsible for taking on challenges and creating value. As a solution to this issue, the Group

launched the MUFG University program for line managers and above in FY2018, with a total of more than 600

attendees to date (196 in FY2018, 220 in  FY2019, 192 in FY2020, 171 in FY2021).

MUFG University offers two different courses, namely, the "Next-Generation Leader Course", which aims to

secure the future leaders of MUFG, and the "Management Course", which aims to help managers enhance their

skills.

In the Next-Generation Leader Course, we offer general managers and branch managers multi-layered training

programs through interactive classes conducted by external corporate managers and academic experts. The

Management Course is designed for Managing Directors, deputy general managers and deputy branch

managers and offers a liberal arts session to cultivate the human skills and wide perspective required for

management, thus steadily securing a robust pool of top management candidates. In FY2019, we launched a

project to develop coaching skills at the domestic general managers and branch managers. A total of 50 people
participated in the program by FY2020. In management, we draw out the individuality and strengths of each

Nurturing Global Human Resources

Today, the MUFG Group has expanded into more than 50 countries around the globe, and approximately 58% of
its entire workforce is accounted for by overseas employees (as of May 31,2022). Based on the concept of
"inclusion & diversity", which is one of MUFG's priority issues, in order to recruit and develop a diverse range of
professionals, it is necessary to foster our corporate brand both in Japan and overseas so that people will want to
work for MUFG.
MUFG is expanding opportunities for employees to play an even more active role by operating a market-standard
and globally unif ied human resources platform for title management, employee evaluation, wage determination
and other human resources practices.
Also, as more and more employees with diverse backgrounds join, we began implementing job-level based
training programs on a global basis to ensure all Group members understand the MUFG Way and embrace a
shared culture. For example, we provide the Global LEAD Program targeting those in managing director or

similar positions with a variety of experiences from different countries and regions where the group operates, to

help such individuals acquire essential leadership knowledge as well as necessary perspectives and in-depth

expertise on global operations. In addition, in the Three-month Intensive Program for working-level employees,

participants from overseas facilities will receive on-the-job training in the form of business trips to other regional

departments for three months. This not only fosters the development of the participating employees, but also

fosters the mindset of the employees at the host sites to work globally.

These efforts are helping to increase the motivation of employees hired overseas, while at the same time

expanding the talent pool, thereby promoting competition within the company and creating a virtuous cycle that

will lead to the realization of a stronger organization. Today, a growing number of individuals hired overseas have

been promoted to managerial posts.
For example, 10 of these individuals, including two women, have assumed executive officer positions at the Bank
(as of March 31, 2022).

Initiatives of Group Companies

Each Group company is developing training programs in order to ensure that employees can provide high-value-
148
added services to customers with a high-level of motivation and expertise.

MUFG Bank

The Bank defines a role model as an employee who has personal capacity, skills and expertise, and can deliver

achievements and contribution. In other words, an employee begins with personal capacity, adding skills and

expertise gained as a professional to attain high levels of achievement and contribution on a medium- to long-

term basis. In addition to cross-divisional, rank-specific training to develop personal capacity and division-specific

skills training to acquire "skills and expertise," we also have a rich menu of self-development support programs to

provide opportunities for autonomous learning according to each individual's stage of growth.

In order to improve day-to-day working experience, the Bank strives to cultivate an environment to foster human

resource development within the workplace. We are creating a "culture of nurturing people" and strengthening

the organization by developing the "1-on-1 Guidebook" and "Career Interview Guidebook," both of which are

designed to activate communication between supervisors and subordinates in terms of "quality and quantity," and

by expanding the mentoring system and guidance officer system for the development of young employees.

Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking

To cultivate true professionals who inspire confidence in customers, the Trust Bank provides training tailored to

each individual's position, rank and occupation. Through its Personnel Development Program in each field of

business, the company conducts practical job rotation and carries out training for the specific work

responsibilities of each division. In addition, the Trust Bank is expanding the range of educational opportunities

for employees seeking to independently develop their careers through the "MUTB Business School," self-

enrichment seminars, dispatch outside the company, support for obtaining qualifications and various other

educational support programs.

Initiatives of Group Companies

Each Group company is developing training programs in order to ensure that employees can provide high-value-
added services to customers with a high-level of motivation and expertise.

Governance

MUFG Bank

The Bank defines a role model as an employee who has personal capacity, skills and expertise, and can deliver

achievements and contribution. In other words, an employee begins with personal capacity, adding skills and
expertise gained as a professional to attain high levels of achievement and contribution on a medium- to long-

term basis. In addition to cross-divisional, rank-specific training to develop personal capacity and division-specific
skills training to acquire "skills and expertise," we also have a rich menu of self-development support programs to

provide opportunities for autonomous learning according to each individual's stage of growth.
In order to improve day-to-day working experience, the Bank strives to cultivate an environment to foster human

resource development within the workplace. We are creating a "culture of nurturing people" and strengthening
the organization by developing the "1-on-1 Guidebook" and "Career Interview Guidebook," both of which are

designed to activate communication between supervisors and subordinates in terms of "quality and quantity," and
by expanding the mentoring system and guidance officer system for the development of young employees.

Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking

To cultivate true professionals who inspire confidence in customers, the Trust Bank provides training tailored to
each individual's position, rank and occupation. Through its Personnel Development Program in each field of
business, the company conducts practical job rotation and carries out training for the specific work
responsibilities of each division. In addition, the Trust Bank is expanding the range of educational opportunities
for employees seeking to independently develop their careers through the "MUTB Business School," self-
enrichment seminars, dispatch outside the company, support for obtaining qualifications and various other
educational support programs.

Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities

In order to cultivate human resources that possess both "outstanding personal capacity" and a "high level of
professionalism" and contribute towards improving the capacity, qualities, passion and expertise of employees,
the Securities Business actively implements OJT, which encourages growth through work experience, and OFF-
JT, which entails implementing training according to rank and occupation, supporting employees in bettering
themselves professionally and so on. In the training according to rank, the Securities Business works to ensure
thorough adherence to the MUFG Way and the MUFG Group Code of Conduct and strengthen management
functions and engagement, while in the training according to occupation, we work to improve the skills and

expertise required from each business division in order to continue to provide customers with high-grade

services. Moreover, the Securities Business is also focusing its efforts on supporting independent career

development by enhancing support systems for self-betterment and acquisition of qualifications by all its

employees.

Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS

In order to develop human resources who can adopt and respond to social changes, such as the cashless

society, and continue to grow on their own, we implement job rotation system, OJT to promote growth through

work execution in the workplace, career development support, job-level based training, and self-development
support, based on the pillars of “emphasis on OJT" and “support for autonomous growth.”
Specifically, OJT officers are appointed with the goal of realizing joint learning and growth among young and mid-
career employees based on mutual teaching and learning while performing everyday tasks. In rank-specific
training, cross-departmental training is implemented to impart the necessary skills and foster the right mindset for

each rank. Meanwhile, in support for self-improvement, we actively provide opportunities for autonomous growth

through e-learning, external dispatches and so on geared to supporting the career development of each and

every employee. In particular, we are focusing on measures to improve digital literacy throughout the company.

ACOM

In order to develop employees who embody ACOM's corporate philosophy of "Customers First," "Creative and

Innovative Management," and "the Spirit of Human Dignity," ACOM is implementing various types of training,

including on-the-job training, rank-specific training, and selective training.

Additionally, ACOM is actively carrying out measures to support the independent career development of its

employees, such as offering e-learning and correspondence educational programs as well as providing support

for the acquisition of official certifications.

Krungsri (Bank of Ayudhya)

Krungsri understands that employees play a crucial role in the organization’s productivity and has striven for a

comprehensive human resource development with ‘People Excellence’ as its core value.  Four pillars, namely

“Adherence to and demonstration of Krungsri core values”, “Leadership development”, “Professionalism

improvement”, and “Good corporate citizenship” have been stipulated to support this value, and various

programs are provided for talent development.  There are programs provided jointly between MUFG and

Krungsri, such as the Global Leaders Forum, and many which is unique to Krungsri.

One such case is the extensive e-learning programs of Krungsri which provides training opportunities to all levels

to enhance their capabilities in tandem with the COVID-19 pandemic.  A total of 764 online programs were made

available in 2021, which were attended by 74,895 employees (representing 108 thousand training hours)

Bank Danamon

Bank Danamon regards competency development as one of the Bank’s investments in its employee, along with

the Bank’s strategies that focus on people, digital and branding.  As part of its support for human resources

development, Bank Danamon has consistently organized training programs to increase employee’s knowledge

and skills.  Various employee training opportunities are provided according to the training needs and objective,

Career Development Support Programs

Each group company has put in place systems that allow employees to change their particular occupation or

career track, as well as in-house job-posting systems that let employees apply for different jobs that they want to

try.

MUFG Bank

In order to support independent career development of each and every employee, the Bank has created an in-

house recruiting system that permits employees to apply for the position of their choice. They can apply for a

variety of posts at branches and offices in Japan and overseas as well as at the Head Office. Many employees

have responded when job openings are announced several times a year. The Bank has also added CSR

approaches as a company that respects the work-life balance. For example, by offering a system to allow

changes in career track between Main Career Track, and Business Specialist (BS) tracks; a Relocation Posting
System combined with consideration of circumstances such as job transfer of a spouse, or the need to care for a
family member; and a system that allows non-permanent staff including contract employees to become regular
employees.

A Global Job Posting Framework is also in place for overseas employees, recruiting for internal positions on a

global basis. This system enables employees including those employed in Japan to work at locations beyond the
country in which they were employed.

150

Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking

We have established the Career Challenge System, a program for realizing wishes and declarations related to

one's career, which is conducted twice a year. Under this system, we have established a Job Challenge System

that allows employees to experience their desired departments and tasks, a Post Challenge System that allows

employees to challenge themselves for managerial positions, and an Active Career Challenge System that allows

employees to choose their work style with outlook for their career until age 65. We have also introduced an in-

house side job system that does not involve transfers, which allow employees to challenge new tasks in different

business domains while staying at the current position. As part of our career development efforts, we will

continue to create a system that responds to the wishes and willingness of employees to take on challenges.

Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities

Responding to the desire for autonomous career development by a wide range of employees, from young

members to mid-career personnel, the Securities Business offers various opportunities, including the Job

Challenge program, which is an in-house recruitment system providing opportunities to engage in different

aspects of the business, the Group Subscription scheme, which allows employees to experience work they

aspire to in MUFG Bank or Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking, domestic and overseas study trips, and external

placements. In addition, the Securities Business provides opportunities for self-study as an additional means to

support employee career development. The Securities Business has also established a system that allows

employees to request a transfer to a different position that is necessitated by marriage or the transfer of a spouse

to a different location, in addition to a system that allows employees to request a switch to a career track different

from their current one due to reasons such as a change in their personal capabilities and level of suitability or in

their sets of values. In these ways, the Securities Business is providing continuous support for the career

development of its employees.

Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS

NICOS also offers broad opportunities for employees who have the desire to use their skills to the utmost, by

starting to offer the new Regional Main Career Track in FY 2014, which involves no job transfers. Their system to

allow changes in career track lets employees challenge themselves for career advancement by adding the

Regional Main Career Track to existing Regular Service and Main Career options.

In addition, we provide opportunities for our employees to expand the scope of their work through the open

recruitment system for challenges.

Going forward, NICOS will actively hire talented employees with a desire to change career tracks and strive to

put in place systems that emphasize work-life balance.

ACOM

ACOM provides diverse career opportunities to support employees' career enhancement. For example, fixed-

term employees are able to move up to full-time employees, and those who started their career with limited

promotion opportunities can change their work course to broaden their opportunities. ACOM also provides

periodical opportunities for employees to assess and submit their desired career development plans in order to

support their fulfillments.

Corporate Citizenship Project

Since FY 2007, MUFG Bank has included volunteer work in the training programs for new employees. By having
them participate in volunteer activities in the local community, this program aims to help employees become
aware of their roles as members of society. This experience also allows new employees to adopt the basic
attitude of serving society and proactively offering what they can to people and society in general.

151

Under this hands-on training program, called the Corporate Citizenship Project in cooperation with the Tokyo

Voluntary Action Center and other local volunteer centers, new employees visit more than 100 welfare facilities

for two days in the Tokyo metropolitan area and Yokohama annually until FY2019. Since FY2020, we have

switched to an online format and implemented a two-day program from the perspective of preventing the spread

of COVID-19 in both welfare facilities and new employees. In addition to their online-based welfare activities,

through pre-visit orientations, volunteering opportunities, and post-activity reviews, some new hires concluded

that the program was an excellent opportunity to reconsider what they can do as members of society. Others

have mentioned that the volunteering experience aided them in understanding the importance of considering

circumstances from someone else's point of view. Just as importantly, the program allows newly-hired employees

to recognize their significance as members of society.

Evaluation of Human Resources

Our Approach to Evaluation of Human Resources

In order to achieve MUFG's vision of the future, each employee is required to make changes and there is a need

to create an environment that encourages employees to grow and take on challenges. Based on this, MUFG is

reviewing the ideal employee pro file and qualif ication requirements with a greater emphasis on "professionalism"

and "innovation and challenge" and are also developing an environment that encourages employees to

voluntarily make innovation and strive to achieve the careers they seek.

As for the performance evaluation, targets are set by all employees at the beginning of each  fiscal year, the

After each evaluation, a feedback interview is held to communicate the strength and weakness, which will

contribute to future performance and competency development. Thus, we encourage them to improve their

performance and build their careers by ensuring deep understanding and objectivity.

We also give 360-degree feedback to the executive level and the line and other managers at the management

level. This is an opportunity to raise awareness of their managerial qualities, strength and weakness and to

encourage them to make improvements by understanding observation from various perspectives such as

subordinates, coworkers, related departments, and other concerned parties.

Creation of a workplace where people feel "job satisfaction"(cid:1561)

Through a variety of initiatives, MUFG develops professional

human resources who can add value to the services provided by
the Group, while aiming to create an organization that will enable
us to provide greater value to its customers and society.
In addition, in order for the entire group to take on the challenge
of retransforming the culture, it is important to create a workplace

in which each and every employee f inds their job reward. Through
the annual MUFG Group Awareness and Engagement Survey,

the Group identif ies the issues its employees face and uses them

to study and take a variety of measures.
The Bank requests employees to complete a simple survey that

asks about their day-to-day motivation, health and workplace environment via company's portal site. The Trust
also conducts organizational diagnosis through weekly pulse surveys. The results are shared with employees to

help identify and resolve problems at the early stage, promoting the creation of a healthy and open-minded
workplace environment.

Empowering Employees to Develop a Sense of Ownership about Purpose — “MY
Way × MUFG Way”

In FY2021, we held MUFG Way Integration Sessions with the objective of encouraging employees to discover
how relevant the MUFG Way is to their day-to-day tasks and actions.
Each session began with self-reflection, with attendees asked to consider their value systems, beliefs and
aspirations so that they may better articulate them as “My Way.” They were then asked to develop their own
interpretations of the MUFG Way in light of the policies upheld by the respective branch and division they belong
to, and missions currently assigned to them. These interpretations were shared among attendees, who usually
came from the same workplace, and they engaged in free discussions on that basis.
In addition, a cascade-down approach was used in these sessions, with Group CEO Kamezawa becoming the
first to share his personal definition of the MUFG Way with officers overseeing Group companies. This sharing of
“My Way” then progressed from officers to general managers of branches and divisions, and from general
managers to their staff. The number of sessions held in Japan and overseas thus exceeded 3,000 and involved
more than 50,000 employees.
Comments voiced by participants included, “I began to feel a sense of intimacy after hearing the personal life

stories of my supervisor and what he/she really thinks about his/her job, things that I would never have known”

and “The session helped me to recall what I was aiming for when I had just joined the Company. It was a good

opportunity to seriously think about how I envision my contribution to customers and society as a whole.” On the

other hand, some participants commented that “It is hard to translate the Purpose into my tasks.” Therefore, it

can be concluded that we are only halfway to our goal of empowering employees to develop a robust sense of

ownership about the Purpose.

In FY2022, we updated these sessions into “MUFG Way Employee Sessions,” focusing on helping attendees

reexamine the relationship between “My Way” and the MUFG Way and develop tangible definitions of the

stakeholders they aim to serve and how they will contribute to such stakeholders through their duties at MUFG.

We thus are encouraging all employees, including those who are in non-managerial positions, to frankly
exchange their thoughts on these matters with their supervisors, team members and other colleagues.

Management Strategies and Performance—Corporate Transformation

Transform Our Corporate Culture / Human Resources Strategy
Roundtable Discussion—Inclusion & Diversity
— Meaning of “Equity” in MUFG

MUFG focuses on Inclusion and Diversity (I&D) as one of its key strategies, which is one of the 10 Priority 
Issues in MUFG’s Sustainability Management. Head of Global HR interviewed regional I&D leaders.

Head of Inclusion & 
Diversity for EMEA

Kiat Siong Khoo
Assistant Vice President, 
Talent Development and 
Culture, Global Human 
Resources, Asia

Where We Are and Necessity of Global Strategy

Angus: First of all, I would like to ask each of you what is your 
view about the current MUFG? 

Okeatta: When I joined MUFG in 2021, I learned there were several 
meaningful engagements in process in the Americas, including 
the launch of an Executive I&D Council made up of our CEO, 
CHRO, and leaders from our Enterprise Resource Groups (ERG) 
and Business Unit I&D Councils, and CSR resulting in several 
initiatives designed to impact change. However, there seemed to 
be a lack of clear goals and objectives aligned to a “north star,” an 
I&D vision. The opportunity surfaced to build an enterprise I&D 
strategy that includes success measures that were impactful 
enough to shift behaviours, which are necessary to transform a 
culture and effect change internally and externally. We must invest 
in I&D as a business imperative and a competitive advantage. 

Jennifer: EMEA has a clear commitment to I&D through our 
EMEA strategy with “strengthening our culture” set out as a 
core pillar. Our EMEA Employee Network programme is one of 
many critical components of this and consists of seven 
resource networks that help us to establish a working 
environment that embraces and celebrates the diversity of our 
people. These networks offer our employees community, 
connection and a sense of belonging, all of which help to 
increase and maintain employee engagement. However, our 
approach remains very regional and reactive. From my 
perspective, the obvious next step for MUFG is a global 
Diversity, “Equity” and Inclusion (DEI) strategy. 

Kiat: I’ve been with the bank for just over 4 years and in this 
rather short time, I can see I&D and cultural transformation has 
been changed in MUFG, particularly in APAC. Employees 
currently in the organization could also see this as an opportunity 
to progress with their career especially in regions/countries 
where DEI has been neglected for a while. The world is rapidly 
changing and more and more issues around I&D are being 
surfaced daily. Now that DEI is high on everyone’s agenda, we 
can better manage this situation by framing the priorities for the 
teams working on it.

Sayaka: In Singapore where I worked until the beginning of 
2021, our colleagues have various nationalities, cultures, 
careers, and all are very diversified. After I came back to Tokyo, 
I again realized that there is a huge gap between Japan and 
overseas offices. In Japan, it is homogeneous where most 
employees in Head Office are Japanese, important roles are 
assigned to men, etc. I strongly believe diverse talent will 
enable us to tackle diverse issues; talent, that can leverage 
their skills through an effective network and courageous 
communication with colleagues.

Regional Focus and “Equity”

Angus: We want to create a diverse, equitable and inclusive 
environment which fosters all talents for the better of MUFG 
– focusing on diversity of thought, inputs and experience, 
equity of treatment in all we do and creating an environment 
that is inclusive for all where all can thrive. Then, what each 
region is doing under this global banner and respective focus 
on where you have gaps, and how do you care for these gaps 
over the next period in your region?

Sayaka: In Japan, one of our top priorities is to solve the gender 
gap. We have increased the target % representation of female 
management in Japan from 18% to 20% by fiscal 2023, but it is 
still on the way to reach to 30% set out by government. We are 
supporting education of women by providing various learning 
and development programs and mentoring programs, in 
collaboration with Business Units, etc. In addition, we are focused 
on increasing mid-career hiring of SMEs (Subject Matter Experts), 
leadership assignments to locally hired staff and stable 
employment of people with disabilities and LGBTQ colleagues, 
moving forward to cultivate an inclusive corporate culture. 

Globally, “Equity” will be introduced to shift to “Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion.” This is not “equality” in which we provide the same 
things to various people, but “equity” where we provide 
appropriate support to each individual. I think “equity” is critical

Financial Data /

Kiat: MUFG APAC is a diverse region, 18 different countries, many 
cultures, languages, and differing legislations impacting each of 
our respective locations. Therefore, we seek to become as 
inclusive as possible through our diversities of gender or races etc. 
We are doing this by ensuring we have the right mix of gender 
diversification at all levels in global, regional and local projects. 

Another practical approach, for example: we are setting up diverse 
employee teams, bringing together all levels, and a wide 
representation of staff, to give them a voice for continuous 
improvement and to enable their contribution to business decisions. 

Additionally, we have partner banks in the region, and this adds 
a level of energy and enthusiasm to how we work together and 
leverage the diversity that they also bring to MUFG APAC.

Jennifer: In EMEA, fostering a culture of collaboration, inclusivity, 
diversity, empowerment, and high performance is one of the four 
pillars of our EMEA strategy. Firstly, we focus on increasing 
diverse representation in line with the commitments we have 
made to the Women in Finance Charter and Race at Work 
Charter. We link accountability for achieving approved targets to 
executive performance through our EMEA Leadership objective, 
by monitoring and reporting on key diversity metrics. We also 
implement initiatives to support the learning, development and 
progression of diverse talent through initiatives such as our 
Reverse Mentoring programme. 

Okeatta: In the Americas, we were able to develop a 
comprehensive DEI strategy with key performance indicators 
that include a focus on increasing gender, race, and ethnicity 
representation at senior levels, DEI learning and leadership 
development programs, and a plan for building an inclusive 
culture. We will use the remainder of the calendar year to 
operationalize our enterprise DEI strategy to include: 1) enhancing 
our governance model to leverage a top-down and bottom-up 
approach, 2) strengthen accountability at our most senior levels 
and for all people managers by introducing specific DEI 
management objectives starting in fiscal 2022, 3) investing in a 
comprehensive DEI learning and development platform and so on. 

Sayaka: We must solve the situation where employees cannot 
fully utilise their ability due to their identity and environment. 
Additional investment in these employees will help to draw on 
their capabilities and have a positive impact on others, which will 
facilitate a merit-based system, or culture of “pay for performance,” 
ensuring that the right person is in the right role. This will make 
individuals and our organization resilient, which is a target of 
pursuing “equity.” Each region’s action is to ensure “equity.”

Each region has different issues, so actions are diversified. 
However, our global goal is to ensure equitable opportunities for 
all employees so they may maximize their capability within an 
inclusive culture and with psychological safety. This will change 
the culture and create value.

Direction

Angus: You are fostering global collaboration in addition to 
regional focus. What are you aiming at?

Okeatta: We are working to define a global “north star” and set 
clear objectives and key performance indicators to track and 
measure year-over-year progress of our journey to becoming the 
most trusted financial group.

Jennifer: I’m excited about the progress we’re making towards 
building an integrated global DEI strategy. In EMEA, we’ve 
focused on I&D until now but recognise the importance of 
including equity. This change will allow us to take a more global 
approach in reviewing the policies, practices and processes that 
impact our employees, ensuring that someone’s identity bears 
no impact on their ability to achieve their full potential and 
ambitions at MUFG.

Okeatta: The DEI strategy for the Americas includes a focus on 
workforce, culture, marketplace, and community. We must ask 
ourselves if we are being inclusive when we consider the 
products and services we offer and procure. A community focus 
is also integral to our DEI strategy. Supporting organizations and 
strategic collaborations dedicated to social justice, racial equity, 
gender equity, culture, arts, and economic prosperity within 
underserved communities through investment, volunteering, and 
charitable donations demonstrates our commitment to ESG. 

Sayaka: I believe that by leveraging our global and regional 
network, we can lead the discussion with our customers and 
clients addressing social issues. This is also our mission as a 
global bank.

Angus: Let’s promote DEI globally. This will not only change 
corporate culture, but also connect to our MUFG Purpose—
Committed to empowering a bright future.

Our initiatives since 2006 are as shown below. Initially, our main objective was to improve the job satisfaction of
female employees, However, since 2010, we have expanded the scope of our initiatives with the aim of improving

the job satisfaction of not only female employees but also diverse employees. Moving forward, we will further
focus our efforts on creating workplaces where all employees of the Group can demonstrate their unique

strengths and make diversity empower a brighter future.

Compensation System

MUFG’s compensation system for Executives, etc. is not only aimed at ensuring the achievement of short-term

performance targets but also intended to better incentivize these individuals to contribute to a medium- to long-

term improvement in corporate value and encourage them to take on the challenge of driving innovation.

In FY2022, we also added inclusion & diversity targets to qualitative assessment indicators for determining the

amount of bonuses vis-à-vis the execution status of the recipients’ duties, in order to facilitate management

efforts to promote and secure the robust employee understanding of inclusion & diversity.

We are creating a workplace where each one of our diverse employees can demonstrate their abilities.

Female Employees

Promoting gender diversity, particularly increasing the

percentage of female in managerial positions, is a priority
issue. MUFG set medium- to long-term targets and is

developing the ability of women and promoting their
appointment in higher positions under the commitment of
the top management. We provide training for selected
employees and mentoring programs for female employees
in senior positions to encourage their aspirations to
become executives and provide opportunities for them to
acquire advanced skills.

Setting Numerical Targets

At the Bank, the Trust Bank and the Securities, our joint

numerical goal is to raise the ratio of women holding
positions of line manager or higher to 20% in Japan by the
end of March 2024.

 This figure is to reflect diverse

(note)

perspectives and values in areas closer to management,
and serves as a milestone to achieve at least 30% in the
medium- to long-term. In addition to the joint numerical
targets of the three companies, each company has set its
own numerical targets to promote the appointment of
female employees.

As of March 31, 2022, the ratio of female managers in the Bank, the Trust Bank, and the Securities (combined in

Japan) was 18%.

employees in the three companies, providing complementary opportunities to acquire skills such as strategy

building and logical thinking, while sophisticating their corporate management perspective and big-picture

perspective for their future success in higher-level positions.

In addition to providing online networking opportunities for those who wish to consult with such as senior

employees on issues related to balancing career and life events, the Group also offers a variety of programs at

each Group company in response to each perceived issue.

We conduct training for managers and managerial candidates. For 5th year employees, training aimed at formulating a career vision and eliminating unease relating to

life events and one's career is offered. In addition, a town hall meeting for female employees was held online, with three female executives taking the stage.

With the aim of supporting the autonomous growth opportunities of each employee, we provide career advice by holding seminars on career planning, follow-up

seminars after changing career track, and assigning mentors to managerial candidates.

ACOM provides a Career Design Program to help female employees continue working, fulfilling careers. It holds panel discussions participated in by female

employees who actually balance work and childcare, providing an opportunity to consider and overcome the barriers that women face in their careers.

Programs to Support Continuation of Career

To support the continuation of career, we established programs for re-employing ex-employees who left the company when their spouses were transferred abroad,

giving a special leave of absence and changing work locations.

holding seminars on career planning, follow-up seminars after changing career track, and assigning mentors to
managerial candidates.

ACOM

ACOM provides a Career Design Program to help female employees continue working, fulfilling careers. It holds
panel discussions participated in by female employees who actually balance work and childcare, providing an
opportunity to consider and overcome the barriers that women face in their careers.

Programs to Support Continuation of Career

To support the continuation of career, we established programs for re-employing ex-employees who left the

company when their spouses were transferred abroad, giving a special leave of absence and changing work

locations.

LGBTQ

MUFG Human Rights Policy Statement

MUFG clearly prohibits any harassment or discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender

identity, aiming to create workplaces where all employees can stay true to themselves, regardless of sexual

orientation, gender identity, etc.

Policies and Guidelines

Providing Training Opportunities and Publishing a Handbook

Each Group company conducts e-learning and other trainings that include case studies to help them acquire
correct understanding and raise awareness for the prevention of discrimination and prejudice. We publish

LGBTQ Handbook for Workplaces, which outline the attitudes to be taken in the workplace and how to deal with
situations that may occur. It has been used mainly by superiors of LGBTQ employees.
In February 2022, we held a workshop to think about inclusive books and picture books depicting sexual diversity.

Recognition of Same-Sex Partnership

The Bank, the Trust Bank, the Securities, NICOS, MUS Business Service and MUS Information Systems have
introduced a same-sex partnership recognition program that regards employees' same-sex partners as being
equivalent to opposite-sex spouses and that allows them to be beneficially of company benefits such as special
paid leave and rent subsidies.

Effort to Visualize Allies

As part of our efforts to foster an LGBTQ inclusive workplace, we created
original straps in six rainbow colors and distributed them to employees
who wish to wear them.  Making Ally, a person who supports LGBTQ,

more visible in the company and providing an opportunity for other

employees to become aware of the existence of LGBTQ people.

Pride Month

Events that show support for the LGBTQ community are held all over the world every year in June, which has
been designated as Pride Month.
MUFG’s US sites displayed Pride Month messages at ATMs and other locations at branches on the West Coast
during the month of June and held a campaign called "Show Your Colors" to solicit photos of employees wearing
rainbow-colored clothing, among other activities.

At our European sites, we held pride art exhibitions to exhibit works by LGBTQ artists in the lobby of our

European Headquarters building as well as film screenings.

In Japan, in addition to announcing Pride Month on the Group Portal site, we are also working on employee
1(cid:23)(cid:23)
participation-based activities, such as soliciting ideas for social contribution activities that can perform as an ally
through the Pride Alliance, an employee community using the Microsoft Teams.

who have reached a particular age, we have introduced training and programs to facilitate skill development with

the aim of supporting future career development based on diverse values. For motivated employees above
retirement age, we have established a continuous employment system with flexible work arrangements to

provide stable work opportunities and respond to diverse employment needs.

In order to create workplace environments that allow

employees to balance work and childcare regardless of

gender, MUFG Group companies are carrying out

initiatives to encourage male employees to take childcare

leave, thereby raising awareness on more balanced work

styles and promoting better understanding of colleagues

who are working while raising children. Since FY2019, we

have begun encouraging male employees to take

childcare leave of about one month, among other

initiatives.

Starting in FY2019, the Bank is encouraging employees
to take days off for 20 working days for the purpose of childcare, by combining 10-working-day paid childcare
leave with 10-working-day annual paid leave, and it was named Ten Plus Ten. It also internally announces the

1(cid:23)9

names of the departments of employees who have taken 20 working days off. More than 300 employees have

taken childcare leaves so far, after contacting the employees and their supervisors to promote the acquisition of

the leave and introducing examples of experienced employees balancing work and family life.

Since FY2019, we have encouraged male employees to take childcare leave by setting a target utilization rate of

In order to create workplace environments that allow

employees to balance work and childcare regardless of

gender, MUFG Group companies are carrying out

initiatives to encourage male employees to take childcare

leave, thereby raising awareness on more balanced work

styles and promoting better understanding of colleagues

who are working while raising children. Since FY2019, we

have begun encouraging male employees to take

childcare leave of about one month, among other
initiatives.

Starting in FY2019, the Bank is encouraging employees
to take days off for 20 working days for the purpose of childcare, by combining 10-working-day paid childcare

leave with 10-working-day annual paid leave, and it was named Ten Plus Ten. It also internally announces the
names of the departments of employees who have taken 20 working days off. More than 300 employees have

taken childcare leaves so far, after contacting the employees and their supervisors to promote the acquisition of
the leave and introducing examples of experienced employees balancing work and family life.

In FY 2021, we launched an employee community called "IkuKyari Lounge" using Microsoft Teams for working

By 2025, all baby boomers in Japan (born between 1947 and 1949) will be 75 years of age or older. The increase
in the number of elderly people needing nursing care and the resulting increase in the number of people leaving

jobs to take care of their family members are expected to become major social problems.
Under such circumstances, MUFG established a variety of support programs, in addition to the provision of a

variety of information, to help employees balance work and caregiving so that they could continue to work while
taking care of their family members in need of nursing care.

Creating an Inclusive Workplace

Raising Management Awareness

The awareness of managers is one of the important factors in determining the success or failure of inclusion &
diversity. We implement a variety of initiatives to penetrate an awareness of the diverse values and private lives

of junior employees, enhancing job reward, and producing results.

Providing Various Training

A wide range of training programs is offered, depending on the circumstances and priorities of each Group
company. The Bank, the Trust Bank, and the Securities hold training sessions for newly appointed general

managers, chief managers and senior managers to teach them the importance of being aware of unconscious
biases and building a team with psychological safety in order to develop organizations and teams where each of
the diverse employees can play an active role. For existing managers, we prepared opportunities to deepen their
understanding of inclusion & diversity and to reflect on themselves through e-learning, on-demand video and
personnel evaluation and other programs.

Initiatives of Group Companies

Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS

We regularly hold seminars for managers every year to provide hints on new management styles in response to
changes in the social environment, provide opportunities to reflect on themselves, and practice diversity
management.

ACOM

Leadership enhancement training is provided to improve organizational capabilities. Participants learn how to
enhance their mindset as a leader, acquire one-on-one skills, and improve their ability to build relationships in

order to facilitate the growth of subordinates.

Culture Creation

We are implementing a variety of initiatives to develop a corporate culture in which the diversity of employees is

mutually recognized and respected.

Inclusion & Diversity Month

The Bank, the Trust Bank and the Securities have designated November of each year as Inclusion & Diversity

Month (formerly Diversity Month), and training as well as workshops are held at all Group locations in Japan. The
174
companies focus on a hot topic, such as Unconscious Bias, and create opportunities for employees to consider
inclusion & diversity as an issue that could exert inf luence on themselves.

Enlightenment through Group Portal Site

Various columns on the theme of Inclusion and Diversity are serialized to promote understanding and raise

awareness among employees.

Raising Awareness about Unconscious Bias

Since FY2019, we have been focusing on raising awareness about

unconscious bias. In addition to awareness-raising training for all

employees, we also provide training for newly appointed managers to

raise their awareness about unconscious bias. In FY 2022, we published

Unconscious Bias Handbook, which includes guidelines for inclusive

expression in addition to a series of columns that allow us to learn about

bias through comics.

Promotion of Flexible Work Styles

Each company is working on initiatives to increase productivity and promote a healthy work-life balance, such as

introducing telecommuting system, staggered working hours, flexible time system, and non-territorial offices.

bonds (gender bonds) to support the financial

needs of women entrepreneurs.
Proceeds from the bond issuance are used to

finance women-led small and medium-sized
enterprises in Thailand.  Through the issuance of

these bonds, the bank provided opportunities for

the underserved women in SME segment to access
financial services and contributed to the

development of the fast-growing social bond market
in Asia.
Through the provision of these bonds, Krungsri was
presented with multiple awards and recognition as
below.

Social Loans to Help Secure Housing for All People

The Bank provided a social loan to a rental housing business provided by Fortress Investment Group (Fortress)
to people with housing needs. Focusing on the social issue of shortage of housing for low- and middle-income
people, Fortress has expanded the use of government-run employment promotion housing for job seekers to
include foreigners, single mothers, the elderly, and other people who have difficulty securing housing. It is

operated as low-priced rental housing.

MUFG supports the provision of funds to provide safe and secure rental housing with simple rental procedures

and low rent for all.

Donations for Supporting Women's Health

As part of our efforts to support women's health, we
made a donation to the Japan Society of Fertility

Preservation in order to spread accurate
information on breast cancer and cervical cancer

(methods for early detection and prevention, etc.).
In recent years, cancers specific to women have

become more common among younger ages, with
an increasing number of cases occurring in their

20s to 40s. Amongst them, breast cancer is the
most common followed by cervical cancer.
Continuous medical examinations are important for
early detection of cancer. In particular, the medical
examination rate of cervical cancer, which occurs among those intheir 20s and requires screening at a young
age, is as low as 25.7%. Also, the HPV vaccination rate is low.

MUFG believes that it is important to realize a society in which women can build life plans with peace of mind and

play active roles in various situations. Through the Japan Society of Fertility Preservation, MUFG will promote
early detection and prevention methods such as continuous medical examinations for cancer among young
women.

Activities to Support People with Disabilities

In FY2021, based on the ideas of our employees, we donated a total of approximately eight million yen to 20
organizations supporting people with disabilities throughout Japan, and participated in activities to support people
with disabilities and their families together with each organization.

Major Activities
(cid:1566)Project for learning about “Parent and Child Respite,” which supports children with intractable diseases and
their families
(cid:1566)Project to support the independence of children with disabilities around the world and to realize a barrier-free
society
(cid:1566)Project for providing temporary daycare support for people with disabilities to help them during the Covid-19
pandemic
(cid:1566)Project to support the creative activities of people with disabilities
(cid:1566)Project to support after-school childcare clubs with inclusion of children with disabilities

Mitsubishi UFJ Business Partner (a special subsidiary of the Bank) supports the employment of students with

disabilities by giving lectures on career and employment at support schools where employees with disabilities

graduated.

Activities to Support LGBTQ

Sponsoring the Largest LGBTQ Pride Event in Japan

We support and sponsor Tokyo Rainbow Pride*,
held annually at Yoyogi Park in Tokyo.

In 2021 and 2022, collaborating with Mizuho

Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group, MUFG participated in the event. The three
companies hosted online booths, posted in social
media, and created video messages that were used

Donations to NPO

In FY2021, we made a donation to Nijiiro Diversity, a non-profit organization that provides supports for LGBTQ
community, to help purchase books on LGBTQ issues and bookshelves to be provided at their new facilities.

Implementation of a Variety of Universal Support

Universal Design

In order to ensure that all customers can use our services with peace of mind, MUFG is working to
introduce universal design in both software and hardware, including customer service (hospitality) that takes all
customers into consideration and the creation of safe and secure stores (facilities).

Promoting for Customer Satisfaction

Provision of Information to Customers

We provide MUFG's Inclusion & Diversity initiatives to various customers, as well as opportunities for MUFG's

female managers to talk about their career paths, supporting promotion of Inclusion & Diversity among our

business partners.

We also offer consulting services in cooperation with Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting.

Mitsubishi UFJ Business Partner (a special subsidiary of the Bank) hosts in-house tours to share initiatives and

knowledge related to the employment of people with disabilities, contributing to the expansion of employment

opportunities for people with disabilities in the society.

Promoting Workstyle Reforms

MUFG has positioned promoting work style reforms as one of the 10 priority issues to be addressed via

revision of administrative procedures and the streamlining of meeting practices while going paperless and

will help society as a whole achieve higher productivity, in addition to making us more productive.

Opinions and requests we receive from customers

are valuable assets of MUFG. The Group
companies – the Bank, the Trust Bank, the

Securities, NICOS and ACOM - analyze customer
feedback received via employees at sales of ices,
by telephone and by email to make improvements.

The  ive companies received about 184,485

opinions and requests from customers in total in  -
fiscal 2021, of which 165 were utilized for service

improvement.
In response to requests for enhancement of

procedures that do not require face-to-face
interactions, eKYC authentication, a new

authentication method, was introduced in the
"Smart Account Opening App" to speed up account

number notification, and eKYC authentication was
added to the "Mitsubishi UFJ Direct (Internet
Banking)" and "Kantan Tetsuduki App" procedures
to expand the number of cases where procedures
can be completed without face-to-face interactions.
In addition, we are expanding the scope of the app usage, including account cancellation and loss procedures,
and will continue to expand our channel services that do not require face-to-face interactions in the future. 
MUFG collects, analyzes, and shares the opinions and requests from customers of all Group companies, and we

use this feedback to improve our products and services. We continue to attract customers and establish lasting
relationships with them.

Result for CS Sureveys for Customers

To confirm whether our efforts are meeting customer expectations, each Group company conducts
questionnaires via postal mail and online, and regularly checks customer satisfaction (CS) and strives to improve
the quality of our products and services.
In a satisfaction survey conducted by individual five business categories in 2021, approximately 60-70% of

customers rated their overall level of satisfaction with various transactions as "satisfactory" or "somewhat

satisfied."

Each Group company will continue to analyze the factors for items that received low evaluations in the

questionnaire and work for improvement.

Corporate Social Responsibility Activities

Under our Purpose of “Committed to empowering a brighter future.” MUFG has identified 10 priority issues,
including responses to the aging population & low birthrate, along with climate change measures &

environmental protection, as we work to resolve social issues and achieve a sustainable society through financial
services and business activities.

At the same time, to address social issues that are difficult to deal with our core businesses, we have put in place
a framework that utilizes approximately 1% of net business profits to give back to society, and we are undertaking

various social contribution activities, including donations and volunteer work.
As a global financial institution, we try to make the most of the size and strength of our group and the passion of

our employees by being conscious of global social issues, while preserving the rich culture we have cultivated in
Japan. We also aim to create ecosystems and platforms that provide solutions to social issues by strengthening
ties with stakeholders and empathizing with each other for future generations, society, and the planet.
As MUFG, we will actively contribute to society by carrying out activities that make stories that our employees
can be proud of and to be passed on to the world. 

Five Priority Areas and Our Underlying Thoughts and Values

Within the framework of our CSR activities, MUFG has identified the following five priority areas: Development of
the Next Generation and Support for Children, Environmental Conservation, Financial and Economic Education,
Preservation and Succession of Culture, and Disaster Relief among other support.
Focusing on these five priority areas, MUFG's five group companies work together to implement selected
activities based on the following thoughts and values. 

Carrying out activities that embody MUFG’s Purpose of being “Committed to empowering a brighter future.”

Resolving the 10-priority environmental and social issues.

Contributing to the creation of sustainable mechanisms and frameworks for resolving issues.

Taking advantage of our wide range of connections with communities and people in order to carry out

activities.

Donation to Ashinaga Foundation and the Japan Student Services Organization

MUFG donated 500 million yen each to the Ashinaga Foundation and the Japan Student Services Organization
(1 billion in total) to support children who were almost forced to give up their higher education, despite their
motivation and ability. This was due to financial and other reasons as a result of the spread of COVID-19, and
children who had lost their parents due to illness or disaster. 

Support for Children's Lives and Education

Donations to Child Support Groups

Since FY 2020, MUFG has been supporting

CliniClowns Japan, an NPO that supports children

fighting disease, as well as the NPO's Learning for ALL

and Chance for Children. Both of which are public

interest incorporated associations that support children

from less forunate backgrounds (180 million yen so

far).

Support for Hydrogen Fueled Bus

Various initiatives are currently underway to realize a
hydrogen energy-based society in Japan. Among

them, the introduction of fuel cell buses (hydrogen
buses) as commercial vehicles is attracting attention

because it is expected to create stable hydrogen
demand while contributing to decarbonization.

Against this backdrop, MUFG made donations to the
Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, Osaka
City Bus, and Nankai Bus to support their promotion

and introduction of hydrogen fueled buses. 

MUFG Forest for Working Together with Customers

MUFG is undertaking the MUFG Forest Project, which
involves planting about 100,000 trees and donating a
total of 500 million yen over 10 years to fund their
cultivation. 100,000 trees absorb CO2 that is
equivalent to the annual CO2 emissions from the
electricity use for the cooling of 10,000
households.MUFG plants trees through the Present

(note 1) The Present Tree project was started by Environmental Relations in January 2005. Through this project, participants

forests should be created, such as forests damaged in natural disasters, former development sites, and abandoned clear-cutting

sites in various parts of Japan, where the birthrate is declining, and the population is aging.

Support for Cyclic Utilization of Forests

In recent years, the abandonment of artificial forests planted for timber

production has become a serious social issue. In light of this, MUFG made
donations (60 million yen in total) to the Lifestyle Research Institute of
Forests, which is engaged in forest conservation activities as part of our
efforts to promote the cyclic utilization of forest resources, in which trees
are planted, grown, harvested, used, and planted again.

Furthermore, MUFG employee volunteers made educational puzzles using

thinned wood. The finished puzzles were donated to kindergartens and
other children's facilities.

Support for Cyclic Utilization of Forests

In recent years, the abandonment of artificial forests planted for timber

production has become a serious social issue. In light of this, MUFG made
donations (60 million yen in total) to the Lifestyle Research Institute of

Forests, which is engaged in forest conservation activities as part of our
efforts to promote the cyclic utilization of forest resources, in which trees

are planted, grown, harvested, used, and planted again.
Furthermore, MUFG employee volunteers made educational puzzles using

thinned wood. The finished puzzles were donated to kindergartens and
other children's facilities.

To leave bountiful forests for the next generation, we will continue to

support forest conservation activities, including tree planting, thinning, and
the use of thinned wood.

Financial and Economic Education

MUFG provides financial and economic education as part of its community service activities. We offer a variety of

programs while taking advantage of the unique characteristics as a financial group. 

Workplace Experience for Students

MUFG Bank (the Bank) is providing financial and economic education to elementary, junior high, and high school

students in local communities through a workplace experience, primarily at local branches, retail banking
customer service centers, and schools where employees conduct classes. In this program, students learn about
the economy, finance, and the role of banks in society. In addition, they have the opportunity to interview
employees, asking questions such as "What things do you value when it comes to your job?" and "What is it like
to work as a team?" Through these interviews, and the first-hand experience of working, the program provides
children with career guidance.

Learning Program for Elementary Schools (The VALUE of Money)

Since FY 2022, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities has been offering a learning program for elementary
schools called "The VALUE of Money". In this program, elementary school students explore positive ways to
manage money through conversations and group discussions. By thinking about questions such as "What are
good spending habits?" students gain not only a superficial knowledge of finance and how it works, but also an
experiential understanding of the role of money and economics in life.Children who participated in the program
gave feedback such as, "I thought that being good with money meant simply saving it, but through the program, I

learned that it meant spending money carefully.” 

Internship Program (Dynamics of the Stock Market) for Junior High
and High School Students

Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities (the Securities Business) is offering an internship program (Dynamics

of the Stock Market, or Kabu no Chikara), a unique educational program about the economy and finance.
Developed in cooperation with Educa & Quest Co., Ltd., the program consists of five classes where students
learn about stocks. At the conclusion of the program, students are asked in groups to express what they learned
about "Dynamics of the stock market", in the form of advertisements on a mock newspaper advert for the
Securities Business. The students then give a presentation on these advertisements to the class. 
In FY 2021, approximately 400 students participated from eight private junior high and high schools in areas

around Tokyo and made a total of approximately 130 advertisements. Of the participating students, eleven teams

composed of representatives from each school (22 students in total) were formed to present their works online.
At the presentation, the chairman and the president of the Securities Business gave warm words of
encouragement to the students. This initiative has received high praise as it is promoted on a companywide basis

20(cid:23)

while leveraging the Securities Business’s core business expertise. At the 9th Career Education Awards held by

the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry for FY 2018, this initiative won the Encouragement Award in the

large corporation section.

Internship Program (Dynamics of the Stock Market) for University

Students

Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities (the Securities Business) has been offering an internship program

(Dynamics of the Stock Market, or Kabu no Chikara) for university students since 2019, and over 400 students

from 14 colleges have attended the program.

In this program, participating students work to solve social issues using the characteristics of stocks. Each 90-

minute class is conducted in a group work format, and in the first half, the Securities Business’s employees

lecture on the functions and roles of the stock market and securities companies. In the second half, students

select the goals they want to achieve from among the 17 development targets (goals) of the SDGs and devise

solutions using the characteristics and functions of stocks and securities they learned in the first half. At the end

of the class, each group presents their solutions. Participating students have given positive feedback, such as “I

was able to learn from a different perspective compared to my macroeconomics classes. It was a great learning

opportunity,” “I gained a better understanding of the SDGs,” and “I want to join a securities company in the

future.” 

ACOM's Support for Financial Education

ACOM is holding lectures for students regarding the knowledge of money,

such as loans and credit, family budget management, and the outline of

the consumer credit industry. ACOM delivers these awareness-raising

lectures with the hope that students will be able to use their money well

before they start working and avoid getting into financial trouble in the

future. During FY 2021, lectures were given at eight universities, two high

schools, and one other organization with about 700 participants in total.

Global Volunteer Month "MUFG Gives Back"

Since the establishment of Global Volunteer Month in

2013, MUFG employees all over the world have been
working together on initiatives to host local CSR

activities. In the wake of the Great East Japan
Earthquake, Japan was blessed with support from across
the world for its reconstruction efforts. In response, and
as an opportunity to express gratitude for the support
Japan received, we have named these initiatives "MUFG

Gives Back", and we continue to expand our activities
each year. As a global initiative, in which employees are
engaged in CSR activities together, MUFG Gives Back is

one of the largest CSR initiatives among Japanese
corporates, representing an opportunity for employees in

their respective areas and at their respective branches to experience the impact of local philanthropy. In FY 2021,

we implemented the "Happy Christmas Together!" project in Japan. MUFG employees created about 1,700

Christmas cards that were delivered through the CliniClowns Japan, a certified NPO, to children in pediatric
wards at 52 hospitals around Japan and to children receiving treatment at home. 

Participation in FIT For Charity Run

The Financial Industry in Tokyo (FIT) For Charity Run is a
fun run organized as a volunteer charity event by
employees at companies involved in the financial
services industry. The participation fee paid by the
employee and cooperation fee provided by the
companies of participating runners is donated in support
of organizations that have roots in the community and
implement socially significant activities but are unable to
secure funding to support their activities due to lack of

recognition and other problems.MUFG has been

participating in the event since it was held for the fifth

time in 2009. In November 2021, about 360 employees from 12 group companies participated in the 17th run.

Acom “Miru” Concert Monogatari

ACOM has been inviting local citizens to “Acom 'Miru'
Concert Monogatari” performances all across Japan.
Ever since the first performance was staged in 1994,
more than 240,000 people have enjoyed upwards of 250
performances. The concerts are truly original works of art

that integrate colorful silhouettes and live renditions by a

piano trio (piano, violin, and cello) with narration.
Moreover, the concerts are held as barrier-free events,
with sign language translation provided on stage and

21(cid:23)

ample wheelchair places secured in the auditorium,

making it possible for everybody to have a good

time.Also, the concerts are run with the cooperation of many people, not only ACOM employees but also local

governments and community volunteers.For more information about the Acom 'Miru' Concert Monogatari, visit

Donations based on Employees' Ongoing Fund Raising (Established in 2011) 
Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS has continued to raise funds based on employees' salary deductions since September
2011 for the purpose of supporting reconstruction following the Great East Japan Earthquake. Through this

scheme, which also includes donations by the company, a total of 120 million yen had been donated by FY2021.
Currently, the company makes donations to the UNESCO Association Study Support Scholarship and the Great

East Japan Earthquake Fukushima Children's Fund.

The fundraiser was initiated by ACOM employees. Money collected through donation boxes installed

companywide and payroll deductions are donated as relief funds in the event of a major natural disaster. As of
August 31, 2021, the cumulative total of donations has reached approximately 12 million yen (100 donations). As

We have established MUFG Group Code of Conduct as a set of guidelines for a day to day judgement of how the
Group’s directors and employees should act to realize the MUFG Way. The code expresses our commitment to

complying with laws and regulations globally, to acting with honesty and integrity, and to behaving in a manner
that supports and  strengthens the trustand confidence of  society. 

In addition, as we expand the geographic scope of our business globally, we are committed to keeping abreast of
developments in laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including anti-money laundering
and anti-bribery rules as well as competition laws, while paying attention to trends in financial crimes.

Compliance Framework

Management and coordination of compliance-related matters are the responsibility of separate compliance
management divisions established at the holding company and the major subsidiaries, namely, the Bank, the
Trust Bank and the Securities (hereinafter, the “three subsidiaries”). Each compliance management division
formulates compliance programs and organizes training courses to promote compliance, and regularly reports to
each company’s board of directors and Executive Committee on the status of compliance activities.

The holding company has established a Group Compliance Committee while the three subsidiaries have
Compliance Committees under their executive committees to deliberate key issues related to compliance.

Additionally, the holding company has a Group Chief Compliance Officer, or CCO, Committee, which consists of

the CCO of the holding company and the CCOs of the three subsidiaries. The Group CCO Committee

deliberates important matters related to compliance and compliance-related issues for which the Group should

share a common understanding.

225

Whistle-Blowing Systems

Having positioned its whistle-blowing systems as an important governance tool, MUFG has helped each Group

company develop such a system to ensure their ability to identify compliance issues early so that any problems

can be quickly rectified. Moreover, the MUFG Compliance Helpline operates year-round and is capable of

handling a report from any Group member no matter what their location on an around-the-clock basis.

We made it a rule that the identities of consultors and the content of the report must be kept secret in the course

of handling reported issues so that whistle-blowers will not be subjected to detrimental treatment. This rule is

clearly stipulated in the Code of Conduct as well as in in-house rules enforced at each Group company. We are

thus ensuring thorough protection for whistle-blowers even as we carry out investigations into issues being

reported and conduct correction measures, including follow-up inspections.

In addition, we aim to ensure that each employee is able to quickly access this helpline whenever he/she has

even the slightest suspicion regarding compliance. To this end, we let all employees know about this helpline as

well as records on internal reporting accepted thus far. At the same time, we are striving to enhance the reliability

of our whistleblowing systems via, for example, the sharing of actual compliance-related cases in a form that

makes it impossible to determine the identities of whistleblowers.

In fiscal 2021, a total of 441 reports were accepted at MUFG and main Group companies. In line with the revised

Whistleblower Protection Act, which came into effect in June 2022, we have upgraded whistle-blowing systems in

place at MUFG as well as Group subsidiaries and affiliates, so that employees can feel more secure about using

the systems.

Details on MUFG's Integrated Risk Management are available on Risk Management.

Managing Environmental and Social Risks in Financing

Principles of Risk Management

MUFG has identif ied the risks associated with various environmental and social issues, such as response to
climate change & environmental protection, as a priority issue, and recognizes that they exert signif icant
influence on the Group's corporate management for sustainable growth. As a f inancial institution that aims to be
a trusted global f inancial group chosen by the world, the Group also grasps the risks caused by its business
activities and endeavors to control and reduce them. MUFG manages these sustainability-related risks within the
MUFG Environmental and Social Policy Framework, which is based on the MUFG Environmental Policy
Statement and the MUFG Human Rights Policy Statement. The Framework is managed by the Sustainability
Committee under the Executive Committee, and it is formed to be consistent with the framework for controlling
reputational risks that could damage the Group's corporate value.
In addition, the status of policies and initiatives to the environmental and social risks are discussed and reported
by the Credit & Investment Management Committee, the Credit Committee and the Risk Management Committee
depending on the theme. Conclusions reached by the above committees are reported to the Executive

Committee, and reported to and discussed by the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors oversees risks

related to environmental and social issues.

Risk Assessment Process

Standard due diligence is conducted by departments that have direct contact with customers to identify and

assess the environmental and social risks of business that is to be  financed by MUFG. If it is determined that the

business needs to be examined more carefully, MUFG conducts enhanced due diligence and decides whether or
not to f inance the business.
As for business that would have signi ficant environmental and social risks and could potentially damage MUFG's
corporate value or develop into a reputational risk, MUFG holds discussions on how to handle it within a

framework participated by senior management. In addition, the Bank adopted the Equator Principles, a

228

 
 
 
framework for identifying, assessing and controlling the environmental and social risks of large-scale projects,

and conducts risk assessments in accordance with its Guidelines.

Major Risks and Responses

MUFG designated business with significant environmental and social risks as "Prohibited Transactions" if they
are illegal businesses or businesses with illegal purposes and the like, and as "Transactions of High Caution" if
they have a negative impact on indigenous communities and the like. It has been tightening its policy on business
that has a signi ficant impact on climate change including coal- fired power generation. By periodically reviewing
and sophisticating the MUFG Environmental and Social Policy Framework, the Sustainability Committee will
continue to address risks that may emerge as a result of changes in business activities and the business

Main Initiatives to Counter Cyber Security Threats

Security Measures to Counter Growing Threats

Given current international situation and global threat of ransomware, the risk of cyber-attacks has been
increasing. MUFG sets up a dedicated team focused on threat intelligence to centralize the related activities such
as impact analysis for newly found vulnerabilities or past experiences, and remediation for those impacts on a
groupwide and global basis. Additionally, the team monitors systems for external stakeholders daily to prevent
any flaws in security updates or configuration settings.
In step with the widespread popularization of electronic payments on the internet such as Internet banking,
cybercrimes that target online services have also become social issues. MUFG is implementing a variety of
initiatives to deliver safe and secure services to customers, such as ensuring robust online verification,
thoroughgoing vulnerability countermeasures, threat intelligence, anomaly detection, and suspicious-transaction

monitoring.

Our Response to Digital Transformation (DX)

MUFG actively utilizes new technologies such as cloud services, AI, Robotics, and Open APIs for business.

The Cyber Security Division participates in the projects related to the new technologies from the early stages

such as planning and design phases. The activity contributes to the development of multilayered security

measures and the realization of coexistence between safety and technology-driven transformation through
proactive actions including procedure development for safe utilization of the new technology, risk evaluation, and
monitoring of configuration settings.

Nurturing Security Specialists

2(cid:20)1
Cyber security measures are a wide range of areas, including governance, threat intelligence, risk management,
engineering, monitoring operation, and incident response. MUFG has secured an in-house team capable of

Main Initiatives to Counter Cyber Security Threats

Security Measures to Counter Growing Threats

Given current international situation and global threat of ransomware, the risk of cyber-attacks has been

increasing. MUFG sets up a dedicated team focused on threat intelligence to centralize the related activities such

as impact analysis for newly found vulnerabilities or past experiences, and remediation for those impacts on a

groupwide and global basis. Additionally, the team monitors systems for external stakeholders daily to prevent

any flaws in security updates or configuration settings.

In step with the widespread popularization of electronic payments on the internet such as Internet banking,

cybercrimes that target online services have also become social issues. MUFG is implementing a variety of

initiatives to deliver safe and secure services to customers, such as ensuring robust online verification,

thoroughgoing vulnerability countermeasures, threat intelligence, anomaly detection, and suspicious-transaction

monitoring.

Our Response to Digital Transformation (DX)

MUFG actively utilizes new technologies such as cloud services, AI, Robotics, and Open APIs for business.

The Cyber Security Division participates in the projects related to the new technologies from the early stages

such as planning and design phases. The activity contributes to the development of multilayered security

measures and the realization of coexistence between safety and technology-driven transformation through
proactive actions including procedure development for safe utilization of the new technology, risk evaluation, and

monitoring of configuration settings.

managing and carrying out the above functions.
To ensure the robust implementation of each security measure, MUFG has systematically categorized the talents

and skill sets expected of security members to provide them with optimally designed human resource
development programs, which combine in-house and external lectures and exercises while giving due

consideration to the competencies of each member, the nature of tasks to be assigned to them and possible

opportunities for their future career advancement. Furthermore, MUFG has boldly pursued improvement of

security measures in order to keep up with constant changes in technology, utilization environment and cyber-
attacks, and to nurture them as professional through these opportunities.

Providing Cyber Security Education to Foster a Proper Culture

For MUFG to maintain the stable operation of its financial infrastructure, it is essential to foster the corporate
culture in which each employee understands the importance of cyber security and considers what should be
done as a company while acting in collaboration with other financial institutions or government authorities.
MUFG provides educational programs to not only employees directly involved in cyber security but also those
engaged in planning and promotion of the business services so that every employee is well-versed in necessary
countermeasures against cyber-attacks. Furthermore, MUFG provides all employees at main Group companies
with e-learning, phishing mail exercises, and newsletters for alerting cyber-attacks and familiarizing them proper
responses, and hosts seminars for widely scoped Group companies. MUFG also engaged in various activities
with external organizations, such as collaboration with Financials ISAC Japan, the IT security association of
financial institutions, and participation in various training programs and drills hosted by the NISC (National center
of Incident readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity), the Financial Services Agency, and the Tokyo Metropolitan
Police Department.

Combating Financial Crime

We are striving to provide services that our customers can feel secured by implementing a wide range of

countermeasures against financial crimes as well as providing assistance for victims of such financial crime.

Measures to Prevent customers from attacks by Bank Transfer Frauds

To prevent customers from bank transfer frauds at ATM which has been frequently occurring in Japan, we

provide necessary alerts to customers by using posters or guiding them on ATM displays etc. In addition, we
prohibit phone calls at ATM since mobile phones are often used for bank transfer frauds. Also, to prevent
customers from damages caused by those frauds, we have some restrictions to specified customers on
transactions by ATM which may cause a fraud case. When receiving requests to withdraw large amount of cash
or send money at the counter of our premises, our staff would give attention to customers and ask about the

purpose of the transaction, as well as cooperate with police to prevent crimes when the transaction seems

suspicious.
Furthermore, for those who open a new bank account, we would check and verify customers identification and
2(cid:20)2
confirm the purpose of opening the account. In addition, to prevent customers’ bank account from being abused

for financial crimes, we make continued efforts to give attention to customers about those crimes of selling,

buying, or handing over a bank account by using leaflets and our website.

Measures to Prevent Loss from Counterfeit or Stolen ATM Cards

IC cards have been introduced to prevent harm due to cash card forgery and theft. To prevent peeping, rearview

mirrors have been installed, and ATM screens have been equipped with polarized film and provided with

reminder displays about password management.

Security Measures for Internet Banking Service

A variety of effectual security measures have been established to prevent unauthorized third-party access and
fake transactions through phishing and computer viruses.
MUFG Bank (the Bank) and Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking (the Trust Bank) have introduced an electronic
certification system, which displays a warning message if an email from the Bank or the Trust Bank has been
tampered with. This system also allows customers to confirm on their computers that the server they access
during Internet transactions is authentic.
In addition, in order to authenticate online transactions for individual customers, the companies provide the “One-
Time Password Card,” giving the user a password that is valid only once per transaction. (the Bank and the Trust
Bank also provides this service through a smartphone application.) This service greatly reduces the risk of
fraudulent transactions by third parties.
Security measures for corporate customers include the Internet services “BizSTATION” (the Bank) and “the Bank
Business Direct” (the Trust Bank) and the provision of the “One-Time Password Card” (the Bank) and the “One-
Time Password Token” (the Trust Bank).
Furthermore, MUFG has been implementing various security measures such as suggesting customers to use
“Rapport”, a free anti-virus dedicated software to prevent customers' PCs from infecting malware while using our
Online Banking.

Efforts to Detect Unauthorized Credit Card Use

Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS is committed to complying with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

(PCIDSS), an international security standard for the credit card industry, developed to ensure the safe handling of

credit card membership data. In September 2010, we acquired compliance certification for the EC Card Payment

System, which provides credit card payments via the Internet. Since then, the scope of application has been

gradually expanded, and in December 2014, we have obtained compliance certification for major systems,

striving to maintain and improve security.

Also, in order to prevent customers from being involved in malicious credit card crimes, we have introduced a
fraud detection system which monitors customers’ credit cards 24/7 for unauthorized use by third parties.
In order for customers to use their credit cards with peace of mind, we may temporarily suspend the use of the
relevant credit cards and contact the card holders when suspicious transactions are detected on the credit card
accounts. For customers whose card information may have been leaked to a third party, we are taking measures

such as replacing the credit cards in issue with new cards.

Acquisition of ISO / IEC27001 Certification

2(cid:20)(cid:20)

Production systems' operational units of NICOS cards of Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS has acquired the internationally

recognized ISO/IEC 27001 certification for information security management systems as a part of their efforts to.

Acquired PrivacyMark (PMark) Licensed Operator Certification

NICOS and ACOM have obtained PrivacyMark (PMark) certification from the Japan Institute for Promotion of

Digital Economy and Community (JIPDEC) that evaluates the level of protection of personal information. Privacy

Mark (P Mark) certifies that the business operator complies with the JIS standard for personal information

(JISQ15001:2017), which has established a system to take appropriate protection measures for personal

information. We are working to maintain and improve the level of protection of customers' personal information.

In accordance with the MUFG Way, MUFG Group recognizes its social responsibility to handle customers'
personal information, Individual Numbers and specific personal information (hereafter, "specific personal

information, etc.") appropriately, and has established the MUFG Group Personal Information Protection Policy.
We do our utmost to ensure the protection of our customers' personal information and specified personal

information, etc., by having all executives and employees comply with this policy.

The MUFG Group Personal Information Protection Policy applies to all MUFG Group operations that handle
personal information and specified personal information, etc. Any handling of personal information and
specified personal information, etc., that is outsourced to an external contractor is done so under a contract,
etc., based on the MUFG Group Personal Information Protection Policy.

MUFG Group has incorporated the MUFG Group Personal Information Protection Policy into the compliance
management of each Group company and clarified various safety control measures and management
methods related to personal information, as well as corrective measures in the event of an information
leakage, etc.

The MUFG Global Compliance Division, as the department responsible for the management of personal
information protection at MUFG Group, handles the integrated management of personal information protection
within MUFG Group.

Based on the MUFG Group Personal Information Protection Policy, each Group company has established
regulations for the protection and management of personal information, and has designated people and
departments in charge, their roles, etc., to integrate the management of personal information protection.

The department that oversees the management of personal information protection at each Group company is

responsible for the integrated management of personal information protection, including the consolidation of

internal regulations, reporting to the Board of Directors, etc. In addition to developing a system for the

protection of personal information, the department provides guidance to relevant departments and provides

training, etc., to ensure that customers' personal information and specified personal information, etc., is

handled appropriately. Training sessions for all executives and employees (including contract/temporary

employees) are held regularly as part of efforts to enhance our personal information protection management

system.

At MUFG Group, we conduct internal audits to ensure appropriate management of personal information

The Sustainability Report is a P DF version of Mitsubishi U FJ Financial G roup’ s MU FG website Sustainability to provide stakeholders with a summary of MU FG s sustainability initiatives.

This report and website are designed ing a to provide stakeholders with a better understanding of MU FG sustainable environment and society and sustainable growth.

W e also aim to continuously expand our information disclosure.

Mitsubishi U FJ Morgan Stanley Securities C o., L td.

We believe that empowering members of society to effectively confront environmental and social issues is an integral part of our mission as a financial institution.

The ongoing trend toward decarbonization is expected to result in major changes in global industrial structure which, in turn, will position MUFG and its customers to address risks affecting their business continuity as well as seize opportunities for growth.

Aiming to realize smooth transition to a decarbonized society and creating a sustainable society by fostering a virtuous cycle between the environment and economy, we have been promoting our climate change related initiatives at a robust pace since announcing the MUFG Carbon Neutrality Declaration in May 2021.

In April 2022, we published the MUFG Progress Report and announced interim targets to achieve net zero greenhouse gas GHG emissions from our financed portfolio in the power and oil gas sectors.

In June, all MUFG companies in Japan shifted contracted electricity to 100% renewable energy.

To realize carbon neutrality, it is important not only to achieve net zero GHG emissions in our own operations but also support the decarbonization efforts of our customers.

Thus far, MUFG has furthered customer engagement with about 550 companies in Japan and overseas to identify the challenges and needs of each customer.

Through these engagement efforts, we have simultaneously been reinforcing a diverse range of services to respond to identified needs, such as helping calculate their GHG emissions and TCFD disclosure consulting services.

In September, we drafted the MUFG Transition White Paper to bundle extensive information about decarbonization initiatives at Japanese companies, the environment surrounding energy policy in Japan, and other such topics, in addition to engaging in an exchange of ideas with policymakers overseas.

By genuinely supporting customers tackle their challenges, I hope MUFG can drive decarbonization efforts together.

As a leading global company, MUFG engages and plays our part in international initiatives that meet pressing issues head on.

The Net Zero Banking Alliance NZBA is one such initiative in which we are committed to communicating our views as an Asian representative in the Steering Group.

We are also a member of its six working groups and chair of one, where we are directly involved in developing an international framework for transition financing.

MUFG will continue to contribute to decarbonization initiatives globally through engaging with clients, supporting technological advances that promote decarbonization, establishing rules, commercialization, market creation, and many other such measures.

Set a Target to Reduce th e Balance of Corporate Finance f or Coal Fired P ow er Generation I n addition to pursuing our conventional reduction target for the credit balance targets for coal fired power generation proj ects, we have set a target to reduce the balance of corporate finance for coal fired power generation.

P eriodic reviews of the policy framework in response to changes in business activities and the business environment to materializ e environmental and social considerations.

The Job C hallenge program offers opportunities for each applicant to take on tasks within the G roup in a way that aligns with their desires regardless of the entity they belong to.

Dow Jones and CDP) is determined on an absolute evaluation basis, with the aim of objectively assessing the recipient’s contribution to MUFG’s initiatives to address ESG issues in a variety of fields.

ESG related assessment items subject to qualitative evaluation include contribution to the resolution of environmental and social concerns, the promotion of inclusion diversity and the strengthening and upgrading of MUFG’s governance structure.

The TCFD recommendations propose that climate change related risks and opportunities be disclosed upon grasping impacts on business strategy and f inances.

Under the MUFG Way, which guides all of our activities, MUFG has established the MUFG Environmental Policy Statement as a specific action guideline for practicing environmental considerations.

The MUFG Environmental Policy Statement has been the matter to be determined in the Board of Directors since May 2021.

The Policy Statement clearly states the company's commitment to proactively disclose information on the environment, including climate change.

In April 2021, we defined our purpose as being Committed to empowering a brighter future.

Since then, we have been implementing our medium term business plan, led by a heightened commitment to helping resolve environmental and social issues.

To better contribute to building a sustainable environment and society, MUFG has selected 10 priority environmental and social issues with an eye on better fulfilling society’s expectations in areas where MUFG’s strengths can be applied.

One of the priorities we especially focus on is climate change measures and environmental protection.

We have always been proactive in addressing climate change and environmental protection issues.

It included formulating the MUFG Environmental and Social Policy Framework for assessing and managing the risks associated with our business activities as well as setting sustainable finance targets.

Japanese government’s Carbon Neutrality Declaration.

In the MUFG Progress Report issued in April 2022, we reported on the progress of MUFG's carbon neutrality initiatives and the measures that we are taking.

In addition to the results and targets, we also reported on our approach to achieving them and our thought process on which they are based.

MUFG s initiatives in detail, we hope to work together with wide range of stakeholders to achieve a sustainable environment and society.

MUFG joined NZBA in June 2021 after announcing the Carbon Neutrality Declaration.

NZBA members share a common goal: net zero financed portfolios by 2050.

They are also required to set interim targets for 2030 or earlier using a science based approach.

We are committed to helping achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement by achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and at the same time, supporting a smooth transition to a decarbonized society through our financial services, and proactively contributing to creating a sustainable society by fostering a virtuous cycle between the environment and the economy.

Today, we have set interim targets for 2030, aligned with the Paris Agreement.

We recognize that the processes for achieving these targets vary depending on the characteristics of each region and business.

We are also aware that our business is greatly affected by geopolitical risks and other factors, so we will share issues that we find through engagement (dialogue) with customers and support them to help resolve these issues.

Innovations which are still in the conceptual stage is another indispensable element for the world to achieve decarbonization.

We believe that there is a gap between the real world and the goal that is yet to be materialized.

Therefore, our aspiration is to further contribute to the changes where the world advances more towards decarbonization by developing research on new technologies for implementation.

To reflect our stance mentioned above, we have set ranged interim targets in order to work together with our stakeholders to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050.

Net zero GHG emissions from the financed portfolio means decarbonizing the sector portfolio by reducing the GHG (Scope3) generated through financing customers and projects.

GHG emissions from the financed portfolio are defined as financed emissions .

This is the amount of GHG emissions attributed to each financial institution through financing each customer or project.

MUFG uses the calculation model recommended by the PCAF.

MUFG uses outstanding credit amount which includes the undrawn amount of commitment in order to reflect our credit stance as a financial institution more accurately.

We have adopted the following four approaches to setting the interim target.

Going forward, we will reflect the changes in the IEA (International Energy Agency) scenario and various guidelines, as well as the increase in the quality of data disclosed by our customers, as appropriate.

As a benchmark for 1.5 C, we will refer to scientific scenarios published by IEA and others.

When data is updated or new data is disclosed, improvements in accuracy and quality will be reflected.

MUFG will also contribute to improving data accuracy by being highly transparent when disclosing information.

MUFG believes that targets should be set from a global perspective using widely accepted and transparent methods.

We participate in various initiatives, collecting insights and reflecting them in the targets we set.

As a benchmark for 1.5 C, we will refer to scientific scenarios published by IEA and others.

However, there are limits to the amount and quality of data currently available, so we will use the PCAF data quality score to check the quality of emissions data disclosed by MUFG.

When data is updated or new data is disclosed, improvements in accuracy and quality will be reflected.

MUFG will also contribute to improving data accuracy by being highly transparent when disclosing information.

MUFG believes that targets should be set from a global perspective using widely accepted and transparent methods.

We participate in various initiatives, collecting insights and reflecting them in the targets we set.

We will proceed with target setting, incorporating guidelines and rules developed by NZBA, PCAF, PACTA, and SBTi etc., as well as the outcomes of the global working groups which we participate in.

Pathways and the methods to achieve carbon neutrality vary by sector, so for each sector we will take into consideration the characteristics of the business, the guidelines and the targets set by each customer.

By taking this approach, MUFG will identify issues in each sector and support customers’ efforts for achieving carbon neutrality.

Sector analysis, (3) Determine methodologies and measure GHG emissions, and (4) Set interim targets.

The NZBA Guidelines define nine carbon intensive sectors that should be prioritized when setting targets: agriculture aluminium cement coal commercial residential real estate iron steel oil gas power generation and transport.

Among these sectors, MUFG especially puts priority on the power and the oil gas sectors for the following reasons.

CO emissions from the power sector account for approximately 40% of global CO emissions.

CO emissions from fuels and therefore important for reducing GHG emissions from fossil fuels.

Both sectors have relatively large financed emissions in the MUFG portfolio.

Both sectors have relatively well developed data and methodologies.

In the transition stage to a decarbonized society, the demand for power is expected to increase due to economic growth in developing countries and the electrification of industry.

The policies and initiatives of each country are important because the business model of this sector is local and therefore has particularly strong regional characteristics.

Electricity demand under the IEA 1.5 C scenario (IEA NZE scenario in which the increase in the global surface temperature rise is limited to 1.5 C with a 50% or greater probability of success) is estimated to grow by 39% by 2030 and 166% by 2050 (compared with 2020).

Among these sectors, MUFG especially puts priority on the power and the oil gas sectors for the following reasons.

CO emissions from the power sector account for approximately 40% of global CO emissions.

Oil gas are widely consumed by industry and households, accounting for approximately 50% of global CO emissions from fuels and therefore important for reducing GHG emissions from fossil fuels.

Both sectors have relatively large financed emissions in the MUFG portfolio.

Both sectors have relatively well developed data and methodologies.

In the transition stage to a decarbonized society, the demand for power is expected to increase due to economic growth in developing countries and the electrification of industry.

So, the power sector will need to shift to renewable energy and low carbon fuels, while ensuring a stable supply of energy The policies and initiatives of each country are important because the business model of this sector is local and therefore has particularly strong regional characteristics.

Electricity demand under the IEA 1.5 C scenario (IEA NZE scenario in which the increase in the global surface temperature rise is limited to 1.5 C with a 50% or greater probability of success) is estimated to grow by 39% by 2030 and 166% by 2050 (compared with 2020).

On the other hand, a large amount of this sector’s GHG emissions is due to cross industrial consumption (Scope 3), indicating that decarbonization in the oil gas sector cannot be achieved without industries and households transitioning away from fossil fuels.

The IEA figures suggest that currently there is a large gap between the demand (IEA APS scenario that is based on the commitments announced by each country) and the 1.5 C scenario.

It is important to promote decarbonization in the demand sectors as well in order to close the gap between these two scenarios.

Following SBTi and PACTA, the value chain and emission scope which we cover is Scope1 of the power generation business, which accounts for the majority of GHG emissions in this sector.

The power sector is expected to take a leading role in driving cross industry decarbonization.

GHG emission intensity, a measure of emission efficiency, will be used as the metric because the power sector needs to support the increasing electricity demand while simultaneously moving ahead with clean energy conversion.

The average PCAF score for the target portfolio that is included in the calculation is 2.4.

In addition to information disclosed by customers, we use data sources, including CDP and Bloomberg, etc.

In cases where GHG emission data is not available, we use production data obtained from these data sources as well as emission intensity information obtained from IEA database, etc.

Customers who do 75 not have GHG emission data or production data are excluded from the calculation, yet we manage to cover more than 85% of our credit portfolio for this sector.

Going forward, we will expand our target coverage and improve data quality reflected in our PCAF score in line with enhanced data availability.

The power sector has a local business model with strong regional characteristics, and is expected to take a leading role in promoting each NDC with governments.

In addition to the above, we aim for 156gCO e(cid:18)(cid:78)(cid:58)h(cid:15) which is consistent with the IEA 1.5 C scenario in 2030(cid:15) b(cid:92) making further contributions to the promotion of renewable energy, etc.

According to PACTA, upstream businesses of fossil fuel sectors are important as they have significant impact on other segments down the value chain.

Therefore MUFG focuses on the upstream of the value chain, which have the largest environmental impact.

The emission scope which we look into covers not only Scope1 and Scope2 but also Scope3, from which the majority of GHG emissions from this sector is generated.

The average PCAF score for the target portfolio that is included in the calculation is 2.6.

The interim target for 2030 is 15% 28% reduction from 2019.

We will achieve 15% reduction by engaging with our customers and supporting their efforts in reducing GHG emissions. 15% reduction is a level well below the IEA 2 C scenario in 2030.

We aim for 28% reduction which is consistent with the IEA 1.5 C scenario in 2030.

However, to achieve this it is essential for both the oil gas sector (supply side) and the industries (demand side) to simultaneously accelerate decarbonization.

Therefore, we intend to achieve 28% reduction by making contribution to the world to further advance toward decarbonization.

Neutrality Declaration in May 2021, MUFG has reduced approximately 60% of domestic GHG emissions (which is approximately 30% of global GHG emissions).

In addition to our initiatives to reduce energy use through continued energy conservation, we will reduce our gasoline consumption by switching to electric vehicles (EVs) and promote the use of renewable energy sources for electricity to become net zero for GHG emissions by 2030.

Overseas, while accumulating expertise from promoting domestic environmental initiatives and introducing renewable energy at our European business locations, we will accelerate implementing specific measures, taking into account the status of policies and systems to promote decarbonization in each country.

Green power, generated from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and biomass (biological resources), is sent directly from the power plant to the consumer.

Customers can use green power directly as electricity for their own use, rather than deemed to do so.

To achieve net zero GHG emissions in our own operations by 2030, MUFG has measured and aggregated its own GHG emissions on a group and global basis since FY 2020.

In FY 2021, the Bank obtained third party verification for its own GHG emissions in Japan (non consolidated basis).

By November 2021, the Bank, the Trust Bank, and the Securities completed switching to 100% renewable energy for their own domestic electricity contracts.

Since the release of the MUFG Carbon Neutrality Declaration in May 2021, we have reduced domestic emissions by approximately 60% (approximately 30% of global emissions).

In June 2022, NICOS and ACOM also completed switching to 100% renewable electricity.

As a result, we were able achieve 100% renewable electricity among all of MUFG's consolidated subsidiaries in Japan for their own contracted electricity, ahead of our initial schedule.

MUFG has entered a long term PPA contract to purchase electricity from solar power generation facilities 79 established by other companies and implemented self consignment, whereby MUFG installs its own solar power generation facilities and consumes the electricity produced.

Through these efforts, we have introduced what is referred to as raw green power for a portion of the electricity used at our business locations and data centers.

At the same time, MUFG itself is involved in the construction of new power generation facilities and purchases renewable power generated from these under long term contracts, which allows MUFG to directly contributes to the increase in the number of renewable power sources, which can be extended to across Japan.

In Japan, we are aiming to switch to 100% EVs by FY 2030.

For this, we have developed detailed plans that take into account the expiration of existing car lease contracts and the surrounding EV charging environment.

We have implemented a GHG emissions management platform at approximately 2,400 of our consolidated subsidiaries in more than 50 countries and regions around the world.

With its ESG strategy as a pillar of its management strategy, Japan Airlines aims to contribute to the realization of a Status of Implementation sustainable society by addressing social issues through its business.

MUFG has been in continuous discussion with Japan Airlines and supported its bond issuance by developing a framework in accordance with the Green Bond Principles of the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) and by providing support for obtaining a second party opinion in order to promote the company's ESG strategy through its fund raising.

The purpose of the bond issuance is to diversify financing methods as the world’s first transition bond in the aviation industry and to accelerate efforts toward net zero emissions by 2050 by allocating funds to investments, such as cutting edge, fuel efficient aircraft, which contributes to CO emission reduction.

Going forward, MUFG will continue to help enhance Japan Airline’s commitment to ESG management by supporting the issuance of bonds and continue working with the company to support its ongoing efforts and new challenges toward the transition to a decarbonized society.

MUFG coordinates dialogues between customers in the power sector and overseas institutional investors.

As a financial institution, we encourage customers and investors to close the gap in their perceptions of their position, particularly the ideals and the reality of becoming carbon neutral.

Most recently, we exchanged views on respective approaches to transitioning and contributed to building a foundation for formulating strategies.

MUFG, including top management, regularly exchanges opinions with customers in the power sector regarding the external environment and awareness of problems, and we are working to gain a more multifaceted understanding of the position of customers through tours of power generation plants.

To achieve the common goal of carbon neutrality for both customers and MUFG, we will discuss how MUFG can best contribute to the formulation and implementation of customers’ strategies, including the possibility of strategic investments and contributing human capital.

MUFG supports its customers in the oil and gas sector by working as one solid group to formulate strategies to implement transitions for each company, such as the introduction of hydrogen, ammonia, and biomass.

In addition, by participating in discussions with local governments and various councils, we will deepen our understanding of business conditions in the sector and support the promotion of individual projects, such as initiatives for decarbonization of industrial complexes.

MUFG uses a wide range of engagement activities with customers in the oil gas sector to help them achieve transitions, including exchanging opinions on the future of the industry as well as providing opportunities to discuss developments in new areas, such as forest management.

From FY 2021, the risks related to climate change have been newly added to the Risk Appetite Statement.

We aim to establish, maintain, and further develop a framework for appropriately managing risks related to climate change.

The Risk Appetite Framework is a framework for clarifying the risk appetite (the type and amount of risk to be undertaken) to achieve MUFG's business strategy and financial plan and for conducting business management and risk management.

In the Top Risk Management approach that MUFG primarily adopts for enterprise risk management, we consider the risks arising from climate change as one of the Top Risks.

We also recognize that climate change related risks are likely to become apparent and worsen in the medium to long term.

In MUFG and its core subsidiaries, management is regularly engaged in discussions regarding the Top Risks to gain a further understanding of the risk recognition, and to develop appropriate risk control countermeasures.

MUFG de fines a risk event as a loss that could be brought on to the Group as a result of the materialization of various risk scenarios and determines the importance level based on the impact and probability of the event.

As we promote smart workstyles and push ahead with the digital shift to enhance operational efficiency and improve productivity, we are redirecting our human resources toward high value added operations with the aim of empowering them to achieve higher performance as professionals.

For MUFG's sustainable growth, securing highly professional human resources in a variety of f ields of specialization is important.

For this purpose, MUFG is endeavoring to secure and nurture true professionals with advanced skills and expertise, through comprehensive efforts in recruitment and training.

Each Group company is actively engaged in developing human resources through various programs and on the job training.

However, when entering into and developing new business, human resources with expertise in new fields that cannot be handled by existing employees are required.

In order to acquire the necessary human resources, we are promoting midcareer recruitment.

Furthermore, as integrated management of the MUFG companies progresses, it is becoming increasingly important to have business areas where the MUFG Companies work together along with human resources who can demonstrate their abilities across the MUFG companies regardless of the company they belong to.

Under this situation, the MUFG Direct Employment System, a framework in which the holding company, MUFG, directly hires employees, was started in April 2019.

The purpose of this system is to encourage employees with high skills and a wealth of experience to further demonstrate their abilities.

In FY2021, we held MUFG Way Integration Sessions with the objective of encouraging employees to discover how relevant the MUFG Way is to their day to day tasks and actions.

Each session began with self reflection, with attendees asked to consider their value systems, beliefs and aspirations so that they may better articulate them as My Way.

They were then asked to develop their own interpretations of the MUFG Way in light of the policies upheld by the respective branch and division they belong to, and missions currently assigned to them.

These interpretations were shared among attendees, who usually came from the same workplace, and they engaged in free discussions on that basis.

In addition, a cascade down approach was used in these sessions, with Group CEO Kamezawa becoming the first to share his personal definition of the MUFG Way with officers overseeing Group companies.

This sharing of My Way then progressed from officers to general managers of branches and divisions, and from general managers to their staff.

The number of sessions held in Japan and overseas thus exceeded 3,000 and involved more than 50,000 employees.

Comments voiced by participants included, I began to feel a sense of intimacy after hearing the personal life stories of my supervisor and what he she really thinks about his her job, things that I would never have known and The session helped me to recall what I was aiming for when I had just joined the Company.

It was a good opportunity to seriously think about how I envision my contribution to customers and society as a whole.

On the other hand, some participants commented that It is hard to translate the Purpose into my tasks.

Therefore, it can be concluded that we are only halfway to our goal of empowering employees to develop a robust sense of ownership about the Purpose.

In FY2022, we updated these sessions into MUFG Way Employee Sessions, focusing on helping attendees reexamine the relationship between My Way and the MUFG Way and develop tangible definitions of the stakeholders they aim to serve and how they will contribute to such stakeholders through their duties at MUFG.

We thus are encouraging all employees, including those who are in non managerial positions, to frankly exchange their thoughts on these matters with their supervisors, team members and other colleagues.

Head of Global HR interviewed regional leaders of Inclusion Diversity about the necessity of a global strategy, initiatives and Equity in each region, and future direction.

Initially, our main objective was to improve the job satisfaction of female employees, However, since 2010, we have expanded the scope of our initiatives with the aim of improving the job satisfaction of not only female employees but also diverse employees.

Moving forward, we will further focus our efforts on creating workplaces where all employees of the Group can demonstrate their unique strengths and make diversity empower a brighter future.

MUFG focuses on Inclusion and Diversity (I D) as one of its key strategies, which is one of the 10 Priority Issues in MUFG’s Sustainability Management.

Head of Global HR interviewed regional I D leaders.

Okeatta: When I joined MUFG in 2021, I learned there were several meaningful engagements in process in the Americas, including the launch of an Executive I D Council made up of our CEO, CHRO, and leaders from our Enterprise Resource Groups (ERG) and Business Unit I D Councils, and CSR resulting in several initiatives designed to impact change.

However, there seemed to be a lack of clear goals and objectives aligned to a north star, an I D vision.

The opportunity surfaced to build an enterprise I D strategy that includes success measures that were impactful enough to shift behaviours, which are necessary to transform a culture and effect change internally and externally.

We must invest in I D as a business imperative and a competitive advantage.

Jennifer: EMEA has a clear commitment to I D through our EMEA strategy with strengthening our culture set out as a core pillar.

Our EMEA Employee Network programme is one of many critical components of this and consists of seven resource networks that help us to establish a working environment that embraces and celebrates the diversity of our people.

These networks offer our employees community, connection and a sense of belonging, all of which help to increase and maintain employee engagement.

However, our approach remains very regional and reactive.

From my perspective, the obvious next step for MUFG is a global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) strategy.

Kiat: I’ve been with the bank for just over 4 years and in this rather short time, I can see I D and cultural transformation has been changed in MUFG, particularly in APAC.

Employees currently in the organization could also see this as an opportunity to progress with their career especially in regions countries where DEI has been neglected for a while.

The world is rapidly changing and more and more issues around I D are being surfaced daily.

Now that DEI is high on everyone’s agenda, we can better manage this situation by framing the priorities for the teams working on it.

Sayaka: In Singapore where I worked until the beginning of 2021, our colleagues have various nationalities, cultures, careers, and all are very diversified.

After I came back to Tokyo, I again realized that there is a huge gap between Japan and overseas offices.

In Japan, it is homogeneous where most employees in Head Office are Japanese, important roles are assigned to men, etc.

I strongly believe diverse talent will enable us to tackle diverse issues talent, that can leverage their skills through an effective network and courageous communication with colleagues.

Angus: We want to create a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment which fosters all talents for the better of MUFG focusing on diversity of thought, inputs and experience, equity of treatment in all we do and creating an environment that is inclusive for all where all can thrive.

Sayaka: In Japan, one of our top priorities is to solve the gender gap.

We have increased the target % representation of female management in Japan from 18% to 20% by fiscal 2023, but it is still on the way to reach to 30% set out by government.

We are supporting education of women by providing various learning and development programs and mentoring programs, in collaboration with Business Units, etc.

In addition, we are focused on increasing mid career hiring of SMEs (Subject Matter Experts), leadership assignments to locally hired staff and stable employment of people with disabilities and LGBTQ colleagues, moving forward to cultivate an inclusive corporate culture.

Globally, Equity will be introduced to shift to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.

This is not equality in which we provide the same things to various people, but equity where we provide appropriate support to each individual.

I think equity is critical when solving for closing the gap for gender, people with disabilities and SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity), etc.

Kiat: MUFG APAC is a diverse region, 18 different countries, many cultures, languages, and differing legislations impacting each of our respective locations.

Therefore, we seek to become as inclusive as possible through our diversities of gender or races etc.

We are doing this by ensuring we have the right mix of gender diversification at all levels in global, regional and local projects.

Another practical approach, for example: we are setting up diverse employee teams, bringing together all levels, and a wide representation of staff, to give them a voice for continuous improvement and to enable their contribution to business decisions.

Additionally, we have partner banks in the region, and this adds a level of energy and enthusiasm to how we work together and leverage the diversity that they also bring to MUFG APAC.

Jennifer: In EMEA, fostering a culture of collaboration, inclusivity, diversity, empowerment, and high performance is one of the four pillars of our EMEA strategy.

Firstly, we focus on increasing diverse representation in line with the commitments we have made to the Women in Finance Charter and Race at Work Charter.

We link accountability for achieving approved targets to executive performance through our EMEA Leadership objective, by monitoring and reporting on key diversity metrics.

We also implement initiatives to support the learning, development and progression of diverse talent through initiatives such as our Reverse Mentoring programme.

Okeatta: In the Americas, we were able to develop a comprehensive DEI strategy with key performance indicators that include a focus on increasing gender, race, and ethnicity representation at senior levels, DEI learning and leadership development programs, and a plan for building an inclusive culture.

We will use the remainder of the calendar year to operationalize our enterprise DEI strategy to include: 1) enhancing our governance model to leverage a top down and bottom up approach, 2) strengthen accountability at our most senior levels and for all people managers by introducing specific DEI management objectives starting in fiscal 2022, 3) investing in a comprehensive DEI learning and development platform and so on.

Sayaka: We must solve the situation where employees cannot fully utilise their ability due to their identity and environment.

Additional investment in these employees will help to draw on their capabilities and have a positive impact on others, which will facilitate a merit based system, or culture of pay for performance, ensuring that the right person is in the right role.

This will make individuals and our organization resilient, which is a target of pursuing equity.

Each region has different issues, so actions are diversified.

However, our global goal is to ensure equitable opportunities for all employees so they may maximize their capability within an inclusive culture and with psychological safety.

Angus: You are fostering global collaboration in addition to regional focus.

Okeatta: We are working to define a global north star and set clear objectives and key performance indicators to track and measure year over year progress of our journey to becoming the most trusted financial group.

Jennifer: I’m excited about the progress we’re making towards building an integrated global DEI strategy.

In EMEA, we’ve focused on I D until now but recognise the importance of including equity.

This change will allow us to take a more global approach in reviewing the policies, practices and processes that impact our employees, ensuring that someone’s identity bears no impact on their ability to achieve their full potential and ambitions at MUFG.

Okeatta: The DEI strategy for the Americas includes a focus on workforce, culture, marketplace, and community.

We must ask ourselves if we are being inclusive when we consider the products and services we offer and procure.

A community focus is also integral to our DEI strategy.

Supporting organizations and strategic collaborations dedicated to social justice, racial equity, gender equity, culture, arts, and economic prosperity within underserved communities through investment, volunteering, and charitable donations demonstrates our commitment to ESG.

Sayaka: I believe that by leveraging our global and regional network, we can lead the discussion with our customers and clients addressing social issues.

This will not only change corporate culture, but also connect to our MUFG Purpose Committed to empowering a bright future.

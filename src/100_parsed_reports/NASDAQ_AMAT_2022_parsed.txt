Message from Our CEO

Semiconductors are foundational to the technologies that play an 
ever-increasing role in our lives, transforming the global economy and 
enabling discoveries to help address some of humankind’s greatest 
challenges. Applied Materials is committed to working across the 
semiconductor ecosystem to drive advances that can enable a better 
future for everyone.

The technologies that power our world—
the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and 
artificial intelligence (AI)—are evolving at 
an unprecedented rate. Exponential growth 
in data generation is driving the need for 
dramatic improvements in the power, 
performance, area, cost and time to market 
(PPACt) of next-generation semiconductor 
devices. As the PPACt Enablement Company™, 
Applied is collaborating broadly to accelerate 
our customers’ technology roadmaps. 

Our broad and deep capabilities encompass 
the ability to create, shape, remove, modify 
and analyze advanced materials at an atomic 
level and on an industrial scale. As we bring 
transformative new innovations to market,  
we are also working closely with our customers 
to minimize our environmental impact by 
reducing our products’ energy, water and 
carbon emissions. For example, our new 
Centura® Sculpta® patterning system can 
reduce per-wafer manufacturing costs, water 
use and carbon emissions compared to 
existing processes. 

This kind of innovation not only drives PPACt 
for our customers, it also encourages a more 
sustainable innovation model throughout our 
industry. This is the fundamental principle 

of our 1X/100X/10,000X framework, which 
reflects the impacts of environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) efforts within 
our operations, with our suppliers and 
customers, and on the global electronics 
ecosystem. We are committed to minimizing 
our own operational impact (1X), reducing 
the environmental impact of our value chain 
through our Supply Chain Certification for 
Environmental and Social Sustainability 
(SuCCESS2030) roadmap and 3x30 product 
improvements (100X), and accelerating 
the commercialization of next-generation 
semiconductors (10,000X).

As you’ll read in this 2022 Sustainability 
Report, Applied Materials is driving an 
aggressive 10-year ESG roadmap while 
managing record-setting business growth, 
supply chain challenges, ongoing pandemic-
related restrictions, and a changing 
macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape.

diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) targets 
and took steps to instill DEI best practices 
across the company. We continue to invest in 
building a diverse and inclusive talent pipeline, 
and in Applied’s fiscal 2022 played an active 
leadership role in advocating for the successful 
passage of the U.S. Respect for Marriage Act. 
These types of actions ensure inclusion remains 
at the center of our culture and better position 
us to scale our global operations in the future.

In the U.S., Applied advocated for passage of 
the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides 
a catalyst for the industry to accelerate 
investments to build more robust supply 
chains, speed up innovation and create 
thousands of new jobs. Our Chief Technology 
Officer, Om Nalamasu, serves on the 
Industrial Advisory Committee of CHIPS 
for America, giving us a seat at the table 
to promote fair, equitable and sustainable 
implementation of this policy. 

Over the past year, we further strengthened our 
commitment to attract and retain the best talent 
and cultivate a Culture of Inclusion (COI). We 
made progress against our goals to increase the 
representation of women at Applied globally 
and underrepresented minorities (URMs) in 
our U.S. workforce. We also set new 2030 

We reached a key milestone in our transition 
to a low-carbon future by achieving 100% 
renewable electricity in our U.S. operations 
and 69% globally. We set a science-based 
Scope 3 carbon emissions reduction goal, 
which awaits validation from the Science 
Based Targets initiative.

Even as we celebrate this progress, we 
challenge ourselves to do more and do it faster. 
As a result of business growth, our Scope 1, 
2 and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
increased 17% over the course of last year. 
While the intensity of those emissions declined 
due to our 3x30 product efficiency program, 
we have redoubled our efforts to decouple 
business growth from emissions.

As I reflect on recent history, I am more 
convinced than ever that there is no 
industry better positioned than ours to lead 
the transition to a more sustainable and 
inclusive future. I am inspired by the passion, 
commitment and solutions-driven mindset 
of our employees, customers and partners. 
Together, we’ve shown that challenges create 
opportunities for radical innovation. This is 
how we Make Possible a Better Future.

Reduce equivalent energy consumption 
per wafer for semiconductor products by 
30% by 2030 from 2019 baseline

Average per-wafer energy use decreased ahead of schedule, in part due to changes in the mix of 
products sold. While we expect the reduction rate to slow, we are on track to meet or exceed the 
3x30 target.

Reduce the impact from chemical 
consumption per wafer for 
semiconductor products by 30% by 
2030 from 2019 baseline

30% reduction in tool footprint per 
production unit ratio (sqm/wph) for 
semiconductor products from 2019 
baseline

$1 billion spend with (and representation 
of) women- and minority-owned 
businesses by 2027

The Design for Sustainability Center of Excellence (DfSu) team and its engineering partners in the 
product business units are pursuing multiple development projects that will significantly reduce 
chemical impact. Some of these initiatives are expected to be multi-year efforts, but we are on 
track to meet or exceed the 3x30 target.

Footprint reduction to date is largely the result of productivity improvements in existing tool 
architectures. As new product architectures begin volume shipments to customers, the footprint 
will be further reduced and is expected to meet or exceed the 3x30 target.

$462 million spent with certified diverse suppliers in 2022, representing 2.5% of total global

We conduct regular corporate responsibility materiality 
assessments to help us identify the ESG issues most important 
to our stakeholders and determine where we may achieve the 
most significant progress to Make Possible a Better Future. 
Insights for the assessment are gathered from key stakeholders, 
including customers, investors, employees, suppliers, policy 
makers, regulators, media, industry groups and peers.

In 2021, Applied updated its materiality assessment using the 
Datamaran platform. We repeated this assessment in 2022 
to revalidate our focus on the most relevant ESG issues. The 
2022 materiality assessment revealed no significant changes 
in ESG issues or prioritization mapping compared with 2021. 
However, we did see minor shifts in issue prioritization year-over-
year when viewed through a double-materiality lens. Double 
materiality assesses the ESG factors likely to affect our business 
(e.g., financial impacts), as well as factors that our activities may 
affect, both positively and negatively. 

The following issues rose slightly on the double-materiality 
assessment and align with priority areas of focus at Applied: 

• Energy management

• Employee health and safety

• Climate change and GHG emissions

This report discusses all issues identified 
as critical in the materiality matrix. Since 
issue prioritization may shift based on 
changing strategic impact for Applied 
and our stakeholders, we will continue 
conducting new materiality assessments 
on an a biannual cadence.

with our corporate strategy. The company’s annual strategic review process with our CEO and his executive 
team includes ESG. Our Corporate Scorecard includes a measure of work towards our corporate 2030 ESG 
goals, and the executive team reviews progress quarterly. Demonstrated progress against ESG goals affects 
compensation for Applied’s executives, up to and including our CEO. 

For Applied’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, Certificate 
of Incorporation, Bylaws, Board committee charters, and 
other governance framework materials, see our Investor 
Relations site. Information on Board and corporate 
governance policies and practices can also be found in our 
2023 Proxy Statement.

Our ESG Leadership Council oversees the implementation of our strategy, with membership encompassing 
leaders from across our ESG-focused delivery teams. To ensure accountability, the Council reports progress 
regularly to the executive team as part of our strategic review process and reports quarterly to the Corporate 
Governance and Nominating Committee (CGNC). The Council is also responsible for reviewing all content in 
this annual Sustainability Report. The Council is supported by employees and leaders spanning our business 
units and functions, which are responsible for delivering progress toward our ESG strategy.

Sustainability Report 2022Ethics and Compliance

At Applied Materials, we attract talented, innovative individuals  
who conduct business with integrity, transparency, accountability  
and inclusion.

Every day, our teams navigate complex 
situations that may impact our business, 
our employees and our communities. These 
challenges present every Applied employee 
with the opportunity—and obligation—to 
embrace our core values, demonstrate ethical 
decision-making, and ensure that we remain 
a company that competes fairly and cares 
about its people and communities. In this way, 
we continually reinvest in each other and our 
brand, protecting Applied’s good reputation 
and building toward greater success.

To continually reinforce integrity across our 
culture, Applied maintains a Global Ethics 
and Compliance (E&C) program with strong 
leadership and engagement from senior 
management. Our Board’s Audit Committee 
oversees the program’s overall design and 
implementation, including mechanisms for 
reporting potential violations of law or policy 
and investigating potential integrity violations. 
The Audit Committee receives quarterly 
reports on key initiatives and indicators across 
the seven pillars of Applied’s Global E&C 

program (see graphic on page 15), including 
volume and type of open investigations, risk 
level, geography, and remedial actions taken, 
along with indicators related to E&C process 
utilization—e.g., volume of gifts, meals, 
entertainment and travel (GMET) requests, 
conflict-of-interest disclosures, corporate 
donations and third-party due diligence 
requests.

We engage our people on E&C through training, 
awareness campaigns, ethics surveys and road 
shows, and through our annual Responsibility 
and Integrity Week. Across our business units, 
over 60 designated Compliance Champions 
promote E&C, IP protection, and mandatory 
training completion, and serve as trusted local 
contacts for employee questions or concerns.

Applied is committed to being a 
good corporate citizen and a trusted 
partner to our customers, suppliers 
and shareholders.

To drive E&C advances in 2022, we:

• Revitalized our Standards of Business 

• Created a cross-functional investigation 

Conduct (SBC) to align more closely with 
our company values. Beginning with our 
August all-employee meeting, our CEO 
and Chief Legal Officer rolled out our new 
SBC, which is available in 14 languages 
and is accompanied by a redesigned  
SBC website. 

• Implemented regional compliance 

committees across our global operations 
to enable local implementation of E&C 
initiatives, provide regional feedback and 
recommendations, and further drive tone 
from the top and our culture of integrity. 
Each committee is comprised of local 
leaders from the Legal and Compliance 
Organization (LCO), Finance, HR, and our 
business units.

• Completed multiple risk assessments 

and audits, including in the areas of gifts 
and entertainment, anti-corruption in 
high-risk geographies, and higher risk 
third-party business partners. 

case management tool across legal 
pillars to allow data sharing, standardized 
reporting, and enhanced productivity  
and execution.

• Created a playbook for acquisitions, 

joint ventures and strategic 
investments, allowing for cross-topical 
risk identification and mitigation as well 
as real-time status monitoring. 

• Developed compliance “health check” 
indicators and metrics for compliance 
risk dashboards, providing quarter-over-
quarter data and trend monitoring across 
compliance business areas.

See our Corporate Governance documents 
for additional details about our Standards 
of Business Conduct and governance 
structures, and our Applied Ethics Helpline 
for mechanisms to report ethics concerns.

Standards of Business Conduct
Applied Materials’ Standards of Business 
Conduct (SBC) communicate our values, set 
expectations for our global workforce and 
network of trusted partners, and promote the 
highest ethical standards in our interactions with 
customers, suppliers, colleagues, communities 
and other stakeholders. We designed the SBC 
to foster trust in management’s commitment 
to our values, empower employees to speak up 
without fear of retaliation, and provide clear 
guidance about risks, laws, company policies and 
reporting channels.

compliance expectations for all employees. To 
promote compliance, we made both the SBC and 
our SBC website significantly more user-friendly: 
shortening the text, adding interactive navigation 
controls, and linking to policies, tools and other 
helpful resources. 

To enable real-time data analytics and insights 
regarding compliance with our SBC, we maintain 
digitized workflows that track GMET approvals, 
conflict-of-interest disclosures, corporate 
donations approval requests and third-party due 
diligence approvals. 

In summer 2022 we released a major 
revitalization of our SBC in 14 languages, 
mapping the contents to Applied’s core values 
and more clearly and succinctly reiterating our 

We are releasing a companion set of updated

Responsible Business  
Alliance Code of Conduct
Applied Materials is a member of the Responsible Business 
Alliance (RBA), the world’s largest industry coalition 
dedicated to social responsibility in global supply chains. 
In 2022, we began work on a Responsible Manufacturing 
Program to better monitor our compliance with the RBA 
Code of Conduct, which provides standards related to labor, 
health and safety, environment, ethics and management 
systems, including responsible minerals sourcing. We also 
set clear expectations for social responsibility in our own 
supply chain, requiring our vendors and suppliers to comply 
with both our own Standards and the RBA Code of Conduct.

In 2022, 98% of Applied’s 33,306 
employees completed our updated 
Standards of Business Conduct course.

Practical Advice and Training
Applied Materials provides all our employees with training 
and reinforcement to support their ongoing obligations 
around ethics and compliance. We assign newly hired 
employees an SBC training and certification course, which 
was refreshed in 2022 to align with our updated standards. 
Like the new standards, the SBC training is offered in 14 
languages, covering our policies on conflicts of interest, 
IP protection, anti-corruption, gifts, insider trading, trade 
compliance, supplier selection and treatment, speaking up 
and non-retaliation. Employees renew their training and 
certification to the Standards annually. 

To meet the demands of specific roles and regions, 
employees may also receive ongoing training on specific 
E&C topics. In 2022, for example, we provided 52 live, 
in-person training sessions on our Global Anti-Corruption 
Policy and GMET Policy.

2022 Ethical Culture and 
Compliance Perception Survey
In 2022, Applied Materials retained a third party to develop 
a survey to evaluate employee perceptions of ethics and 
compliance within our corporate culture. Sent to all Applied 
employees, the survey included 69 questions designed to 
gauge perceptions around eight E&C categories, with additional 
questions on employee expectations and demographics. Results 
were broken down by operating regions, business groups, 
business function and job hierarchy.

The survey achieved a response rate above benchmark, 
with responses revealing improved employee perceptions 
in most areas compared to our 2020 survey and equal or 
more favorable scores in 6 of 8 categories compared to the 
benchmark, as well as very high awareness related to company 
expectations around confidential information and intellectual 
property protection.

The survey revealed opportunities for improvement in several 
areas, including building skills for managing high-pressure 
situations. We are focusing our 2023 Responsibility and 
Integrity Week and related 2023 campaigns on ethical decision-
making when under pressure and are reinforcing our speak-up 
culture through localized content that resonates with Applied’s 
diverse geographic and cultural footprint. 

“ Applied truly gives your work purpose. 
I take great satisfaction in knowing that 
the problems I solve today can help solve 
a much bigger problem for someone in a 
different part of the world.”

Balaji
Austin, Texas

RESPONSIBILITY AND INTEGRITY WEEK

Our annual Responsibility and Integrity Week showcases Applied’s 
values in action, with events designed to raise awareness of key themes, 
resources and best practices. During our 2022 event, 52 E&C-related 
topics were posted to our Inside Compliance social media channel, 
achieving 44,982 views.

Public Policy

Applied Materials participates in efforts to inform policymakers about issues and 
challenges critical to our company, our customers and our customers’ customers, 
typically via meetings, hearings and trade association advocacy efforts. Our general 
policy focus areas include technology regulation, international trade, research and 
development (R&D), human resources and labor, and sustainability. Efforts within 
these areas include advocating for immigration reform that embraces the contributions 
of immigrants to the U.S. economy; advocating for fairness, diversity and inclusion, 
including LGBTQ+ rights; and working on policies, partnerships and R&D incentives  
to develop and advance next-generation technologies.

In 2022, our Government Affairs function engaged both Congress and the Biden 
administration on core provisions of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act:

• U.S. semiconductor funding: We successfully advocated for the CHIPS 
Act that provided $52.7 billion for grants to revitalize the U.S. position 
in semiconductor research, development and manufacturing, including 
workforce development.

• Federal tax credit: We were among a small number of companies 

leading efforts to include and expand the investment tax credit that 
had been removed when CHIPS programs were authorized as part of 
the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act. The tax credit applies to 
qualifying investments in facilities for manufacturing semiconductors or 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

Since passage of the CHIPS Act, Applied has been engaging with the 
administration and Congress to ensure its rollout is implemented fairly 
and equitably across the supply chain. In September 2022, Applied’s Chief 
Technology Officer, Om Nalamasu, was named to the U.S. Commerce 
Department’s new Industrial Advisory Committee, which advises CHIPS for 
America on issues related to domestic semiconductor R&D.

Under provisions of the CHIPS Act, recipients of manufacturing grants must 
demonstrate a commitment to increasing the participation of economically 
disadvantaged individuals in the semiconductor workforce. Applied is currently 
working with global trade association SEMI to create an apprentice program 
where Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturers can train students from 
underrepresented communities. This program will extend our work with the 
Foundation’s Generation Girl initiative, providing a multi-rung pathway from 
early STEM education to college to employment within the industry.

Applied Materials also joined a broad business and stakeholder coalition in 
2022 to push the successful passage of the U.S. Respect for Marriage Act, 
which codifies into U.S. law protections for same-sex and interracial couples. 
Our Government Affairs team worked with our trade associations to garner 
votes for the bill, which ultimately passed both houses of Congress with strong 
bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden on December 
13. In advance of Senate passage, Applied Materials was one of the first 
corporate signatories to a Human Rights Campaign open letter calling on 
Congress to move the legislation, along with more than 170 other companies.

Business and Trade Associations
Applied Materials maintains memberships in various business and 
trade associations that advance issues aligned with our corporate 
strategy and the needs of our company, industry, employees and 
communities. Our membership in a group does not imply that we 
endorse the entirety of that group’s policy positions. 

In 2022, Applied paid approximately $564,000 in trade 
association membership dues, 21% of which were specified 
by the associations as non-deductible lobbying expenditures. 
This total does not include conference or event sponsorships, 
programming activities or similar costs. Applied Materials 
reports on federal lobbying through the Lobbying Disclosure 
Act Database and files periodic reports with federal and state 
agencies, as appropriate. 

Our U.S. Trade, Business and Civic Associations membership  
list can be found here.

Political Contributions

The Applied Materials, Inc. Political Action Committee (AMPAC) contributes 
to federal candidates, political action committees and party committees 
supporting issues of strategic importance to Applied, consistent with all legal 
requirements. Our State Contributions Committee oversees corporate political 
spending to advance those strategic issues at the state and local levels. 

While Applied pays the administrative expenses for AMPAC, the committee 
is funded entirely through voluntary contributions from eligible employees, 
and does not make any contributions using Applied Materials corporate funds. 
AMPAC’s activities are overseen and its contributions reviewed and approved 
by the AMPAC Board of Directors. Contributions are based solely on corporate 
objectives, without regard for the private political preferences of either the 
employees who contribute to AMPAC or individual committee members. 
During 2022, political contributions made by AMPAC totaled $69,500.

Data and IP Security

Applied Materials considers data security one of our top strategic 
priorities. In a threat landscape highlighted by data breaches, rising 
ransomware attacks, and increasing availability of tools for hacking 
and exfiltration, we devote robust resources toward protecting our IP 
and making Applied a safe data choice for our global stakeholders.

Recognizing that cyberattacks long ago moved from being a matter of “if” to “when,” 
we maintain both a robust defense framework and the capacity for rapid detection 
and response. We conduct 24/7 monitoring and daily vulnerability assessments and 
continuously update our mitigation practices to stay ahead of threats. 

Among other efforts, we: 

• Maintain detailed response 

procedures and escalation protocols 

• Employ third parties for external 
threat monitoring, penetration 
testing and phishing exercises 

• Maintain enhanced email security 

controls 

• Provide robust training for our 

employees on recognizing security 
threats to enable compliance with 
applicable data security laws, 
regulations, industry practice and 
internal policies 

• Educate employees on cyber threats, 
with mandatory information security 
and privacy training for all employees 
as part of their new-hire orientation 
and every two years thereafter

• Conduct periodic tests of random user 
populations to determine which users 
are vulnerable to real attacks, and 
reinforce security awareness training 
as needed

• Partner with industry groups, 

government agencies and outside 
experts for information exchange  
and peer benchmarking

• Maintain a cloud audit program  

and other processes to continuously 
review and enhance controls 
associated with our cloud 
environments’ security

• Engage third-party auditors to  
help assure the effectiveness of 
internal controls

• Conduct email campaigns to  

educate suppliers on cyberthreats

Applied Materials has undergone a National 
Institute of Standards of Technology (NIST) 
Cybersecurity Framework assessment and 
currently maintains one of the best BitSight 
security scores among our industry peers. 

Forty-seven of our building locations hold ISO 
27001 certification for information security, 
aligning our data security management systems 
and programs with global best practices. 

Our Chief Information Security Officer 
(CISO) reports quarterly to the Board’s 
Audit Committee on our data and IP security 
programs, cloud audit program, policies, 
controls, key risks and notable incidents. 
Any significant cybersecurity threats 
and incidents are reported to the Audit 
Committee on a real-time basis.

While we have not directly experienced a 
material information security (cybersecurity) 
incident in the past three fiscal years, we 
maintain a cybersecurity risk insurance policy 
as a matter of good practice.

CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS MONTH 2022

Applied Materials focuses on security awareness 
throughout the year. For Cybersecurity Awareness 
Month in October, we offered additional live and 
on-demand programming that included:

•  A session with a former FBI cybersecurity 
specialist on the evolving threat landscape

•  Sessions on supply chain, cloud, software and 

engineering applications security

•  A discussion of the latest authentication 

technologies

•  Tips for personal security, email security  

and administrator best practices

Supply Chain Cybersecurity
With the semiconductor industry playing such a visible 
role in current geopolitics, companies in the industry find 
themselves under attack. In 2022, eight semiconductor 
companies were targeted for exfiltration of IP and other 
confidential information, while twelve of our suppliers 
experienced ransomware incidents.

To minimize the risk of IP leakage and business disruption 
caused by attack vectors in our supply chain, our data 
security efforts extend to our suppliers via:

• Enhanced security controls embedded in the supplier 

onboarding process

• Protocols for assessing supply chain cyber-breaches  

and ransomware incidents

• An incident management and business continuity playbook

• Tools to monitor for threats in the dark web and identify 

emerging risks

• Continuous assessment and control enhancement for  

high-impact suppliers

Our Supply Chain Cybersecurity Program is sponsored by 
our supply chain head and CISO and managed by a cross-
functional team encompassing our Global Supply Chain 
operation, Applied Global Services (AGS) Commodity 
Business Management, Global Information System (GIS), 
Information Security Risk Management (ISRM), InfoSec, 
Legal and Compliance Organization (LCO and Global 
General Procurement.

To enhance customer trust, we provide virus-free  
certifications with all sales of Applied semiconductor 
systems.

In 2022, we completed 240 supply chain cybersecurity 
assessments, monitored 2,500 suppliers for potential 
disruption, and experienced no impacts to customer 
shipments or IP leaks as a result of cyberattacks in our 
supply chain.

Security Leadership Team
Applied’s Security Leadership Team improves IP risk visibility and defenses by identifying 
security gaps, and providing a forum for teams to seek executive feedback and support. The 
team also works to drive efficiency, consistency and accountability in processes and reporting. 
Comprising senior legal, HR and finance executives, and supported by a project management 
office (PMO), the team:

• Conducts outreach to individual risk management programs to surface vulnerabilities and 

needs, and to gain a holistic view into Applied’s risk posture

• Facilitates integration workshops with IP protection programs to share best practices

• Engages with programs that may present risk to Applied’s environment, in order to align on 

obligations and connect teams with mitigation resources

The Security Leadership Team conducts meetings with executives twice per quarter and  
with the PMO semi-monthly.

Valuable Intellectual Property Program
The Valuable Intellectual Property (VIP) 
program seeks to raise awareness across 
Applied on IP protection issues to enable each 
employee and contractor to protect company, 
customer and supplier IP. Through the Insider 
Risk & IP Protection Awareness Campaign 
(held throughout September 2022), the VIP 
program raised awareness on a variety of 
topics, including:

• IP risks in dual employment

• How to protect IP in social media

Throughout the year, the VIP program partners 
with other teams across Applied to pursue 
lessons learned, creating trainings or controls 
as appropriate to best protect IP.

• Limiting information sharing to need-to-know

• Proper use of internal and external 

collaboration tools

• Safeguarding customer confidential 

information

The VIP program partners with Compliance 
Champions throughout Applied’s workforce 
to raise awareness on IP protection and 
compliance topics.

PRODUCT SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAM

In 2022, we formed a new Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) 
and created supporting PSIRT processes to enhance our ability to handle 
cybersecurity issues involving our products and services.

Personal Data Privacy

Applied Materials respects the privacy of all individuals with whom 
we communicate and interact, whether directly or via our software or 
website. Our privacy policy describes procedures regarding our collection, 
use, storage and disclosure of personal information collected through 
these channels, and we maintain a dedicated email address for all 
questions and comments about our data privacy policies and safeguards.

In 2022, we continued to adapt and expand our privacy program to comply with evolving global laws 
and new laws effective in 2023. To assure a more comprehensive privacy compliance, we: 

• Modernized our Document Retention Policy, streamlining it for better execution, efficiency 

and consistent implementation

• Continued automating our data privacy program using a platform that centralizes privacy 

policies, assessments and other documentation, and allows for the mapping of personal data 
across our systems

Applied Materials Global Privacy Principles 
Applied Materials is committed to 
safeguarding the data of our employees and 
trusted business partners. We recognize 
the importance that our global workforce, 
customers and suppliers place on their 
personal information (PI), and we take 
seriously our obligations to protect that data. 
We published our internal Global Privacy 
Principles in 2022 to help serve as guiding 
principles for how the company—and our 
workforce—should safeguard PI. 

obligations, and updated numerous global 
and region-specific policies, including our 
Document Retention Policy, Global Image 
Taking and Web Recording Policy, and our 
internal and external privacy policies.

We continue to leverage technology to 
visualize how PI flows throughout our 
organization, create a unified approach 
to compliance, and proactively keep pace 
with increasingly complex and sometimes 
conflicting privacy and data laws. Using an 
industry-leading privacy compliance platform, 
we standardized, semi-automated and 
streamlined our privacy reviews of the new 
technologies and applications that Applied 
is onboarding for its own use, reducing 
compliance risk while minimizing the impact  
to business operations.

2022 was another active year in the privacy 
regulatory landscape worldwide, with major 
updates in most of the regions in which 
Applied operates. In response to these trends, 
we updated our Enterprise Incident Response 
Plan, enhanced and provided training and 
awareness around these new laws and

Through efforts led by Applied and the Applied Materials 
Foundation, we serve the needs and values of our employees 
and the communities where we live and work, making them 
part of who we are and what we stand for as a company.

Applied and the Foundation deploy human and financial 
resources worldwide to help social impact and nonprofit 
organizations fulfill their service missions free of 
discrimination against any group or individual. Employee 
engagement amplifies our positive community impact, 
often via company-initiated events that connect our people 
with local nonprofits for volunteer work or personal charity 
support. Our Employee Giving and Volunteer Time Grant 
programs amplify our people’s impact. During culturally 
significant celebrations, such as Black History Month and 
Pride Month, our employee communications highlight local 
and national charities working for social justice and equity, 
suggesting ways to make a positive impact.

Applied and the Foundation focus funding across five 
primary areas: education, civic engagement, arts and 
culture, the environment and girls’ empowerment—the latter 
primarily through the Generation Girl® initiative, a signature 
Foundation program. We also pivot in response to societal 
need, as we did in 2022 to support organizations helping 
Ukrainians displaced by the Russia invasion. 

In 2022, Applied and the Foundation awarded $11.2M in 
direct corporate contributions and Foundation grants, 
benefiting 260 recipients in nine countries. The total 
represents a decrease from 2021 due to budget constraints.

We believe our role as a corporate citizen and as individual 
human beings is to make the world a better place, and we 
are committed to taking meaningful action.

A Commitment to Equity-Centered Engagement
At Applied Materials, we believe equity-
centered community engagement 
contributes to a more just, fair and humane 
world. We are committed to learning from 
leaders who live the issues we want to 
help solve, and to working respectfully 
with voices at the community level. We 
are determined to support solutions that 
address societal imbalances, provide 
access to resources and opportunity, 
and build thriving, resilient families and 
neighborhoods. 

• Grantmaking: Applied and the Applied 
Materials Foundation began collecting 
detailed information about publicly self-
identified race or ethnicity of potential 
grantees to ensure that the organizations 
we’re funding are led and staffed by people 
who are representative of and trusted by 
the communities they serve. To increase 
transparency, we began posting names and 
information for all grant recipients on our 
website in 2022, segmented by Applied 
Materials grantees and Applied Materials 
Foundation grantees.

“ I volunteer with Opening Doors 2020 for an hour

San Jose community experiencing homelessness.  
I am grateful that Applied Purpose matches  
my volunteer time with monetary donations

Two years ago, the Global Community 
Affairs team at Applied Materials partnered 
with Black-owned consulting firm Frontline 
Solutions to conduct an equity assessment 
that examined both our philanthropic work’s 
programs and practices and the personal 
beliefs of those efforts’ leadership and staff, 
seeking to identify unintended barriers 
arising from biases, norms or systemic 
structures. Based on the assessment’s 
results and Frontline Solutions’ feedback, we 
made a public declaration of commitment 
to equity-centered community involvement 
across three core areas. In 2022, we 
continued acting on those commitments: 

• Employee engagement: Supported by 

outside vendor Visit.org, our Community 
Affairs team worked to expand 
opportunities to engage employees with 
high-impact nonprofits outside our existing 
network, with a focus on organizations 
serving and led by people of color.

• Personal and professional development: 
To ensure that Applied and Foundation 
decision-making structures and 
Community Affairs operations are 
centered in equity, our teams continued a 
program of internal learning activities to 
address biases and norms that negatively 
impact communities and organizations of 
color. We also began funding DEI-focused 
professional development opportunities 
for nonprofits in the community, including 
Racial Justice Learning Series workshops 
conducted by the Silicon Valley Council of 
Nonprofits and trainings for Austin-area 
organizations on using data to support 
community- and mission-driven services 
for communities of color.

Promoting Civic Engagement,  
Development and Relief
Civic engagement grants from Applied and the Foundation strengthen the ability 
of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and the nonprofit sector to address 
community challenges and help people find stability in difficult times. We channel 
funding to organizations that address food insecurity and homelessness, secure 
affordable housing for people in need, provide job and career training, inspire 
collaborative solutions for community challenges, and build the capacity of the 
nonprofit sector. We also contribute to relief and recovery efforts in response to 
natural and manmade disasters around the world.

In 2022, Applied Materials and the Foundation provided $1.8M in grants to  
71 organizations that:

•  Provide basic needs and resources for homeless, low-income 

and immigrant communities

•  Conduct after-school and youth leadership development 

programs for at-risk youth

•  Provide help to seniors living alone

•  Engage community members in addressing issues of human 

rights, inclusion, anti-Asian hate and equality

•  Promote collaboration to solve community challenges

Fight Against Hunger
Around the globe, food insecurity increased year-over-year in 2022 due 
primarily to food price inflation and the disruption of grain exports from 
Ukraine and the greater Black Sea region. In the U.S., the expiration of many 
COVID-era nutrition programs and rising food costs combined to boost food 
insecurity by some 6% over 2021.

In the face of this need, Applied Materials continued its annual Fight Against 
Hunger fundraising campaign. In North America, our employees raised $1.89 
million. Adding a dollar-for-dollar match from the Foundation, we were able to 
distribute $3.8 million to 53 food banks across the U.S. and Canada. 

Globally, our employees in Korea, Greece, and Taiwan made notable 
contributions to the effort. In our Greece organization, which joined Applied 
Materials in 2020 via our acquisition of IP startup Think Silicon, employees 
ran their first Fight Against Hunger campaign in partnership with nonprofit 
To Chamogelo tou Pediou (The Smile of the Child), raising $11,427 with the 
Foundation match to help alleviate hunger in local communities.

In Taiwan, a combination of employee giving and Foundation matching funds 
raised US$88,000 for separate initiatives of the Children Are Us Foundation, 
the Garden of Hope Foundation, and Taiwan People’s Food Bank Association 
that explore the hunger issue from different angles. The donation will provide 
vulnerable individuals, families and communities hunger relief, nutrition 
education and community development assistance throughout the year. Our 
Korea-based employees supported the Fight Against Hunger campaign by 
teaming with Child Fund Korea to raise funds to purchase boxes of nutritious 
food for those who need it most.

All these efforts reflect Applied’s values and purpose, aligning who we are with 
what matters to our employees and what’s needed in our communities.

Support for Ukraine Refugee Relief
Russia’s attack on Ukraine in February 2022 resulted 
in Europe’s largest internal refugee crisis since World 
War II, uprooting 13 million people from their homes. 
Nearly 8 million refugees are currently scattered 
across Europe, and more than 5 million are internally 
displaced within Ukraine.

Applied Materials and our employees responded 
immediately to this crisis. In the first four months of the 
war, our European colleagues donated approximately 
112,650 EUR, which the company matched for a 
total 225,000 EUR donation to Save the Children 
Deutschland eV. These funds allowed the nonprofit to 
provide food and shelter to displaced Ukrainian families, 
equip children to continue their educations, and operate 
mobile youth spaces in remote communities to give 
children a safe and supportive environment to socialize 
and play. Additionally, our operations and employees 
in France, Germany, Israel, and Italy acted through 
grantmaking, volunteering, and individual and matching 
donations to support internally and externally displaced 

Ukrainians with food, supplies, and help integrating into 
host communities. As part of these efforts:

• Colleagues in Israel spearheaded several efforts on 

behalf of Ukrainian refugees, collecting donations that 
were matched by the company to provide a $55,000 
donation to UNICEF Ukraine, collecting 15 boxes of 
blankets and winter clothing that were transported 
to the Poland/Ukraine border for distribution, and 
collecting 1,000 food parcels and boxes of personal 
hygiene items for Ukrainian refugees arriving in 
Israel. Additionally, a group of Ukrainian-speaking 
Applied employees volunteered to provide refugee 
schoolchildren with weekly Hebrew language 
assistance and homework tutoring.

• Colleagues in France worked with local charity 

Protection Civile Isère to collect food and goods for 
shipment to Ukraine at the start of the war.

• Colleagues in Alzenau and Darmstadt, Germany, 

collected 300 kilos of food donations that were sent 
to Ukraine by the charity Hoffnungsträger Ost e. V.

Applied Materials believes all children of every race, gender 
and income level deserve equal opportunity to follow their 
dreams and reach their full potential, but barriers to access 
too frequently stand in the way. Starting early in life, girls—
particularly girls of color and from low-income backgrounds—
face stereotypes, gender bias, and other structural and 
societal barriers that can prevent them reaching their full 
potential. Women remain greatly underrepresented in many 
fields, including STEM, and the gender disparity is even more 
pronounced in executive leadership roles.

To do our part to highlight and address these inequalities, the 
Applied Materials Foundation created Generation Girl, a five-
year initiative that invests in organizations and programs that 
support girls in developing self-efficacy and confidence, offer 
access to high-quality STEM education, and build the capacity of 
girl-serving nonprofits. By equipping girls with the knowledge and 
confidence to enter professions where women are historically 
underrepresented, we’re helping create a future where women—
regardless of their background—can thrive in their field of choice.

In year four of the Generation Girl initiative, the Foundation 
provided over $945,000 in grants to 28 programs across the U.S., 
reaching 8,873 girls—a 48% increase from year three (2020–21). 
Our year-end findings and participant survey results showed

• Generation Girl is reaching its target population: We focus 
our support to grantee organizations that primarily serve 
middle school and high school girls, engaging girls of color 
and girls from low-income backgrounds. In 2022, 82% of 
grantee programs served girls in middle or high school,  
with the remaining 18% serving girls in elementary  
and/or post-secondary school. The percentage of low-
income girls served dropped slightly to 62% from 64% 
in 2020–21. As organizations increased their in-person 
programs, the percentage of Hispanic/Latina, African 
American/Black and Native American/Indigenous girls 
decreased to 60% from 69% in 2020–21.

• Generation Girl served adults who are important to girls’ 
lives and success: Two programs focused on strengthening 
the sector provided 317 adults with substantive training 
to increase their capacity to provide high-quality, gender-
equitable programs. Sixteen grantee organizations focusing 
on girls’ empowerment and STEM outcomes engaged 3,388 
parents, relatives, mentors, after-school coordinators, 
teachers and other adults through resource-sharing and 
providing technological support.

• Generation Girl supported girls’ feelings of self-efficacy and 
self-confidence: In 2021–22, 86% of girls surveyed reported 
positive levels of self-efficacy and 80% reported positive 
levels of self-confidence. Both results are commensurate with 
pre-pandemic levels.

• Generation Girl helped girls explore STEM and its 
connection to their goals: Ninety-three percent of 
participants increased their STEM competency (a 20% jump 
from 2020–21) and 85% increased their STEM interest (+10% 
from 2020–21). Ninety-three percent also reported believing 
that STEM skills are relevant to their daily lives (+5%, the 
highest reported level since the initiative began), 79% 
reported increased awareness of STEM careers, and 83% 
increased their interest in pursuing a post-secondary degree.

• Generation Girl continued facilitating connections among 

grantees: Ninety-two percent of grantee organizations 
reported that networking and collaboration opportunities 
through Generation Girl improved their practice, and 100% 
reported that the Generation Girl Community of Practice, 
in which representatives from our 30 grantee organizations 
meet to discuss common challenges and pursue partnership 
opportunities, strengthened their programs.

As a Generation Girl grantee, the National Alliance 
for Partnerships in Equity Education Foundation has 
been working with the Manor Independent School 
District in Central Texas to increase participation 
and performance on the math pipeline. When their 
efforts began in 2018, the percentage of girls taking 
Algebra 1 in eighth grade was 26%. This year, 
100% of the district’s sixth grade girls are enrolled 
in advanced math, putting Manor ISD on track for 
100% enrollment in eighth grade Algebra 1 in the 
2024–25 school year.

Promoting Education Access
At Applied Materials, we believe education inspires young minds, opens new doors and 
paves the way to more promising futures. Putting this philosophy into action globally, the 
company and the Foundation invest in efforts to help students fulfill their academic potential, 
regardless of their socioeconomic status, race, gender or where they call home.

In 2022, Applied Materials and the Applied Materials Foundation 
awarded over $2.1 million in grants to 58 organizations 
providing direct educational services and teacher professional 
development. We prioritize programs that both address local 
challenges and align with our longtime education strategy, which 
aims to prepare students for every stage of the education journey:

• Enter kindergarten ready to learn: To engage children 

early in their education, we funded organizations such as 
Grail Family Services (East San Jose, CA) and AVANCE 
(Austin, TX), which provide impactful, culturally responsive 
programming for children and their families. 

• Read at grade level in elementary school: Applied and the 

Foundation work with organizations that raise literacy rates for 
the youngest learners while instilling a lifelong love of reading. 
In the U.S., we supported Springboard Collaborative (East 
San Jose, CA), Bookspring (Austin, TX) and SMART Reading 
(Hillsboro, OR), organizations dedicated to make reading 
exciting and accessible to youth and their families. Outside the 
U.S., we funded work by Wuxi Lingshan Charity Foundation 
(China) and the Boyo Social Welfare Foundation (Taiwan) to 
improve literacy for underserved youth.

• Succeed in rigorous middle school math and science:  
In middle school, our focus turns to math and science 
readiness. Support from both Applied and the Foundation 
for the Silicon Valley Education Foundation focuses 
on accelerating teacher effectiveness in math through 
professional learning and peer collaboration in East San José, 
CA. In Austin, TX, Foundation funding underwrites work by 
the National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity to increase 
the enrollment of Black and Hispanic/Latino youth (especially 
girls) in academically rigorous middle school math courses.

• Graduate high school ready for college and/or career: 
Once students are excited about learning, Applied and 
the Foundation encourage them to dream big. Foundation 
collaborations with Breakthrough Central Texas (Austin, 
TX), Breakthrough Silicon Valley (San Jose, CA) and College 
Possible (Portland, OR) help ensure students are ready for 
college academically and emotionally. In Gloucester, MA, 
Applied and the Foundation support for LEAP for Education’s 
Career Ready program provides high schoolers with a 
better understanding of career options. In Israel, Applied 
works with the Israel Scholarship Education Foundation to 
encourage boarding school students to complete high school 
and pursue higher education. In Singapore, an Applied grant 
to Community Chest seeks to maximize the educational 
experience for at-risk or out-of-school youth.

Both Applied Materials and the Foundation prioritize 
programs that engage families in their students’ 
academic success. We also fund efforts to engage 
youth early and often in hands-on STEM programs, 
helping them understand the link between their 
academic studies and future career paths. In 2022, 
Applied and the Foundation funded STEM programs 
for youth in the U.S. and internationally:

• In Montana, the Foundation supports Flathead 

County Library Foundation’s free Summer STEM 
Experience.

• Foundation support for the Western Idaho Science 

and Engineering Fair and the Arizona Science 
Center improves access to STEM programming for 
rural students.

• In India, our corporate support is helping Pratham 
Education Foundation create a Science Center in 
Maharashtra.

• In Korea, Applied funding provides elementary 

students with hands-on science education through 
Child Fund Korea.

• In Japan, we support a Houkago NPO After School 

program focused on computer programming.

Supporting Environmental Causes
Beyond efforts to reduce the footprint of our operations and products, Applied’s environmental 
commitment includes funding from Applied and the Applied Materials Foundation for 
environmentally beneficial projects. In 2022, we awarded a combined $0.7M in grants to 38 
nonprofits that are helping build a sustainable future through environmental education and 
stewardship, animal and habitat protection, conservation and repair efforts, tree planting, and 
improving natural spaces in urban settings. Highlighted recipients of the year’s giving included:

• Shanghai Pudong LIFE Environment 

• Austin Youth River Watch (Austin, TX) to 

Promotion Center (China) to promote public 
awareness of the need for environmental 
protection and to organize cleanup events 
around the country 

provide after-school and summer programs 
focused on hands-on science, mentoring 
and outdoor adventure for youth from 
historically marginalized communities

• Moatza le Shimur Atarim (Israel) to create an 
organic vegetable garden where underserved 
children gain knowledge through hands-on 
environmental education 

• Morino Project (Japan) to promote 

environmental resilience against future 
tsunamis by growing a new forest in a 
tsunami-destroyed area

educate and engage youth on the importance 
of environmental sustainability through 
project-based learning 

• National Parks Board (Singapore) to support 
efforts to plant one million trees across the 
island over the next 10 years

• Society of Wilderness (Taiwan) to increase 

awareness of important environmental issues 
through lectures, wilderness excursions and 
hands-on activities for elementary students

• Merrohawke Nature School (Gloucester, 

MA) to teach local youth about the 
maritime industry 

• Whitefish Legacy Partners (Kalispell, MT)  
to host free outdoor education programs 
and provide community volunteer 
opportunities on the Whitefish Trail

• Green Foothills Foundation (Silicon 

Valley, CA) to train and invest in local 
environmental leaders from historically 
underrepresented communities

INSPIRING ACTION THROUGH EARTHWORKS

From April through June, Applied’s annual EarthWorks campaign 
aims to educate and inspire our global employees on ways to 
adopt sustainable practices and technologies in their daily lives, 
homes and communities. In 2022, Applied employees conducted 
community and waterway clean-up, promoted carbon-free 
commuting, learned about climate advocacy and the impact of 
waste on communities of color, created 15,000 seedballs for 
planting, planted trees in tsunami-damaged areas, hosted a water 
conservation campaign, and packed environmental education kits 
for elementary school students.

Sustainability Report 2022Funding Arts and Culture
The COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on the arts worldwide. In the U.S., the 
arts economy shrank at nearly twice the rate of the economy as a whole in 2019–20, with 
performing arts shrinking by nearly 73%. Though pandemic impacts and restrictions began 
falling worldwide in 2022, many arts organizations that survived are still struggling.

To support arts programming and performances, museums and exhibitions, arts education and 
engagement, and culture- and heritage-focused arts programming, Applied and the Applied 
Materials Foundation awarded $1M in grants to 59 nonprofits in FY22. We funded projects 
that provided global youth with access to high-quality arts education programming, such as:

I N T R O D U C T I O N

• Arts in Action (San Jose, CA), which provides art kits for three schools that serve under-

resourced communities

• Hockaday Museum of Art’s Engaging Youth in the Arts program (Kalispell, MT), which helps 

children connect with art and their community through hands-on activities, engagement 
with working artists and historic art, and public display of their own artwork

• Shanghai Charyou Youth Volunteer Service Center (China), which works to enhance the 

confidence of children who learn and share their own talent and traditional art culture while 
strengthening mutual understanding and respect in their community

Volunteering in Our Communities
To improve our people’s sense of purpose 
and engagement, Applied Materials seeks 
opportunities through which we can put our 
talents to work serving the communities 
where we live and work. We seek input 
from community organizations to assure 
that activities are truly meaningful and 
impactful, and provide Employee Giving and 
Volunteer Time Grant programs that allow 
our employees worldwide to maximize their 
personal charity support.

Groups with a significantly deeper catalog 
of engagement opportunities that align with 
cultural, environmental, educational and 
other initiatives throughout the year—such 
as learning about the environmental impact 
of waste on communities of color, discussing 
issues disproportionately affecting girls, or 
empowering Asian-American voices through 
performances by Asian poets, musicians, 
dancers and storytellers.

In 2022, Applied began partnering with 
Visit.org to expand our reach to new 
organizations beyond our existing networks 
and local geographies, and to help us bring 
a greater equity lens to our volunteering 
work. Visit.org provides a searchable library 
of curated virtual volunteer and engagement 
opportunities across nonprofit organizations 
working both within and beyond Applied’s 
core engagement areas. The system provides 

In 2022, Applied Materials employees donated

security. We are committed to protecting the 
fundamental human rights of our employees 
and those of our suppliers, as formalized in our 
Human Rights Statement of Principles. 

We invest in building an inclusive talent 
pipeline to expand opportunities for those who 
have been traditionally underrepresented in 
tech, benefitting individuals while providing 
our company and industry with future talent to 
power future growth. To seed the pipeline, we 
partner with nonprofit organizations, colleges 
and universities to foster interest and build 
STEM capabilities, particularly among girls and 
underrepresented minorities. Our investments 
continue into early-career development, 
with robust programs supporting interns, 
new college graduates (NCGs) and women 
in engineering and technology—because we 
know human potential is the fuel behind our 
company’s potential.

Recruiting and Hiring

When we say Applied Materials works to 
Make Possible a Better Future, we don’t just 
mean through technology innovation. A better 
future is also a more fair and industrious 
future, where people can follow their passions 
into careers that bring out their full potential 
and put that potential to work for the greater 
good. At Applied, we’re making that vision a 
reality through our commitment to inclusion 
and diversity in all our practices for attracting, 
engaging and retaining top-performing talent.

“ Applied values veterans. 
They know we have a 
strong technical foundation, 
troubleshooting skills and a 
community-focused mindset.”

Recruiting Diverse Talent 
Our diverse talent recruiting has a global scope, seeking 
candidates from the technology industry and related fields and 
attracting talented new graduates from universities with strong 
engineering and science programs, including U.S. schools with 
large Black and Hispanic/Latino student populations. Through 
STEM education initiatives with colleges, universities and 
nonprofit partners serving middle and high school students, 
we are also building a pipeline of diverse future talent. Over 
the past two years, we’ve pursued a range of initiatives and 
technologies to help us achieve our diversity goals: 

• Introducing a Diverse Talent Sourcing Platform that enables 

searches for diverse candidates 

• Rolling out a global Talent Selection Playbook that helps 

managers define their talent needs, then assess and select the 
most appropriate candidates 

• Doubling our referral bonus program to reward employees 

for recommending successful candidates for customer 
engineering and other technical roles 

• Expanding talent searches beyond our physical operating 

regions to broaden our potential talent pool 

• Recruiting military talent as they exit the U.S. services 

We have also partnered with a third party to help showcase 
Applied’s inclusion culture—for example, by arranging for one 
of our female engineers who began as an intern to speak at the 
Singapore Semiconductor Industry Association Women’s Forum 
and in a social media video. We have also appointed a group 
of ambassadors and social media influencers from diverse 
backgrounds to represent Applied’s Culture of Inclusion.

These initiatives and others have contributed to a year-over-
year increase in the representation of global women, U.S. 
women and U.S. URM employees at nearly every level of 
Applied’s workforce.

DEI WORLDWIDE

In 2022, Applied Materials locations worldwide 
conducted initiatives to support our DEI goals.

TAIWAN: To engage female engineering talent 
and elevate our employer brand, we launched 
a new “High Tech Girls” program with more 
than 350 women participants, and partnered 
with SEMICON’s “Women in Tech” workforce 
workstream to provide career talks and face-to-
face engagements as part of a trade show. In our 
Field Service Operations’ iTeam organization, 
we created mandatory interview guidance to 
boost interview opportunities for female talent 
and further elevate our female hire rate, which 
increased 53% in FY22 over FY21.

IRELAND: We continued our relationship 
with STEM Women Ireland and are working 
to engage their network of of STEM women 
students and graduates.

ISRAEL: We renewed our relationship with  
Co-Impact, an organization that connects global 
tech companies with qualified Arab candidates 
in Israel, and are planning to receive candidates 
in 2023. 

INDIA: To fill 90+ positions targeted  
for gender diversity hiring across all business 
units, a slate of 100 candidates was presented, 
yielding 69 offers and 63 acceptances (91%). 
Year-over-year hiring of female candidates rose by 
38% over 2021.

Recruiting and Hiring Next-Generation Talent
Throughout 2022, we evolved our recruiting, hiring and onboarding practices to reach incoming tech talent, 
showcasing Applied as a company that offers opportunity, growth and learning in an environment of respect and 
corporate responsibility. We onboarded 350 new college graduates during the year, among whom 38.3% were 
female and 32% were URMs. Our efforts included: 

• New college graduate rotation programs: 
To drive in-depth cross-functional training, 
provide access to our global knowledge, 
and assure optimal placement of new hires, 
internal organizations including Supply Chain, 
Global Field Group, Finance (Austin, TX and 
Santa Clara, CA) and Implant (Gloucester, 
MA) offered rotation programs that included 
mentoring, networking, skills development 
and hands-on experience across various 
areas of their operations. 

• University recruiting events: To reach 

the next generation of Applied talent, our 
University Recruiting Team participated in 
52 career fairs and 30 networking events 
in spring and fall 2022, at colleges and 
universities around the U.S. In Korea, we 
recruited at more than 20 universities and 
attended six job fairs, meeting nearly 3,000 
students and potential candidates. In Taiwan, 
we attended 23 campus events with a 
pipeline of 4,381 students.

• Internships: In North America and globally, hybrid  

in-person/virtual internship programs continued giving 
students exposure to our diverse and inclusive workplace, 
introducing them to career paths and roles in both engineering 
and corporate. Highlights of the year included a “Meet the 
CEO” summer intern event and a new Manufacturing Intern 
Program for students at two-year colleges. In the U.S., we hired 
a total of 262 interns, 46.9% of whom were female and 21.8% 
of whom were URMs. Additional internships were offered in 
our operations in India (23) and Taiwan (15). 

• GEM scholarships: Applied is collaborating with the 

National GEM Consortium, an organization dedicated to 
increasing the participation of underrepresented groups at 
the master’s and doctoral levels in engineering and science. 
In the first year of the partnership, we hired four GEM 
interns for positions in our Chief Technology Office and 
Semiconductor Products Group organizations.

• China programs: Spanning 15 Applied locations in China, 
our China New Star NCG program saw 26% female new 
hires in 2022. We also organized seven virtual networking 
events attracting 1,000+ attendees and a dedicated live 
online presentation that logged 63,000 views.

Over the past several years, Applied Materials has been 
working to grow a Culture of Inclusion across every 
business group, function, strategy, process and region of 
our company, and we’re doing it for one simple reason: 
helping everyone succeed. We know that driving cultural 
transformation around diversity, respect, fairness, and 
teamwork helps our employees to become their best 
selves, sets our company up for greater success, and 
models the equity and inclusion that should be among 
the hallmarks of a just society. 

Now more than ever, Applied is positioned to be a 
leader in creating a more diverse, inclusive culture 
and showing our industry a winning employee value 
proposition for the future. With analysts predicting that 
the global semiconductor industry will grow to  
$1 trillion in revenues by 2030, our employee base  

will need to grow by roughly 60,000 employees over 
the same period. Generation Z will be a big part of 
that growth, and with 48% of that cohort representing 
communities of color, the industry must become a 
place where they can feel at home. 

In 2020, our CEO, Gary Dickerson, announced DEI 
commitments to increase transparency, establish 
meaningful targets, and implement training to 
reduce bias and educate employees on how to listen, 
learn and act. This year we made progress against 
all three, including announcing in this report a new 
set of 2030 diversity goals designed to increase 
the number of women in our global workforce and 
underrepresented minorities in the U.S., at both the 
employee and executive levels. 

Our Executive Leadership Team is committed to 
continually transforming our culture to be more inclusive, 
operationalizing DEI in all of our processes, and achieving 
our DEI goals. To assure we achieve our goals by 2030, in 
2022 we launched our DEI Engine, a new framework of 
tools, training and processes for all employees, aimed at 
moving our transformation to the next level.

“ Inclusion is empowering every voice on 

the team. If I look at my own team, every 
person brings a unique gift, a unique 
talent that we can use to help solve 
problems. And if we are not leveraging 
everybody on the team, then we’re never 
going to be as good as we can be.”

Carl
Austin, Texas

Applied’s DEI Vision
Diversity, equity and inclusion isn’t just a slogan.  
The words have real meaning.

DIVERSITY means everyone: the variety of differences 
and similarities among people, often called “diversity 
dimensions.”

EQUITY is the guarantee of fair treatment, access, 
opportunity and advancement, paired with a process 
that identifies and eliminates barriers that have 
held some groups back from full participation. This 
principle acknowledges that there are historically 
underserved and underrepresented populations and 
that we need fairness to restore balance, equality and 
opportunity for all groups.

INCLUSION is a dynamic state of feeling, belonging and 
operating in which diversity is leveraged and valued to 
create a fair, healthy and high-performing organization.

At Applied, DEI means embracing change as a new governing 
philosophy, not just tweaking the tactics and strategies of the past. At 
its most basic level, it’s about breaking the cycle of looks-like-me hiring 
and welcoming new employees of all backgrounds and experiences. But 
DEI has to be more holistic than just talent, embracing an expansive 
and empathetic mindset that not only sees but seeks the value in 
difference and works toward that ideal in everything we do, including: 

• Embedding a culture of respect, empathy and collaboration  

across our strategy and business processes 

• Creating safe spaces where all voices can be heard 

• Reinventing our culture to value a healthier work/life balance

• Identifying and partnering with more diverse suppliers

Building Our DEI Engine
Launched in November 2022, our DEI Engine is a framework of tools, training 
and processes to accelerate our Culture of Inclusion strategy. The engine has 
three pillars: 

1.  Ingrain an inclusive culture where everyone can speak safely and be fully 

heard, and where we leverage and embrace our differences across all levels 
of the organization

2.  Inspire, engage and attract world-class talent by incorporating DEI 

throughout the employee experience, including hiring, promotion, rewards 
and benefits

3.  Impact DEI in industry and society through leadership and stakeholder 

engagement, creating pathways that reduce social, economic and 
educational inequities

The DEI Engine will help  
Applied Materials: 

• Activate our Culture of Inclusion 

strategy to enable a more connected 
and inclusive culture

• Create a common DEI language, 

process and metrics to advance our 
Culture of Inclusion

• Accelerate our connected culture 

through inclusive leader behaviors, 
decisions, actions and outcomes

• Demonstrate our DEI commitment 

to all our stakeholders

• Personalize DEI for everyone, 

inspiring personal commitment 
through “Applied Inclusion: It Starts 
with Me” messaging

• Create more innovative solutions 

that are shared across the enterprise

Our DEI Engine will engage everyone  
to listen, learn and act, and 
operationalize our Culture of 
Inclusion through:

• Mandatory virtual learning, with a 

90% completion target

• Experiential learning, providing a 
scaled menu for all levels of the 
company, with leaders as teachers

• Resource toolkits for leaders and 

individuals

• Communication strategy including 
multimedia, Employee Resource 
Group (ERG) events and our Global 
Inclusion Summit

• Partnerships with ERGs to tie 

together strategies impacting DEI 
from across the enterprise

2022 GLOBAL CULTURE OF INCLUSION SUMMIT 

“Applied Inclusion: It Starts with Me” was the theme of our first ever month-
long Inclusion Summit in June 2022, which included three mainstage global 
sessions and 48 regional events at 17 Applied sites around the world, both 
live and virtual. Topics ranged from general discussions of gender, race 
and LGBTQ+ issues to focuses on disabilities and innovation, personal 
development, multi-generational teams, neurodiversity, mental health,  
micro-aggressions/bias and inclusive leadership. 

Engaging Leaders as Champions of Change
As Applied Materials evolves to make DEI integral to the way we do 
business, our leaders are increasingly demonstrating their personal 
commitment to raising awareness and driving change. 

At our 2022 Applied Leadership Group (ALG) meeting, over 400 senior leaders learned about 
inclusion not only as a concept, but as a personal story and a call to action. Several leaders 
gave powerful, passionate speeches about how inclusion matters to them personally, and all 
attendees were asked to take three actions:

• Seek out learning to improve their personal inclusive leadership 

• Identify actions to improve and embed the Culture of Inclusion in their organizational and 

talent strategy

• Talk about what inclusion means to them in multiple forums

WORKFORCE DIVERSITY RECOGNITION

Applied Materials is consistently recognized for our efforts 
around workforce diversity and military veteran recruitment.

During a panel discussion, leaders heard 
from ERG leadership about how their groups 
offer opportunities for employees to create a 
more inclusive culture, advance themselves 
professionally and volunteer in their 
communities. Panel members encouraged 
leaders to support and advocate for ERGs, and 
to consider becoming executive sponsors. 

For the second year, U.S. leaders also 
participated in a Berkeley Executive Coaching 
Institute (BECI) “Coaching for Inclusion” 
program, which builds on previous diversity 
trainings through a focus on: 

• Building core capabilities and helping 

leaders develop an authentic leadership 
presence around DEI 

• Building empathy and an understanding of 
how DEI issues affect oneself and others 

• Becoming more conscious of how personal 
behaviors can unintentionally reinforce 
unproductive dynamics 

• Making personal commitments for change in 
their leadership style and their approach to 
influencing change across the enterprise

The program is delivered via an initial two-day 
session, plus coaching, independent study and 
a follow-up workshop. In 2022, more than 100 
Applied leaders completed the program.

These efforts build on changes introduced 
in prior years to help our leaders take 
Applied Materials in the direction we need 
to go—changes such as introducing an 
Inclusive Leader Action Guide to provide 
pragmatic strategies and best practices for 
our executive staff and people managers, 
creating diversity dashboards that allow 
U.S. leaders to track progress against 
diversity goals for each organization, and 
tying executive compensation directly to the 
achievement of our diversity objectives via 
our Corporate Scorecard.

Our Culture of Inclusion progress is shared on 
a quarterly basis with our Human Resources 
and Compensation Committee.

Employee Resource Groups
Applied Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are one important 
way we ingrain inclusive culture, inspire and engage our 
diverse talent, and positively impact the communities in 
which we work and live. Today, our network includes eight 
ERGs, with 28 chapters around the world. 

Young Professionals Network (YPN): To foster an increased sense of 
belonging for new hires and new college graduates, YPN sponsored “YPN 
Week” at all Applied U.S. sites, which offered opportunities to network with 
fellow newly hired graduates as well as Applied executives and leaders across 
diverse gender, race, cultural and socio-economic backgrounds. This event 
helped new hires learn and grow beyond their job roles, find mentors, increase 
understanding and compassion for diverse groups, and serve our community.

• Applied PRIDE

• Asians in Motion

• Hispanics in Partnership

• Leadership Encouraging Achievement through  

Diversity / Black Employee Network

• Male ERG for Equity

• Veterans Employee Team

• Women’s Professional Development Network

• Young Professionals Network

Our ERGs continue to increase in overall membership and 
create programs and events that support and promote our 
Culture of Inclusion. In 2022, ERGs sponsored learning, 
networking and community service events across the world. 
Here are just a few highlights:

Women’s Professional Development Network (WPDN): Over the course of 
2022, three virtual events sponsored by the Taiwan WPDN focused on one 
theme: “empowering women.” The series kicked off with a webinar combining 
industry insights with financial management methods. “A Conversation About 
Women’s Empowerment” featured female speakers who shared how women 
can empower each other to support, inspire and achieve their goals in the 
workplace and in life. Finally, a “Celebrate Empowerment and Your Peers” 
Yammer campaign invited employees to celebrate the accomplishments of 
their peers and family members.

Veterans Employee Team: This U.S.-based military veterans ERG completed 
its second annual “Veterans Helping Veterans” community service project 
with nonprofit Rebuilding Together Silicon Valley (RTSV) to paint and 
repair the home of a local Korean War veteran in need. Applied has a long-
standing reputation as a top employer for veterans, regularly ranking as one 
of the best workplaces for veterans. We currently employ more than 1,000 
veterans including approximately 330 newly hired in 2022. 

“ Diversity and inclusion have been a really big focus 
area at Applied. And it’s something that I find, in 
our culture, we really, really value. I grew up in the 
U.S. and for me, it’s been really interesting to learn 
where other people come from and ask about their 
history, their culture, what they do, what they don’t 
do, and see if I can apply that.”

Learning and Development

Applied Materials creates growth and 
development opportunities that support  
an engaged and inclusive workforce  
to propel our business into the future. 

Our employee learning and development program focuses 
on improving technical skills, professional capabilities and 
business acumen, enabling every individual to excel in their 
current role while preparing them for career growth. All training 
is coordinated centrally and aligned with common objectives 
through Applied Global University (AGU), the delivery arm of our 
Learning and Development organization, with corporate providing 
general professional, management and leadership training and 
our business units and functions providing technical and job-
specific training tied to their disciplines. 

At every level, we conduct employee assessment and 
development in the context of both current and future role 
requirements, and deliver instructor-led and web-based 
training along with AI-based simulations and augmented 
reality/virtual reality learning capabilities. Our PATHWAY 
program helps our employees create personalized learning 
journeys, with our technical talent receiving additional 
specialized opportunities to develop knowledge and skills. 
Training programs for managers and executive leadership 
facilitate preparation for progressive roles and support our 
leadership pipeline. 

“ Applied is an exciting, forward-thinking, fast-

moving company. The company’s enthusiasm for 
developing its employees has fostered a creative 
and productive environment of professionals 
that are truly engaged with their work.”

Leixlip, Ireland

PATHWAY: Personalized 
Employee Development 
Applied Materials recognizes continuous learning and skills 
development as an essential component of growth and success, 
for both our employees and our company. Our integrated 
PATHWAY learning program helps drive that growth and 
success by empowering employees to create a personalized 
learning journey to fine-tune their existing skills and build 
capacity for the future. By enabling our employees to browse 
and select courses mapped to their role-related skills and 
development plan, and by giving recommendations for role-
based self-directed learning, PATHWAY helps enable our 
culture of continuous improvement and employee support. 

Each fiscal year, Applied employees are required to select a skill 
goal and a defined “skill journey” to enhance development in a 
specific area. In addition to taking courses through our extensive 
course catalog, employees may meet their annual requirement of 
40 learning hours through university-level courses, professional 
accreditation or continuing education workshops, and flexible 
learning opportunities such as attending conferences, reading a 
job-related book, mentoring or creating a course.

During FY22, 13,695 Applied employees completed their 
PATHWAY skill journeys and 19,142 accessed and participated 
in PATHWAY trainings, helping us achieve a participation rate of 
72% across our global workforce. Coursework in leadership and 
communication were the most popular, and we saw a significant 
year-over-year enrollment increase in problem solving and 
system engineering courses.

During our annual two-day Virtual Learning Summit in  
July 2022, more than 4,370 employees participated in 
learning challenges and talks by keynote speakers focused 
on building skills with purpose, intention, determination and 
action. This represented a 21% increase from FY21, with major 
representation from employees in Taiwan, China, Singapore, 
Korea, Japan and India.

In November 2021 we launched our first 
Pulse Survey focused entirely on employee 
engagement, asking for feedback in four key 
areas: time to effectiveness, productivity, 
talent attraction/retention, and a connected 
and inclusive culture. Survey results were 
kept confidential and only reported on in 
aggregate for team-level insights to help shape 
Applied’s strategy and build an even stronger 
organization, culture and employee experience.

Enterprise-wide actions taken in 2022 
following survey analysis included:

• Roll-out of career conversations for all 
employees, supported by a training for 
managers, with over 16,000 documented 
conversations in just six months

• Launch of our new manager forum to enhance 
manager effectiveness and educate managers 
on our global rewards philosophy and practices

• Elevation of our Culture of Inclusion efforts, 

including clarifying our goals 

P L A N E T

• Continued emphasis on employee well-being

P R O G R E S S

Many of our business units also launched 
employee development days to celebrate and 
recognize our accomplishments.

Our engagement survey helps align Applied’s 
people strategy to business outcomes 
by providing top-down and bottom-up 
actionable insights and planning at all levels 
of the organization. Enterprise-wide, fast 
turnaround of information and real-time data 
visibility enable greater transparency across 
the organization and allow us to benchmark 
results and development indexes to provide 
baseline measurement for future actions and 
initiatives. At the business unit and team 
level, managers are empowered to drive 
greater engagement across their teams, with 
personalized, actionable insights allowing 
greater precision. For employees, the clear 
connection between feedback and action 
can increase trust, transparency, a sense of 
agency in their own experience, growth and 
engagement, and a sense of inclusion. 

In February 2023, we conducted our latest 
employee engagement survey. The results will 
be detailed in next year’s sustainability report.

Employee Benefits
Investing in employee wellbeing is the core 
of our Total Rewards program, which offers 
a suite of health and wellness benefits to 
support our employees’ physical, emotional, 
social and financial health. Our plans differ 
geographically but are designed to help 
employees at work, home and anywhere 
they go. See our Applied Materials Benefits 
website for information on U.S. benefits 
including financial, insurance, health and 
wellness, and time off. Specific benefits 
offered vary by country.

2022 saw a number of significant additions 
and accomplishments in our U.S. Total 
Rewards program:

• We enhanced gender affirmation support 
benefits aligned to the updated World 
Professional Association for Transgender 
Health (WPATH) guidelines, with availability 
beginning January 1, 2023.

• We also enhanced fertility facilitation 

support effective January 1, 2023, with more 
inclusive coverage for same-sex couples and 
uncoupled and transgender employees.

• We supported student loan debt repayment 
for non-highly-compensated U.S. employees, 
with $658,815 repaid in 2022, supporting 
548 employees.

• We continued providing employee assistance 

support globally, including ten additional 
mental health sessions at our on-site health 
centers, Crossover Health sites, or virtually. 
Through Care.com, employees may access 
help finding childcare, elder care, pet walking 
or house cleaning support. 

• We offer 12 weeks of 100% paid family care

Occupational Health and Safety

Applied Materials places high priority on the safety of our 
on-site workforce, our field services engineers, our suppliers 
and our customers. We are committed to complying with or 
exceeding all regulatory requirements applicable and relevant 
to the health and safety performance of our operations, 
processes and products. 

In 2022, our on-site protocols around COVID-19 safety tracked 
the waning impacts of the pandemic in most regions. We 
continue to monitor the status of the virus in our communities, 
follow up on confirmed cases where required by state or 
country regulations, and communicate protocols to keep 
employees who are ill away from the workplace.

Throughout the year, we emphasized safety training to mitigate 
risks stemming from recent growth and turnover in our 
workforce, and we achieved positive results. Our month-long 
Global Field Safety Campaign in August 2022 reached 7,800 
Applied employees with trainings that reinforced our injury- and 
incident-free culture and key safety programs.

Find additional information on Applied’s Occupational Health 
and Safety Program here. 

Safety Targets and Performance 
Applied Materials maintains global programs and monitoring to promote a 
safety culture and safe work practices, minimize workplace risks, and support 
continuous improvement in our safety performance. We use the definitions 
set by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) for recordable, lost-time and restricted-day injuries. 
These definitions are implemented globally for data gathering and analysis, 
and we set both corporate- and site-level targets and objectives, which are 
embedded into annual performance objectives. These key safety metrics are 
made available to all business units in our safety performance dashboards. At 
the end of each year, we analyze results and reset targets for the coming year. 

Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR) 
In FY22, Applied achieved a TCIR of 0.35, beating our goal of 0.40 and 
significantly outperforming the industry benchmark of 0.60.

Health and Safety Violations 
In FY22, we received two violations worldwide, one for a non-hazardous 
waste disposal issue at our Gloucester, MA, location (no fines) and one OSHA 
machine guarding safety violation considered “other than serious” ($2,800 
fine). Both were closed with the regulatory agencies.

Safety Training Rate
For FY22, Applied Materials achieved a 97.5% 
safety training rate for relevant employees. 
Weekly safety training penetration reports, 
across all business units, are sent to all 
members of executive management as part of 
the weekly Environmental Health and Safety 
(EHS) Update Report.

Human Rights

Over the past two years, Applied Materials has taken several 
significant steps toward formalizing our commitment to 
protecting human rights wherever we do business. In 2021 we 
published our first Human Rights Statement of Principles and 
formed a cross-functional Human Rights Working Group to lead 
our Corporate Human Rights Program.

This assessment underscored that Applied Materials has 
opportunities to elevate the importance of human rights 
management. Following completion of the assessment, Applied 
commenced work on developing:

• New training on human rights and RBA requirements to 

educate Applied workers and support supply chain outreach

In 2022, we partnered with Article One Advisors to complete 
a three-phase project to proactively identify human rights risks 
associated with our operations and assess whether we are 
managing these risks effectively through our existing policies 
and processes. The assessments identified risks around:

• Non-compliance with Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) 

working hour limits

• A Responsible Manufacturing Program to operationalize 

human rights governance across our manufacturing 
operations to comply with our Human Rights Statement of 
Principles and the RBA Code of Conduct

• Internal communications to further embed human rights into 

company culture

• Forced labor in the upstream information and 

communications technology supply chain

• Supplier deficiencies in RBA assessments and resistance  

As of the publication of this report, we are taking steps to 
implement our Human Rights Statement of Principles across 
our operations and supply chain, and we look forward to sharing 
details in our next sustainability report.

NON-DISCRIMINATION POLICY 

Applied Materials is committed to providing 
a workplace that is free of discrimination, 
harassment and retaliation. We do not tolerate 
harassment based on race, color, national origin, 
ancestry, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, 
gender identity, marital status, physical 
disability, mental disability, medical condition,

Policy protects employees who have lodged 
good-faith reports of possible ethical issues 
or policy violations, or participated in any 
investigation, proceeding or hearing. The policy 
addresses conduct, complaint procedure, 
supervisory responsibilities, responsive action 
and supplemental state-specific rules.

Applied Materials invests in transforming our business to  
Make Possible a Better Future for our industry. 

As the effects of climate change continue to 
impact our lives and economy with increasing 
frequency, the demand for corporate action 
becomes more urgent. Semiconductor 
manufacturing is being recognized as a 
growing contributor to GHG emissions.1, 2

At the same time, the semiconductor industry 
is powering a digital transformation that can 
fundamentally reshape our future to be more 
sustainable, equitable and just. Big emerging 
technologies such as artificial intelligence 
(AI), Internet of Things (IoT), electric vehicles 
(EVs), and 5G/6G networks are creating 
unprecedented demand for semiconductors 
across the industry, while geopolitical 
pressure is prompting legislative action by the 
U.S. and EU to ramp up domestic production. 
As the leader in materials engineering 
solutions, we recognize the opportunity this 
presents and the responsibility it requires, and 
we are working to demonstrate sustainable 
transformation by example. 

Across our facilities, our value chain and the 
geographies in which we operate, we are doing 
our part to accelerate the transition to a low-
carbon future. In 2022, Applied experienced 
record business growth as we aggressively 
addressed a significant order backlog 
spurred by pandemic-related supply chain 
disruptions. Although our Category 11 (use 
of sold products) carbon emissions doubled 
during this period of rapid growth, we still saw 
improvements in per-wafer emissions intensity. 
This is due, in part, to changes in our product 
mix year-over-year, adjustments to our process 
recipes, and progress toward our 3x30 goals. 

We are expanding our use of renewable 
electricity, including onsite solar installations 
and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), as 
we work to reduce our Scope 2 emissions. 
Largely through our VPPA with White Mesa 
Wind, we reached our goal of being fully 
powered by renewable electricity in the U.S., 
and we are 69% of the way toward 100% 
renewable electricity globally. To help drive 
global demand for renewable electricity 
across our industry and expedite the transition 
to clean energy sources, we work with key 
customers and engage in industry coalitions 
and collaborations such as RE100 and the 
Clean Energy Buyers Alliance (CEBA). 

Since about 80% of our emissions are tied to 
customer use of Applied products, enabling 
more efficient energy consumption by our 
customers and the semiconductor industry as 
a whole is just as essential as transitioning to 
clean energy. Through innovations like those 
associated with our 3x30 goals, we are working 
to significantly reduce the total equivalent 
energy and emissions impact associated with 
our semiconductor products. In 2022, we 
set a new goal to reduce per-wafer Scope 3 
Category 11 emissions by 55% by 2030 and 
have submitted the goal for SBTi validation.

We are committed to decoupling growth from 
our carbon emissions footprint so we can 
meet soaring demand while protecting the 
planet. Through cross-industry collaborations 
like the Semiconductor Climate Consortium, 
we are engaging on policy, sharing learnings, 
and problem-solving collectively to speed 
progress for our business, our customers, our 
industry and the world.

emissions footprint by 3% from our 2019 base year.

In a year of unprecedented demand across the 
semiconductor industry, we saw our Scope 3 
Category 11 emissions (use of sold products) 
for semiconductor products nearly double 
from our 2019 baseline. Given the strong 
and increasing demand for our products, we 
anticipate this robust business growth will 
continue over the coming decade. To limit the 
environmental impacts of that growth, we are 
working toward SBTi validation of our Paris-
aligned science-based targets. Successful 
completion of these targets would encourage 
product and operational efficiencies and a 
100% global shift to renewable power in 
order to achieve a 50% absolute reduction in 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a 55% reduction 
per wafer in Scope 3 Category 11 emissions 
for semiconductor products, both by 2030 
(baseline: 2019).

SUPPORTING BIODIVERSITY 
CONSERVATION

Applied Materials understands that 
protecting biodiversity is an essential 
part of maintaining healthy ecosystems, 
protecting watersheds, and supporting a 
future in which global temperature rise 
is limited to 1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels. While we do not operate in 
biodiversity-sensitive regions or employ 
commodities that impact biodiversity, 
we nevertheless perform thorough 
environmental assessments when 
planning construction of any new real 
estate facilities and prioritize building on 
land in our existing portfolio. 

We are in the process of evaluating 
opportunities to support biodiversity 
efforts, particularly nature-based carbon-
removal projects, and will be announcing 
our participation at the appropriate time.

Scope 1 and 2 Emissions 
GHG Footprint
The largest part of our Scope 1 and 2 footprint is traceable 
to the power needs of our factories and labs, which 
represent our primary opportunity for change. In 2022, 
we completed work with energy consultant 3Degrees 
on a renewable energy strategy and roadmap that will 
expand our renewable energy portfolio to achieve our 
goal of 100% renewable electricity globally by 2030, with 
associated drops in Scope 2 emissions.

In 2022, Applied Materials’ Scope 1 and 2 market-based 
emissions totaled 139,486 metric tons of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (CO2e), representing a 3% decrease from base 
year FY19. Although we made substantial progress on 
Scope 1 and 2 reductions between FY19 and FY21, a jump 
in business production in FY22—notably, an increase in 
process gas use in our R&D labs and higher electricity 
consumption in our Asia operations—countered the 
reductions we gained from reaching 100% renewable 
electricity in the U.S. Since 2021, our consumption of 
electricity and natural gas increased by 8% and 2% 
respectively, aligning with our 5% operational footprint 
growth during the same period.

Although our consumption of process gases increased 
dramatically over 2021 (+89% year over year), the 
increase since base year 2019 was only 1%. Process gas 
emissions are driven primarily by the requirements of 
tools being tested in our R&D labs. Applied is working 
both internally and through industry groups to identify 
solutions to lower the impact of these gases through 
efficiency measures, identification of lower-impact gases, 
and better abatement technologies.

Climate Risks
Applied Materials monitors current and emerging climate-
related risks on an annual basis. Responsibility for evaluating 
company-wide risks is initiated by the ESG team and shared 
with relevant enterprise risk management (ERM) stakeholders. 
Site-specific risks are monitored and managed by Applied’s 
Business Continuity Planning (BCP) team, as well as local 
facilities teams and EHS teams. When planning new sites, we 
consider the relative climate risk of candidate sites. Our risk 
identification, mitigation and management plans help ensure 
our ability to recover quickly from climate-related events and 
effectively support our customers’ and suppliers’ operations. 

In line with recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Applied contracted a 
third party to conduct a two-year Climate Risk Assessment, 
identifying key physical risks across our global operations as 
well as transition risks and opportunities across our value chain. 
Phase 1 of the assessment, completed in 2020, gauged physical 
risk exposure across our global operations by identifying our 
highest-risk assets and operations based on various chronic and 
acute geographical climate hazard indicators. The assessment 
utilized three different Representative Concentration Pathways 
(RCPs) representing low-, moderate-, and high-risk climate 
change scenarios for 2019 (baseline), 2030, and 2050. 

Phase 2, which concluded in March 2022, provided insights 
on Applied’s projected risks associated with the transition to a 
low-carbon economy between 2025 and 2050. Benchmarked 
against our industry peers, the assessment gauges relative 
risk levels across four key areas—policy and legal, market, 
reputation and technology—in which climate risk mitigation and 
adaptation strategies may shift asset values and raise business 
and compliance costs.

To date, we have not identified any material climate-related 
risks with the potential to have a substantive financial 
or strategic impact on our business. Applied plans to re-
run a comprehensive physical and transition climate risk 
assessment in 2023.

Renewable Energy
In 2022, we achieved our goal of powering Applied’s U.S. 
operations with 100% renewable electricity and reached  
69% in our worldwide renewables rate.

In partnership with energy consultant 3Degrees, we completed 
a roadmap to help us assess current renewable energy 
opportunities across key global markets, prioritize near-
term sourcing, improve consumption forecasts, and scale 
procurement to meet demand—bringing us closer to our  
goal of 100% green power by 2030, worldwide.

Our global renewable energy strategy relies on four 
complementary approaches: 

• On-site solar power generation: Applied Materials 

maintains on-site solar generating capacity at our facilities in 
Sunnyvale, CA; Austin, TX; Singapore; Bangalore, India; and 
Xi’an, China. Combined, these arrays generated 157 MWh 
of clean power in 2022. Three additional solar projects are 
in progress: a new 5.4 MW system at our Logistics Service 
Center (LSC) in Austin, TX; a 4 MW onsite/offsite solar 
project in Rehovot, Israel; and a 700 kW onsite solar plant in 
Taiwan. The LSC array is expected to be Applied’s largest  
on-site system and the largest rooftop installation in Austin. 

• Virtual Power Purchase Agreements: Financial contracts 

with external solar, wind and other renewable energy 
generating projects reduce our Scope 2 emissions inventory 
by delivering clean power to the grid. We have a VPPA with 
the White Mesa Wind project, which began operations in 
October 2021 and was fully operational throughout 2022.

• Utility green procurement programs: We purchase 
renewable energy directly from utility providers  
in Santa Clara and San Jose, CA; Austin, TX; and  
Alzenau, Germany. 

• Renewable Energy Credits: Our White Mesa VPPA currently 

represents 58% of our total global renewable energy and 
59% of our total U.S. renewable energy portfolio. We 
also participate in green utility programs (32% of global 
portfolio) and purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs) 
(10%). Through these strategies, Applied enabled 319,180 
MWh of green power in 2022, covering all our U.S. and 69% 
of our worldwide electricity footprint — a year-over-year 
improvement of more than 37% in the U.S. and 32% globally.

the life of Applied products through refurbishment (a plus for 
circularity and reuse, but a complication for GHG accounting), 
we plan to continue to review and refine our estimates and 
assumptions. Once better data becomes available, we plan to 
add product-use emissions data from our Display and Adjacent 
Markets segment to our annual emissions reporting. In 2022, 
Display represented 5% of our total sales.

In 2022, we improved the granularity of product groups 
modeled for Category 11 and applied more specific grid 
emission factors based on the countries to which the tools 
are shipped. We also made improvements to our Scope 3 
calculations for Categories 6 (Business Travel), 7 (Employee 
Commuting), and 15 (Investments). For a complete overview  
of these updates, see our Scope 3 methodology.

Applied continues to review the methodology annually to 
refine its calculations, emissions factors, data, estimates 
and underlying assumptions, aiming to replace our use 
of Environmentally Extended Input–Output (EEIO) model 
estimates with primary data wherever possible. We will report 
any resulting changes and implications.

Scope 3 Emissions
In early 2022, we completed a 2019 Scope 3 emissions 
inventory for our semiconductor products, giving us a baseline 
from which to report our Scope 3 inventory for both FY21 and 
FY22. Our Scope 3 emissions grew substantially in 2021 and 
then nearly doubled in 2022 (from our baseline year) due 
to record-breaking production following an order backlog 
from the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing demand to 
support emerging technologies. Despite this rise, we saw 
improvements in emission intensity driven by fluctuations in 
our product mix, changes to process recipes, and progress 
toward our 3x30 objectives.

Among the 15 categories defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, 
Category 11, Use of Sold Products, continues to represent 
by far our largest share of Scope 3 emissions (78% in FY22). 
This category denotes the total emissions from all Applied 
semiconductor products sold during a reporting year, estimated 
over the average lifetime of those products (10 years, as described 
below) and includes emissions from both the technology’s energy 
draw in customer fabs and the chemicals and gases used in chip-
making processes.

Category 1, Purchased Goods and Services, is the second 
largest contributor to our Scope 3 footprint (16%), representing 
Applied’s estimated upstream supply chain emissions. This 
category includes all upstream (i.e., cradle-to-gate) emissions 
from the production of products purchased or acquired by us in 
the reporting year.

While we are in the process of developing semiconductor 
guidelines for Category 11 emissions through the Semiconductor 
Climate Consortium, we have developed our own methodology 
building on the SEMI S23 standard (related to energy, utilities 
and material use efficiency) to test and model our tools’ energy 
and process gas consumption in order to estimate product-
use emissions. For the purposes of our assessment, we include 
emissions not only from sold products but also from certain 
non-Applied ancillary and subfab equipment required for the 
tools’ operation, such as pumps, cooling systems and point-of-
use abatement systems. Our calculation assumes an average 
10-year product lifespan across all Applied tools and technologies.

BUSINESS TRAVEL EMISSIONS PLATFORM

Applied implemented a third-party business travel 
emissions platform in 2022 that will go live in 
2023, helping our company and employees identify 
opportunities to decrease emissions and drive further 
carbon savings. Calculating emissions data across air, 
hotel, train and car (rental/taxi) transportation, the 
platform will include a baseline CO2 dashboard with 
data from January 2019 through December 2021. By 
providing traveling employees with real-time, point-
of-sale information on their CO2 impacts, the platform 
can inform decisions to shift spending to better 
suppliers and more climate-friendly transportation 
options, supporting employee engagement with our 
Scope 3 emissions reduction goals.

Energy Management
Applied Materials is committed to maximizing energy 
performance and minimizing consumption through: 

• Continuously monitoring energy use and conducting 

energy audits 

• Building optimal energy efficiency into all new facility 
construction, such as through U.S. Green Building 
Council LEED certification 

• Purchasing more energy-efficient new equipment 

• Optimizing the temperature of chilled water used in 

our operations 

• Transitioning to 100% renewable electricity 

worldwide by 2030 

Applied’s total energy use grew by 7% in 2022, tracking 
growth in both demand for our products and in our real 
estate footprint (+5%). Our energy intensity fell, however, as 
measured against both revenue and employee headcount.

2022 ON-SITE ENERGY CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY PROJECTS

In 2022, energy and waste reduction efforts 
produced significant results at Applied Materials 
sites around the world. Here are some highlights:

•  At our Taiwan manufacturing facility, optimization 
of HVAC fan filter units and makeup air units for 
cleanroom operation produced energy savings of 
498,234 kWh/year.

•  In Santa Clara, CA, installation of a dedicated 

three-ton split AC unit for a commonly used room 
produced a 481,180 kWh/year savings versus 
running the entire building’s 25-ton AC system.

•  In another Santa Clara building, reprogramming 
of rooftop AC units to stage down during non-
occupancy hours and adding split HVAC units 
for some rooms resulted in a 558,450 kWh/year 
savings.

•  In Rehovot, Israel, office areas underwent a major 
internal renovation implemented in conformance 
with the Israeli Green Building Standard–renovation 
projects (ISGBC 5281), using locally sourced, low-
impact materials and energy-efficient lighting.

•  All Applied Silicon Valley sites in California 
installed Chargepoint EV charging stations, 
accounting for a reduction of 378,515 pounds of 
CO2 per year.

and reduce the amount of energy required to cool IT 
infrastructure, resulting in annual electrical savings 
of 306,200 kWh. 

•  Santa Clara Data Center: In Q1 2023, we completed 

migration of our disaster recovery solution and 
other services to the cloud and moved all remaining 
services from an inefficient data center to a modern 
data center co-location facility that utilizes Bloom 
Energy fuel cells as its primary source for powering 
IT loads. These projects resulted in a net energy 
reduction of 20kW.

•  Amsterdam Colocation Data Center: We migrated 
a Teamcenter instance to the cloud, reducing power 
from 110kW to 80kW. Retirement of Teamcenter 
equipment is expected to be complete in Q2 2023, 
resulting in a further 40kW savings.

Waste Management
Applied is committed to minimizing waste across our locations 
and logistics operations, with a special focus on non-recyclable, 
landfill-bound waste. 

Waste reduction, reuse and recycling programs are managed 
at the site level and have been successful in minimizing 
generation of paper waste, increasing reuse and recycling of 
product and packaging materials, implementing sorting of 
recyclables at point of disposal, and maximizing composting 
of organic materials from our cafeteria operations. Waste 
management targets are set for individual manufacturing sites 
based on the ISO 14001 framework and are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis and scored annually. 

In 2022, Applied increased our volume of recycled waste 
by 11% over 2021 and 56% over 2019. We also increased 
our diversion rate from landfill/incineration to 72%, up 5% 
since 2021; however, multi-year growth in our manufacturing 
activities and better data reporting have kept our current rate 
lower than in 2019.

Generation of hazardous waste rose by 5% from 2021 to 2022, 
mirroring our 5% growth in real estate footprint.

Our compost program continues to grow, but remains a 
very small percentage of our overall waste. See the Design 
for Sustainability section for information on our responsible 
product and packaging initiatives. 

Hazardous waste management: Hazardous waste accounted 
for 3% of our annual waste output in 2022. We contract with 
licensed third parties to transport waste (including hazardous 
waste) for off-site disposal, consistent with applicable laws and 
regulations. Our EHS organization provides oversight of third-
party hazardous material disposal companies and verifies that 
all disposal sites and methods meet regulatory requirements. 
We also evaluate potential vendors via the CHWMEG Facility 
Review Program, which provides environmental, operational and 
financial information on waste treatment, disposal, recycling 
and storage facilities. 

Wastewater management: Applied strives to reduce the 
negative impacts of wastewater produced by our operations, 
monitoring to ensure sufficient removal of solids and adherence 
to permitted parameters (e.g., pH and fluoride content) before 
discharge to publicly owned treatment works. Each Applied 
site is responsible for wastewater monitoring, with problems 
escalated to the site management team and applicable 
corporate staff for immediate correction.

RECYCLING AND CIRCULARITY SOLUTIONS FOR RENOVATION WASTE

During 2022 renovations at our Santa Clara 
headquarters campus, our facilities team partnered 
with Green Standards to salvage decommissioned 
furniture, equipment and other materials and 
repurpose them through charitable donation, resale 
and recycling—keeping them out of a landfill while 
generating positive local impact.

At the launch of this project in April, we set out 
to divert 100% of decommissioned materials. By 
the project’s conclusion, we’d reached that goal 
by diverting 102 tons of materials, 84% through 
recycling and 16% (worth $23,615) through 
donations to 17 community organizations, including 
seven schools. Cumulatively, these efforts resulted 
in a savings of 294 metric tons of CO2 emissions.

Water Management
In 2022, business growth caused our absolute water withdrawal 
to increase slightly (5% over 2021), but our water intensity per 
employee has declined to a current value of 0.09 (from 0.14 in 
2019) and our CDP Water score improved from C to B. 

Overall, Applied’s operations are not high-volume water 
consumers relative to our industry, but we nevertheless strive 
to optimize water use across our facilities. Ninety-five percent 
of our water use is in lab or mixed-use buildings, with our R&D 
labs accounting for our highest consumption of ultrapure water, 
followed by our manufacturing operations, routine use at our 
offices, and landscape irrigation. We are currently in the process 
of enhancing our water policy, establishing reduction targets, 
and creating water-efficiency strategies for new labs. Our water 
conservation efforts include:

• Designing water-efficient products, following best practices 
for tool design and specifications for water use outlined in 
SEMI industry requirements 

• Water recycling and reuse for non-potable applications, 

especially cooling and landscape irrigation 

• Rainwater collection at certain sites for use in landscaping or 

non-production needs

P R O G R E S S

Facilities groups are responsible for water use management at 
specific Applied sites, with oversight from the company’s EHS 
organization. Our Vice President of Global EHS is responsible 
for ensuring that water-related risks and minimization 
opportunities are assessed as appropriate. Water reduction is 
covered under our EHS policy and ISO 14001 EHSMS, which 
call for our business operations to identify opportunities, make 
continual improvements on environmental preservation and 
natural resource conservation, and meet or exceed all relevant 
regulatory requirements. 

Manufacturing and product water use: Only a few select 
types of Applied tools require ultrapure water in production 
processes. Most of our tools require cooling water, which runs 
in a closed-loop process and is negligible in terms of water 
consumption. Because of this, our focus on water has come 
through the lens of energy efficiency—for example, looking at 
hardware and software processes that reduce water flow for our 
equipment and thus the energy required to pump that water. 
As an example, clamp-on ultrasonic water flow meters can 
provide data on the velocity of liquid flowing through a pipe, 
which can then be used to calculate water volume. As part of 
our Design for Sustainability program, we communicate these 
types of optimization strategies to our largest customers, which 
collectively represent over 70% of our Scope 3 Category 11 
emissions, driving energy and water reductions.

As part of our 3x30 product efficiency modeling initiative, 
Applied is starting to gather water consumption indicators 
across all our tools in order to identify efficiency opportunities 
for specific tools and enable engagement with customers on 
future water use reduction strategies. Engagement success is 
measured through the total number of projects where efficiency 
measures are implemented across our tools, and the total 
reductions associated with such projects. 

Water risk evaluations: Using the World Resources Institute 
(WRI) Aqueduct tool, Applied Materials conducts an annual 
analysis to better understand current and future water risks, 
identify facilities located in regions with medium high, high and 
extremely high water risk across our global operations, and 
track their ongoing water use.

In 2020–21, an additional gauge of water stress risk was 
included in an assessment of physical climate risks conducted 
for Applied by Trucost, which identified top facilities that, due 
to their location, are expected to be subject to higher associated 
risks between 2020 and 2050. Facilities identified for medium 
high, high and extremely high water risk are in Xi’an, China 
(representing 67% of our total water stress withdrawal); 
Rehovot, Israel (21%); and Arizona, U.S. (9%).

Applied Materials is committed to empowering transformative, 
high-performance innovation that consumes less energy, while also 
optimizing the life of our existing materials and tools. 

We continue to drive progress toward our 
3x30 goals, reducing energy and chemical 
consumption while simultaneously 
reducing our tools’ physical footprint to 
enable cleanroom efficiencies. These goals 
contribute to our broader ambition to drive 
rapid and dramatic improvements in chip 
performance, power, area, cost and time to 
market (PPACt) across our industry. 

Traditional Moore’s Law scale is slowing, and 
the semiconductor industry must find new 
ways to increase chip performance—while also 
consuming less power. Increasingly smaller 
process nodes means there is less physical 
space available on a chip for processors. At 
the same time, the market is demanding 
significantly faster time to market for new chip 
designs. Solving this materials engineering 
challenge is urgent, and doing so will benefit 
the entire technology ecosystem. 

Applied is the PPACt Enablement Company™, 
accelerating a new PPACt playbook for our 
customers and partners and providing the 
broadest and deepest portfolio of products for 
delivering materials engineering innovations 
to market. Innovations like our Integrated 
Materials Solutions, which combine multiple 
processes with customized metrology and 
sensors in a single system, help our customers 
create faster, more efficient chips. The 

Centura® Sculpta® pattern-shaping system, 
released in early 2023, helps chipmakers 
reduce process complexity while continuing 
to shrink designs—saving energy, reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and cutting water 
use. Applied is also advancing OLED display 
technology with a device architecture that 
enables a maskless solution and high material 
utilization, which reduces energy use and 
carbon emissions associated with both 
manufacturing and lifecycle use of the final 
display product. 

As we innovate for the next generation of 
transformative technology, we’re also working to 
keep existing materials and tools in use longer, 
helping to advance a more circular economy. 

Recognizing that our supply chain plays 
an essential role in delivering on our ESG 
strategy, we created a strategic 10-year 
roadmap, Supply Chain Certification for 
Environmental and Social Sustainability 
(SuCCESS2030), to grow our suppliers’ 
ESG capabilities and performance. Three 
years into the effort, we continue to drive 
steady progress on aligning suppliers with 
our business standards, encouraging and 
supporting robust diversity and inclusion 
strategies within suppliers’ operations, and 
increasing our own percentage of spend with 
women- and minority-owned suppliers.

Center of Excellence
Within Applied’s Systems Engineering 
organization, our DfSu Center of Excellence 
(DfSu) analyzes both in-design and existing 
semiconductor product sets to identify new 
reduction opportunities for energy, water, 
waste and chemicals. Through this design 
support, the DfSu expands our product groups’ 
responsibilities to include both performance 
improvements and power reductions. By 
adding to our existing portfolio of energy-

A major highlight of our 2022 
product sustainability efforts was the 
development of EcoTwin, an integrated 
sustainability software platform 
designed specifically to reduce 
the environmental impact of wafer 
manufacturing tools and related subfab 
support equipment.

EcoTwin enables first-principles

subfab systems, combining sensor 
data from our tools with extrinsic IoT 
electrical sensors to provide a holistic 
demonstration of energy consumption 
and support optimization efforts. 
Sensors monitoring process cooling 

water, compressed dry air and house 
nitrogen can be seamlessly integrated 
to the platform, which also allows 
engineers to track and compare carbon 
impacts of different wafer recipes with 
component and chemical granularity. 

EcoTwin is currently deployed and 
being evaluated in etch tools at Applied

releasing it in three stages: EcoTwin 
Monitor visualization dashboard, 
EcoTwin Explore for quantifying 
scenarios, and EcoTwin Improve for 
autonomous adjustments.

Modeling Sustainability and Efficiency

Our proprietary modeling tools analyze 
product designs and incorporate end-user 
data to pinpoint sustainability improvement 
opportunities for legacy, in-production and 
design-stage semiconductor manufacturing 
tools. These modeling efforts support our 
3x30 goals of reducing energy use, chemical 
consumption and the equipment’s physical 
footprint to increase throughput density 
per square foot of cleanroom space. By 
modeling tools early in the design process, our 
product design engineers gain the data they 
need to reduce a tool’s projected resource 
consumption and other environmental impacts 
before the tool goes into production. Analysis 
of existing tools supports identification of 
process efficiency improvements that we 
can communicate to our customers to boost 
sustainability performance in their fabs. 

Working from a 2019 baseline of energy 
consumption for our complete line of SPG 
semiconductor products, we are able to gauge 
the impact of potential energy reduction 
strategies and inform calculation of our Scope 3 
emissions in Category 11 (use of sold products). 

The results of chemical impact analyses also allow us to 
improve process design and reduce, eliminate and/or replace 
the most negatively impactful chemicals used by our tools. 
Baselining our chemical impacts in GHG equivalents also 
contributes to our Scope 3 Category 11 assessments. 

In 2022, Applied joined international research and development 
organization imec’s Sustainable Semiconductor Technologies 
and Systems (SSTS) program to expand industry-wide models 
of environmental impact from semiconductor manufacturing 
and to develop solutions for a more sustainable industry. 
Applied is contributing to the effort by providing data to inform 
the creation of industry-level models for energy consumption in 
wafer production.

underappreciated leverage point for improving fab sustainability. By enabling systems with a smaller 
cleanroom footprint, we enable our customers to make more efficient use of shared, energy-
consuming resources such as air conditioning, piping and materials. Additional gains can be made by 
increasing the throughput of systems in a given footprint. As semiconductor manufacturers ramp up 
capacity, these improvements will make each new wave of expansion more eco-efficient.

Sustainability Report 2022Promoting the Circular Economy

Applied Materials works to 
promote the circular economy 
vision by eliminating waste 
through design, creating 
efficiencies throughout the 
product lifecycle, and employing 
materials that can be reused or 
recycled at the end of a product’s 
functional life. 

Remanufacturing Semiconductor 
Systems and Parts 
Our systems are designed to last, to support upgrades and repurposing for 
new applications, and to be easily repairable if parts fail or performance falls 
below acceptable standards. All newly manufactured parts are engineered 
for greater repairability, and we use refurbished parts whenever possible 
for repair and remanufacture, contributing to sustainability and cost-
effectiveness. 

In a cross-functional effort, new parts are identified for potential repairability 
during new product introductions. Within Applied Global Services (AGS), 
which provides equipment installation, warranty and maintenance support 
for our products, our service engineering group confirms which parts can 
be repaired. We also continually look at parts that come into contact with 
process chemicals for potential repair or cleaning/reuse solutions. 

AGS specializes in recovering parts and assemblies from our tools in the 
field and reconditioning them for reuse, thereby reducing our manufacturing 
operation’s need for virgin materials. Each recovered part goes through an 
exacting process of inspection, decontamination, refurbishment, and repair, 
and is then recertified by AGS as “like new” for reuse and recirculation, 
with a full warranty and the same service level as a new part. On average, 
40% of the parts used for servicing Applied Materials tools (under a 
service agreement) have been repaired after previous use in an Applied 
system. We are constantly improving our processes to grow that number 
by encompassing more part categories. We maintain one of the industry’s 
largest global inventories of spare parts, with recovered parts searchable 
in our inventory management system and ready to be selected for cleaning 
and repair. In 2022, Applied Materials established a European Repair Center 
in Treviso, Italy, to provide local repair and Total Kit Management® (TKM) 
capabilities to support our European customer base.

the impacts and trade-offs of refurbishment and 
reuse versus a business-as-usual lifecycle. For 
this initial screening, only one device—a 0041-
75950 electrostatic chuck—was assessed based 
on a set of assumptions that included source of 
raw materials (China), source of components 
(Taiwan), assembly at Applied Materials 
locations, distribution by truck (domestic) and 
plane (international), and end-of-life treatment 
(100% of parts sent to landfill). The assessment 
yielded the following results:

• Refurbishing the part leads to a significantly 
lower carbon footprint (34% for one cycle 
and 50% for three cycles) compared with 
traditional end-of-life for a single-use part. 

• Impacts from material production drive the 
difference in carbon footprint, due to the 
reduced number of original parts needed to 
return a refurbished part to service. 

• Transportation/distribution accounts for 99% 
of the carbon impacts of a refurbished part.

The results show that refurbishing parts 
provides an environmental advantage in 
reduced carbon footprint when compared 
with current end-of-life disposal of single-use 
parts. To further optimize the refurbishing 
process, we may consider opportunities to 
use marine versus air freight for international 
transportation and avoid overseas transport 
entirely through investment in local 
refurbishing locations.

Enabling Recycling of Flexible Packaging 
At Applied’s Flexible Technology Group business unit in Germany, our sales, business 
development and design functions work with customers to create new solutions for 
increasing the recyclability of food packaging materials. Spurred by impending regulatory 
targets for reducing packaging waste, companies are committing to a full transition to 
biodegradable, recyclable or renewable materials within the decade, and leveraging 
Applied’s expertise with roll-to-roll vacuum coating systems to help them get there. 

The focus of this work is using our tools to create single-polymer products (e.g., all-
polypropylene pouches) as an alternative to multilayered aluminum-and-polymer 
films, making flexible food packaging easier to sort and recycle. 

2022 highlights of the group’s work included:

• Launching a project with Mitsui Chemical to create a paper barrier coating able to 

protect food from contamination, spoilage and leakage.

• Continuing to work with a multinational food packaging and processing company to 
reduce the material mix in aseptic cartons to make them more recyclable, leading 
toward customer trials in 2023. 

• Showing the capability of our equipment to run and achieve exceptional barrier on 
some new, more recyclable substrates, including MDOPE and BOPE (which enable 
all-polyethylene flexible packaging structures) and PEF, a high-performance plant-
based polymer that is both recyclable and degradable. 

• Working with partners to launch an open-source all-polypropylene recyclable retort 
solution that eliminates aluminum foil from the structure, potentially allowing more 
converters to compete in this fast-growing food packaging application.

• Proving the superior robustness of HAD AlOx to reactive AlOx through converting 

processes. A further step will show how eliminating a secondary topcoating 
process can reduce energy and cost and improve the recyclability of oxide-coated 
flexible packaging.

• Collaborating with other members of the Circular Economy for Flexible Packaging 

(CEFLEX) initiative on new solutions for mono-material household flexible packaging 
and improved recyclability solutions for multi-layer packaging. In 2022, our studies 
showing that oxide and aluminum depositions on plastic films do not significantly 
affect their mechanical recyclability led to new guidelines that accept vacuum 
deposition products in flexible packaging recycling streams.

Building a Circular Economy for Flexible Packaging 
Applied Materials is a member of Circular Economy for Flexible Packaging (CEFLEX), a 
collaborative initiative representing the full value chain of the flexible packaging industry. 

CEFLEX stakeholders have endorsed a five-step roadmap to building a circular economy for 
flexible packaging and collaborated on detailed guidelines that give clarity on redesigning to 
mono-material packaging and eliminating waste through innovation. With major consumer 
products companies and plastics producers signing on to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s 
Global Commitment to develop a circular economy for plastics, CEFLEX and its stakeholders 
are innovating new solutions to allow the redesign of consumer household flexible packaging to 
mono-materials without loss in functionality.

Product Safety

Supply Chain Responsibility

Applied Materials develops and implements comprehensive product design, manufacturing, 
labeling and testing policies and programs to ensure our products are safe to use and comply  
with applicable legal requirements and industry standards and guidelines. Third-party 
assessments validate that our products meet applicable safety requirements.

We follow relevant country- and region-specific 
requirements. For example, products distributed in China 
are marked with a mandatory China RoHS label to comply 
with the administrative measure on the control of pollution 
from electronic information products. Products sold in the 
European Union comply with regional manufacturing and 
labeling requirements, including the CE mark affirming 
conformity with European essential health and safety 
requirements. Products sold in the UK bear the similar 
UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) mark. 

Applied Materials products are designed and engineered to 
minimize safety risks to the end user’s personnel and protect 
the end user’s facilities and the environment. Any residual 

risks must be below a minimum acceptable level when the 
products are operated, maintained and serviced in accordance 
with instructions and other information provided to the 
user. Our Product Safety group partners with other company 
functions to oversee the design of products and services, 
monitors their safety during the product’s lifecycle, and drives 
compliance with our product safety policy and procedures. 

Our risk assessment process follows the applicable 
SEMI S10 Safety Guideline for Risk Assessment and Risk 
Evaluation Process on identifying, estimating and evaluating 
the lifecycle risks of semiconductor equipment beginning 
with the product design and manufacturing process and 
continuing through its use.

DESIGN FOR SAFETY

In 2022, Applied enhanced our Product Safety 
program by adding Design for Safety (DfSafety) 
requirements to our Product Development 
Process (PDP) for all product lines. These 
enhancements include performing safety FMECAs 
(Failure Mode, Effects & Criticality Analysis) and 
reliability FMECAs and enhancing our design 
process around hardware and software interlocks. 
We also incorporated a new, companywide 
Community of Practice (CoP) forum for all design 
organizations in Applied to discuss and give 
additional visibility to product safety issues.

Supply Chain Responsibility

• Supplier responsibility, engagement 

• Supplier diversity and inclusion: Mirroring 

and assessment: Applied strives to be 
a partner to our suppliers, providing 
resources, guidelines, tools and trainings 
to build capacity on advancing sustainable 
practices. We also support our suppliers 
and sub-tier suppliers in their efforts to 
conform to the Responsible Business 
Alliance (RBA) code of conduct. From this 
baseline, we can better gauge progress 
using RBA assessments and audits. 

our own inclusion and diversity journey, 
Applied’s SuCCESS2030 goals include 
promoting development of robust diversity 
strategies throughout our supply chain. Our 
near-term supplier diversity targets include 
increased representation of women and other 
underrepresented groups and increased 
percentage spend with women- and 
minority-owned businesses, all by 2024. We 
are also working with our trade associations 
to significantly grow the pipeline of diverse 
talent available to the industry by 2030. 

We continued to advance our Supply Chain Certification for Environmental and Social 
Sustainability (SuCCESS 2030) program, Applied’s 10-year roadmap for strengthening our 
ESG supply chain strategy for our semiconductor and display businesses. This effort builds on 
our foundation of supporting ethical labor practices, environmentally responsible operations, 
responsible minerals sourcing, and international human rights standards. Under SuCCESS2030, 
our assessments of supplier performance and capabilities require shared commitments across 
core ESG focus areas, most of which include defined performance targets. 

SuCCESS2030 is managed through our SuCCESS2030 Office, which oversees metrics and 
compliance audits and conducts training and coordination with participating suppliers. Across 
our operations, we conduct pilot programs to test new efficiency and waste-reduction processes, 
with the intention of sharing key learnings with our supplier partners and magnifying positive 
impacts across the industry. 

Efforts to explore intermodal shipping alternatives to air freight as part of SuCCESS2030 were 
suspended in 2022 after proving to represent an immaterially small fraction of our overall emissions.

• Packaging: Our precision tools and 
products require carefully designed 
packaging to avoid damage during 
transport, and we are continuously 
exploring strategies to reduce packaging 
waste, including redesigning cases and 
crates for reuse, using recyclable material 
such as corrugated fiberboard for boxes, 
and doing testing and measurement to 
gauge the feasibility of reducing virgin 
materials usage. 

• Wastewater: Though our own operations 
are neither water-intensive nor major 
emitters of wastewater, we recognize 
the need to reduce our industry’s large 
footprint in both areas. We have piloted a 
process of pre-treating metal surfaces for 
rust protection using zinc oxide rather than 
phosphates (which can damage aquatic 
systems when released in wastewater), and 
are looking to scale rollout to all suppliers 
that possess the requisite capabilities.

Supplier Engagement, Training 
and Assessment
SuCCESS2030 encompasses a series of best practices for 
building a more sustainable business, society and planet. 
As we raise the bar, we are also building our suppliers’ 
competencies to reach it.

Contract Obligations 
Applied’s Supplier ESG Requirements document is 
incorporated into our Global Supplier Agreements and other 
agreements with direct suppliers. These requirements are also 
included in the terms and conditions for logistics suppliers and 
all purchase order transactions, and are enumerated in our 
most commonly used agreements for indirect services.  
As applicable, these require Applied’s suppliers to: 

• Implement Applied’s Standards of Business Conduct and the 

RBA Code of Conduct in their own operations and ensure RBA 
code compliance among their sub-tier suppliers 

• Comply with our Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy and 

meet related statutory and regulatory requirements 

• Meet Applied’s other ESG requirements in their own 

operations and ensure compliance among their sub-tier 
suppliers 

• Comply with Applied’s Environmental Health and Safety 

Policy and “any applicable environmental, health or safety law, 
rule, regulation, order, decree or ordinance” 

• Comply with Applied’s minimum product EHS requirements 

• Provide requested information to enable Applied’s compliance 
with material content restriction regulations, including but not 
limited to REACH (EC number 1907/2006) and the U.S. Toxic 
Substances Control Act 

• Comply with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act 
of 2010, addressing the risk of slavery and human trafficking 
in supply chains 

Supplier Monitoring and Engagement
Applied Materials employs a metrics-based approach 
to assessing supply chain ESG risks and reflects these 
assessments in our supplier scorecards. To secure baseline 
data, we require subsets of our suppliers (as applicable) to: 

• Complete annual self-assessment questionnaires to measure 
their conformance to the RBA Code of Conduct (top 80% 
of direct suppliers by spend and 10% of high-risk indirect 
suppliers, plus some small suppliers in higher-risk countries) 

• Complete an RBA Environmental Survey to provide basic data 
on GHG emissions, energy use, water withdrawal and waste 
generation, plus qualitative data on reduction targets and 
efforts (top 80% of direct suppliers by spend)

To best assess our suppliers’ compliance with local laws related 
to labor and human rights, EHS, management systems and ethics, 
we conduct third-party audits to the RBA audit protocol, which 
includes principles from the UN Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights, the ILO Core Labor Standards, and other 
international guidelines. While many companies opted for remote 
audits in 2022 to accommodate pandemic protocols, we felt 
the need to conduct worker interviews in person to uphold audit 
integrity. To increase scheduling flexibility of these interviews and 
accommodate COVID shutdowns, we managed the scheduling 
with the audit firms ourselves. All other aspects of our Customer 
Managed Audit process continued to follow the RBA VAP 
guidelines, including having a fourth-party quality check. Click 
here for more information on the RBA audit guidelines.

Sustainability Report 2022Capacity Building
We want working with Applied to be a partnership, with 
collaboration driving benefits to all parties. In 2022, we began 
offering a structured program of webinars, trainings and 
assistance to help our suppliers close any gaps across our  
ESG focus areas. These included:

• Weekly live webinars discussing key area of ESG focus 

• Online training on Applied Materials Supply Chain ESG 

Requirements 

• Training through the RBA e-Learning Academy and RBA 

workshops 

• Ability to contract for social responsibility and sustainability 

assistance from a consultant at pre-negotiated rates

Our Applied commodity business managers are required to 
complete these trainings, assuring that the people who engage most 
frequently with our suppliers can knowledgeably communicate the 
business benefits of our sustainability expectations.

Our commitment to protecting human rights wherever we do 
business is detailed in the policies and statements listed on 
page 44. We communicate our human rights commitments and 
requirements clearly to our supply chain and business partners 
to help ensure compliance with our expectations around 
humane treatment of the workforce and enforce the prohibition 

of forced and bonded labor. We conduct due diligence on 
human rights risk in our supply chain and flag zero-tolerance 
issues in our supplier scorecards. 

View our Human Rights Statement of Principles here.

In 2022, a three-phase project led by U.S.-based Article One 
Advisors to identify human rights risks associated with our 
operations pinpointed risks of forced labor in our upstream 
information and communications technology supply chain. 

GHG Scope 3 Supplier Survey
To improve our Scope 3 emissions calculations in the 
future, we initiated a survey in 2022 of 102 top suppliers. 
Questions gauged their own Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
and the maturity of their GHG reduction plans and goals. 
Suppliers were provided webinar training and one-on-one 
support to better understand how to measure and track 
their emissions and energy use. Applied plans to scale this 
effort to more suppliers in coming years.

In FY22, we conducted 24 supplier-focused webinars 
across two time zones, featuring internal and external 
speakers discussing key areas of ESG focus.

PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN OUR 
SUPPLY CHAIN 

Applied Materials is unequivocally committed 
to protecting human rights and conducting 
business in an ethical and responsible manner 
around the world. We condemn and are 
committed to ending forced and bonded labor 
in all its forms, including child labor, indentured 
labor, slavery and human trafficking. 

Risk Assessment
Applied uses the RBA Risk Assessment Model to conduct due 
diligence around supply chain sustainability. We begin the 
assessment process by compiling a list of all supplier sites in 
the top 80% of spend and high-risk sites in the top 95%. “High 
risk” was defined using the RBA Country Risk Assessment 
Tool, R1, which classifies country risk as low, medium, high and 
extreme based on indices of governance, human rights and 
conflict risk. Other risks we considered included prevalence 
of foreign migrant workers, potential risks discovered in our 
targeted working conditions audit (embedded in our Applied 
supplier quality audits), suppliers flagged in the media for poor 
working conditions, and others.

Approximately half of our planned audits were conducted in 
FY22, with the remainder scheduled for FY23. In 2023, we will 
also launch our first RBA risk assessment audits for selected 
tier 2 suppliers.

Remediation
Directly, or through our third-party consulting partner, 
we work with suppliers identified as posing ESG risks to 
answer any questions about the RBA audit protocol and to 
create corrective action plans. Our suppliers are required 
to close out all priority and major risk findings within the 
suggested RBA timeline. In 2022, exceptions were made to 
accommodate COVID shutdowns.

Responsible Minerals Sourcing
Applied Materials is committed to the responsible sourcing of minerals used in 
our products.

Key to this commitment is our policy around the sourcing of tantalum, tin, 
tungsten and gold, commonly referred to as 3TG or conflict minerals for their 
frequent origin in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining 
countries, and other conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs). Since 
2019, Applied Materials has retained a third-party service provider to assist 
in conducting outreach to suppliers regarding their use of 3TG and evaluating 
their responses.

Our commitment to improving transparency within the 3TG supply chain 
includes direct smelter engagement. Our SuCCESS2030 team works directly 
with 17 smelters or refiners to ensure their continued participation in the 
RMI Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) program. Additionally, 
our SuCCESS2030 lead is the current co-chair of the Responsible Minerals 
Initiative Smelter Engagement Team (RMI SET), on which three Applied 
employees serve in a voluntary capacity. Applied is helping to set direction 
and guide smelter engagement through increased interest and scrutiny 
regarding responsible minerals.

For more information about our 3TG due diligence, please refer to our 
Conflict Minerals Report.

Sustainability Report 2022Packaging Reduction and Reuse

Our precision products require carefully designed packaging 
to avoid damage from shock and vibration during transport. 
Our Design for Distribution task force plans and develops 
smarter packaging strategies that meet those demands while 
improving sustainability via materials reduction, improved 
recyclability and reusability.

In 2022, greater than 70% of our packaging materials were 
made from recyclable materials (polyethylene, polypropylene, 
corrugated fiberboard, steel and wood), many of which are 
also reusable. For supplier-sourced packaging, we maintain 
specifications that prohibit the use of certain packaging 
materials (including polystyrene) and are in the process of 
rolling out requirements for suppliers to report materials 
data, improving our ability to track our packaging’s recyclable 
content. We are developing processes to track and enforce 
compliance with those specifications.

Ongoing initiatives are detailed below: 

Hybrid Crate Design 
For lighter product shipments, we employ hybrid crates that 
pair a wooden base with a corrugated kraft board top and full 
moisture-barrier bagging inside. Offering a 50% reduction 
in packaging weight, these designs save the equivalent of 
3,917 trees annually, trim transport emissions and packaging 
material cost, ease recycling, and increase safety for freight 
handlers. Use of hybrid crates in 2022 saved $1 million in 
materials and reduced wood weight by 900,000 pounds.

Lighter Polyethylene Bags 
To save materials, we are moving from 6 mil to 4 mil thickness 
for low-density cleanroom polyethylene (LDPE) bags in our 
Austin and Singapore manufacturing operations. In 2022, we 
achieved an approximate 33% reduction in materials, avoiding 
101,000 pounds of plastic. For 2023, we are working to assure 
that all bags achieve 4 mil thickness or less, thereby avoiding 
215,000 pounds of plastic.

“Just Strong Enough” Crates 
Where earlier wooden crate designs tended to be overbuilt 
for most use cases, our new, lighter crates are matched to the 
precise needs of individual products. In 2022, this strategy 
saved some 956,000 pounds of wooden crate materials. 

Reusable Packaging 
A collaborative effort between our packaging, logistics, supply 
chain and quality teams and our crating vendor is working on 
a reuse ROI and sustainable process for returning and reusing 
crates sent to Applied’s factories by one of our contract 
manufacturers.

Reusable Packaging Labels 
Labels communicate to the end user that our packaging is 
reusable and must not be discarded. 

Waste Reduction 
To keep our packaging out of landfills, Applied prohibits the use 
of non-recyclable and environmentally burdening materials such 
as polystyrene, PVC and toxic foams.

Packaging ESG Dashboard
An in-progress initiative is using existing shipment management 
systems (SMS) and SAP systems to develop measurement 
dashboards detailing our packaging’s ESG impact. 

“No Crate Needed” Delivery
Our Tainan Manufacturing Center factory in Taiwan is reducing 
the use of packing crates altogether by trucking products 
directly to local customers.

MATCHING SOLUTIONS TO NEED IN OUR 
PACKAGING ECOSYSTEM

Having real-world impact on packaging waste 
requires real-world insight—into how much 
protection individual products need, where we’re 
shipping them, and what the capacities are for 
recycling and reuse in those locations. Then, we 
design the most resource-efficient packaging 
and processes to match.

PILOTING LOWER-IMPACT POU PACKAGING

Common point-of-use (POU) packaging, used 
for interplant handling of fragile parts into 
cleanrooms, is die-cut virgin polyethylene 
foam inserts placed in a polypropylene plastic 
corrugated box. To reduce environmental 
impacts, we are working to replace this plastic 
with a solution that combines the box and foam 
into a single 100% recycled polyethylene pack. 
We have begun piloting this solution with select 
high-volume repairable parts for the repair 
return cycle, with completion of the pilot run 
expected in 2023.

Supplier Diversity
To broaden the impact of our inclusion and diversity commitment, Applied 
Materials works to build diversity in our supply chain, both through onboarding 
women- and minority-owned suppliers and through encouraging equitable hiring 
practices across our supply base. 

Our supplier diversity program is one of the main pillars of our SuCCESS2030 
initiative, and in 2022 we met our goal of increasing diverse spend to 2.5% of 
our total global supplier spend, achieving $462 million spending with certified 
diverse suppliers. For 2023, we’re seeking to raise that number past $500 
million. Our goal is to reach $1 billion in diverse spend by 2027 by setting goals 
for senior supply chain executives, continuing our visits to potential diverse 
suppliers, increasing our involvement in capacity building for diverse suppliers, 
and integrating more inclusive recruiting and onboarding practices for potential 
suppliers. We will also work toward further embedding supplier diversity into our 
corporate strategy and culture. 

Beyond pure spend, we also partner with applicable existing suppliers to pursue their 
diversity certifications through the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council 
(WBENC) and the National Minority Supplier Diversity Council (NMSDC). To 
achieve local impact, we are exploring community educational initiatives in FY23 to 
boost diverse-owned companies with potential to join the semiconductor industry.

DEFINING DIVERSITY

Applied Materials’ diverse suppliers must be certified by 
a third-party auditor as being at least 51% diverse owned, 
controlled and operated by U.S. minorities (African-American/
Black, Hispanic/Latino, Native American, Asian-Pacific 
American, Asian-Indian American), women, minority women, 
LGBTQ+, persons with disabilities, veterans or service-
disabled veterans. Applied Materials also tracks additional 
diverse suppliers who could potentially be registered as 
diverse if they proceed with certification.

As a founding member of SEMI’s Manufacturing Ownership 
Diversity (MOD) working group, Applied Materials is 
working to provide best practices for supplier diversity in the 
semiconductor industry.

Assurance 
standard and 
level of 
assurance  

We performed a limited assurance engagement, in accordance with the International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised) ‘Assurance Engagements 
other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information’ issued by the 
International Auditing and Standards Board.  

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing 
from and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement and 
consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is 
substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable 
assurance engagement been performed. 

Respective 
responsibilities 

Applied Materials is responsible for preparing the Report and for the collection and 
presentation of the information within it, and for the designing, implementing and 
maintaining of internal controls relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
information in scope. 

ERM CVS’ responsibility is to provide conclusions to Applied Materials on the agreed 
scope based on our engagement terms with Applied Materials, the assurance activities 
performed and exercising our professional judgement. We accept no responsibility, and 
deny any liability, to any party other than Applied Materials for the conclusions we have 
reached.  

Our conclusion 
Based on our activities, as described below, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the 2021 and 
2022 data and information for the disclosures listed under ‘Scope of our Engagement’ above are not fairly 
presented in the Report, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria. 

Our assurance activities   
Considering the level of assurance and our assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the information in 
scope a multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists performed a range of procedures that 
included, but was not restricted to, the following:   

•  Assessing the appropriateness of the reporting criteria for the information in scope.   
• 
• 

Interviews with management representatives responsible for managing the selected issues. 

Interviews with relevant staff to understand and evaluate the relevant management systems and 
processes (including internal review and control processes) used for collecting and reporting the 
selected disclosures. 

•  Conducting tests of the controls on data management and reporting. 
•  A review at corporate level of a sample of qualitative and quantitative evidence supporting the reported 

information for each of the metrics in scope. 

•  An analytical review of the year-end data submitted by all locations included in the consolidated 2022 
group data for the selected disclosures which included testing the completeness and mathematical 
accuracy of conversions and calculations, and consolidation in line with the stated reporting boundary. 
•  Four visits to Applied Materials facilities, two in-person visits in the United States (Gloucester Campus, 
Massachusetts and Scott Campus, California) and two virtual visits, one in the United States (Kalispell, 
Montana) and one in India (International Technology Park Bangalore), to review source data and local 
reporting systems and controls.    

•  Confirming conversion and emission factors and assumptions used.  
•  Evaluation of the restatement process for 2021 environmental data to adjust to fiscal year timeline and 
updates to calculations methodologies, including integrity of calculation workbooks through review and 
recalculation and underlying or external references used to determine updates to methodologies.  

•  Reviewing the presentation of information relevant to the scope of our work in the Report to ensure 

consistency with our findings. 

The limitations of our engagement

Sustainability Report 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Semiconductors are foundational to the technologies that play an ever increasing role in our lives, transforming the global economy and enabling discoveries to help address some of humankind’s greatest challenges.

Applied Materials is committed to working across the semiconductor ecosystem to drive advances that can enable a better future for everyone.

The technologies that power our world the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and artificial intelligence (AI) are evolving at an unprecedented rate.

Exponential growth in data generation is driving the need for dramatic improvements in the power, performance, area, cost and time to market (PPACt) of next generation semiconductor devices.

As the PPACt Enablement Company , Applied is collaborating broadly to accelerate our customers’ technology roadmaps.

Our broad and deep capabilities encompass the ability to create, shape, remove, modify and analyze advanced materials at an atomic level and on an industrial scale.

As we bring transformative new innovations to market, we are also working closely with our customers to minimize our environmental impact by reducing our products’ energy, water and carbon emissions.

For example, our new Centura Sculpta patterning system can reduce per wafer manufacturing costs, water use and carbon emissions compared to existing processes.

This kind of innovation not only drives PPACt for our customers, it also encourages a more sustainable innovation model throughout our industry.

This is the fundamental principle of our 1X 100X 10,000X framework, which reflects the impacts of environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts within our operations, with our suppliers and customers, and on the global electronics ecosystem.

We are committed to minimizing our own operational impact (1X), reducing the environmental impact of our value chain through our Supply Chain Certification for Environmental and Social Sustainability (SuCCESS2030) roadmap and 3x30 product improvements (100X), and accelerating the commercialization of next generation semiconductors (10,000X).

As you’ll read in this 2022 Sustainability Report, Applied Materials is driving an aggressive 10 year ESG roadmap while managing record setting business growth, supply chain challenges, ongoing pandemic related restrictions, and a changing macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape.

We continue to invest in building a diverse and inclusive talent pipeline, and in Applied’s fiscal 2022 played an active leadership role in advocating for the successful passage of the U.S.

These types of actions ensure inclusion remains at the center of our culture and better position us to scale our global operations in the future.

In the U.S., Applied advocated for passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides a catalyst for the industry to accelerate investments to build more robust supply chains, speed up innovation and create thousands of new jobs.

Our Chief Technology Officer, Om Nalamasu, serves on the Industrial Advisory Committee of CHIPS for America, giving us a seat at the table to promote fair, equitable and sustainable implementation of this policy.

Over the past year, we further strengthened our commitment to attract and retain the best talent and cultivate a Culture of Inclusion (COI).

We made progress against our goals to increase the representation of women at Applied globally and underrepresented minorities (URMs) in our U.S. workforce.

We reached a key milestone in our transition to a low carbon future by achieving 100% renewable electricity in our U.S. operations and 69% globally.

We set a science based Scope 3 carbon emissions reduction goal, which awaits validation from the Science Based Targets initiative.

Even as we celebrate this progress, we challenge ourselves to do more and do it faster.

As a result of business growth, our Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased 17% over the course of last year.

While the intensity of those emissions declined due to our 3x30 product efficiency program, we have redoubled our efforts to decouple business growth from emissions.

As I reflect on recent history, I am more convinced than ever that there is no industry better positioned than ours to lead the transition to a more sustainable and inclusive future.

I am inspired by the passion, commitment and solutions driven mindset of our employees, customers and partners.

Together, we’ve shown that challenges create opportunities for radical innovation.

Key Highlights Created a DEI Engine to accelerate our Culture of Inclusion.

Set bold 2030 goals to increase representation of women and URMs.

Set science based Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions reduction targets, with Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validation expected in 2023.

Reached 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. and 69% globally.

Promoted early and active business and industry support for successful passage of the U.S.

Joined the RE100 global corporate renewable energy initiative.

Developed the Centura Sculpta patterning system, realizing energy savings of more than 15 kWh per wafer and water savings of approximately 15 liters per wafer.

Advocated for passage of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, and for its fair and equitable implementation.

Became a founding member of the Semiconductor Climate Consortium working to decarbonize the semi value chain, with a seat on its Governing Council.

Began exploring new partnerships with our customers and customers’ customers across the value chain to reduce the impact of electronics globally.

Joined the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (imec) Sustainable.

Additional Accomplishments Awarded more than 11.2 million in Applied Materials Foundation grants and direct corporate contributions to strengthen communities, including 230,000 for Ukraine humanitarian relief.

Average per wafer energy use decreased ahead of schedule, in part due to changes in the mix of products sold.

While we expect the reduction rate to slow, we are on track to meet or exceed the 3x30 target.

The Design for Sustainability Center of Excellence (DfSu) team and its engineering partners in the product business units are pursuing multiple development projects that will significantly reduce chemical impact.

Some of these initiatives are expected to be multi year efforts, but we are on track to meet or exceed the 3x30 target.

Footprint reduction to date is largely the result of productivity improvements in existing tool architectures.

As new product architectures begin volume shipments to customers, the footprint will be further reduced and is expected to meet or exceed the 3x30 target.

Applied Materials is the leader in materials engineering solutions used to produce virtually every new chip and advanced display in the world.

Our expertise in modifying materials at atomic levels and on an industrial scale enables customers to transform possibilities into reality.

Our unique industry position comes with tremendous responsibility to our employees, customers and society.

We are committed to working across the technology ecosystem to drive critical advances that Make Possible a Better Future for everyone.

Guided by our vision and ambition to Make Possible a Better Future, we focus on how we can use our technology and people to strengthen our industry, improve our communities and enable leading innovation all with the lowest possible environmental footprint.

Our 1X 100X 10,000X ESG framework considers the social and environmental impacts of our direct operations (1X) how we design solutions to address our industry’s impact, including that of our customers and suppliers (100X) and how our technology can be used in innovation to advance sustainability and equity on a global scale (10,000X). Our framework is underpinned by aggressive environmental and social impact goals to hold us accountable for progress.

We conduct regular corporate responsibility materiality assessments to help us identify the ESG issues most important to our stakeholders and determine where we may achieve the most significant progress to Make Possible a Better Future.

Insights for the assessment are gathered from key stakeholders, including customers, investors, employees, suppliers, policy makers, regulators, media, industry groups and peers.

In 2021, Applied updated its materiality assessment using the Datamaran platform.

We repeated this assessment in 2022 to revalidate our focus on the most relevant ESG issues.

The 2022 materiality assessment revealed no significant changes in ESG issues or prioritization mapping compared with 2021.

However, we did see minor shifts in issue prioritization year over year when viewed through a double materiality lens.

Double materiality assesses the ESG factors likely to affect our business (e.g., financial impacts), as well as factors that our activities may affect, both positively and negatively.

This report discusses all issues identified as critical in the materiality matrix.

Since issue prioritization may shift based on changing strategic impact for Applied and our stakeholders, we will continue conducting new materiality assessments on an a biannual cadence.

The terms material and materiality as used in this report and in the corporate social responsibility materiality assessment are different than those terms as used in the context of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Issues deemed material for the purposes of this report may not be deemed material for SEC reporting purposes.

Leading with purpose is at the core of our vision to Make Possible a Better Future, informing our priorities, guiding our actions, and directing how we invest in our communities.

This is more than our responsibility as a good corporate citizen.

It’s about protecting our brand reputation, attracting the best talent, building operational efficiency and resiliency, and ensuring the long term sustainability of our company and industry.

Leading with purpose means a relentless commitment to safeguarding our customers, employees, suppliers and trusted business partners from new and emerging threats to their privacy and to the security of their data and intellectual property (IP).

It means promoting and influencing public policies that impact our employees and company, our customers and their customers, and the semiconductor industry as a whole.

It’s about investing in the stability and vitality of communities where we operate to truly Make Possible a Better Future for all the generations that follow.

At Applied, we embrace our responsibility and opportunity to drive significant and lasting impact.

See our Corporate Governance documents for additional details about our Standards of Business Conduct and governance structures, and our Applied Ethics Helpline for mechanisms to report ethics concerns.

Standards of Business Conduct Applied Materials’ Standards of Business Conduct (SBC) communicate our values, set expectations for our global workforce and network of trusted partners, and promote the highest ethical standards in our interactions with customers, suppliers, colleagues, communities and other stakeholders.

We designed the SBC to foster trust in management’s commitment to our values, empower employees to speak up without fear of retaliation, and provide clear guidance about risks, laws, company policies and reporting channels.

To promote compliance, we made both the SBC and our SBC website significantly more user friendly: shortening the text, adding interactive navigation controls, and linking to policies, tools and other helpful resources.

To enable real time data analytics and insights regarding compliance with our SBC, we maintain digitized workflows that track GMET approvals, conflict of interest disclosures, corporate donations approval requests and third party due diligence approvals.

We are releasing a companion set of updated standards for our business partners.

Responsible Business Alliance Code of Conduct Applied Materials is a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), the world’s largest industry coalition dedicated to social responsibility in global supply chains.

In 2022, we began work on a Responsible Manufacturing Program to better monitor our compliance with the RBA Code of Conduct, which provides standards related to labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems, including responsible minerals sourcing.

We also set clear expectations for social responsibility in our own supply chain, requiring our vendors and suppliers to comply with both our own Standards and the RBA Code of Conduct.

In 2022, 98% of Applied’s 33,306 employees completed our updated Standards of Business Conduct course.

Practical Advice and Training Applied Materials provides all our employees with training and reinforcement to support their ongoing obligations around ethics and compliance.

We assign newly hired employees an SBC training and certification course, which was refreshed in 2022 to align with our updated standards.

Like the new standards, the SBC training is offered in 14 languages, covering our policies on conflicts of interest, IP protection, anti corruption, gifts, insider trading, trade compliance, supplier selection and treatment, speaking up and non retaliation.

Employees renew their training and certification to the Standards annually.

To meet the demands of specific roles and regions, employees may also receive ongoing training on specific E C topics.

In 2022, for example, we provided 52 live, in person training sessions on our Global Anti Corruption Policy and GMET Policy.

Sent to all Applied employees, the survey included 69 questions designed to gauge perceptions around eight E C categories, with additional questions on employee expectations and demographics.

Results were broken down by operating regions, business groups, business function and job hierarchy.

The survey achieved a response rate above benchmark, with responses revealing improved employee perceptions in most areas compared to our 2020 survey and equal or more favorable scores in 6 of 8 categories compared to the benchmark, as well as very high awareness related to company expectations around confidential information and intellectual property protection.

The survey revealed opportunities for improvement in several areas, including building skills for managing high pressure situations.

We are focusing our 2023 Responsibility and Integrity Week and related 2023 campaigns on ethical decision making when under pressure and are reinforcing our speak up culture through localized content that resonates with Applied’s diverse geographic and cultural footprint.

I take great satisfaction in knowing that the problems I solve today can help solve a much bigger problem for someone in a different part of the world.

Our annual Responsibility and Integrity Week showcases Applied’s values in action, with events designed to raise awareness of key themes, resources and best practices.

During our 2022 event, 52 E C related topics were posted to our Inside Compliance social media channel, achieving 44,982 views.

Applied Materials participates in efforts to inform policymakers about issues and challenges critical to our company, our customers and our customers’ customers, typically via meetings, hearings and trade association advocacy efforts.

Our general policy focus areas include technology regulation, international trade, research and development (R D), human resources and labor, and sustainability.

Efforts within these areas include advocating for immigration reform that embraces the contributions of immigrants to the U.S. economy advocating for fairness, diversity and inclusion, including LGBTQ rights and working on policies, partnerships and R D incentives to develop and advance next generation technologies.

U.S. semiconductor funding: We successfully advocated for the CHIPS Act that provided 52.7 billion for grants to revitalize the U.S. position in semiconductor research, development and manufacturing, including workforce development.

Federal tax credit: We were among a small number of companies leading efforts to include and expand the investment tax credit that had been removed when CHIPS programs were authorized as part of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act.

The tax credit applies to qualifying investments in facilities for manufacturing semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

Since passage of the CHIPS Act, Applied has been engaging with the administration and Congress to ensure its rollout is implemented fairly and equitably across the supply chain.

In September 2022, Applied’s Chief Technology Officer, Om Nalamasu, was named to the U.S. Commerce Department’s new Industrial Advisory Committee, which advises CHIPS for America on issues related to domestic semiconductor R D.

Under provisions of the CHIPS Act, recipients of manufacturing grants must demonstrate a commitment to increasing the participation of economically disadvantaged individuals in the semiconductor workforce.

Applied is currently working with global trade association SEMI to create an apprentice program where Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturers can train students from underrepresented communities.

This program will extend our work with the Foundation’s Generation Girl initiative, providing a multi rung pathway from early STEM education to college to employment within the industry.

Applied Materials also joined a broad business and stakeholder coalition in 2022 to push the successful passage of the U.S.

Respect for Marriage Act, which codifies into U.S. law protections for same sex and interracial couples.

Our Government Affairs team worked with our trade associations to garner votes for the bill, which ultimately passed both houses of Congress with strong bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden on December 13.

In advance of Senate passage, Applied Materials was one of the first corporate signatories to a Human Rights Campaign open letter calling on Congress to move the legislation, along with more than 170 other companies.

Business and Trade Associations Applied Materials maintains memberships in various business and trade associations that advance issues aligned with our corporate strategy and the needs of our company, industry, employees and communities.

Our membership in a group does not imply that we endorse the entirety of that group’s policy positions.

In 2022, Applied paid approximately 564,000 in trade association membership dues, 21% of which were specified by the associations as non deductible lobbying expenditures.

This total does not include conference or event sponsorships, programming activities or similar costs.

Applied Materials reports on federal lobbying through the Lobbying Disclosure Act Database and files periodic reports with federal and state agencies, as appropriate.

Our U.S. Trade, Business and Civic Associations membership list can be found here.

Political Action Committee (AMPAC) contributes to federal candidates, political action committees and party committees supporting issues of strategic importance to Applied, consistent with all legal requirements.

Our State Contributions Committee oversees corporate political spending to advance those strategic issues at the state and local levels.

While Applied pays the administrative expenses for AMPAC, the committee is funded entirely through voluntary contributions from eligible employees, and does not make any contributions using Applied Materials corporate funds.

AMPAC’s activities are overseen and its contributions reviewed and approved by the AMPAC Board of Directors.

Contributions are based solely on corporate objectives, without regard for the private political preferences of either the employees who contribute to AMPAC or individual committee members.

During 2022, political contributions made by AMPAC totaled 69,500.

See the Corporate Governance Addendum for additional details on Applied’s political donation policies, mechanisms and compliance practices.

Applied Materials respects the privacy of all individuals with whom we communicate and interact, whether directly or via our software or website.

Our privacy policy describes procedures regarding our collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information collected through these channels, and we maintain a dedicated email address for all questions and comments about our data privacy policies and safeguards.

In 2022, we continued to adapt and expand our privacy program to comply with evolving global laws and new laws effective in 2023.

Modernized our Document Retention Policy, streamlining it for better execution, efficiency and consistent implementation.

Continued automating our data privacy program using a platform that centralizes privacy policies, assessments and other documentation, and allows for the mapping of personal data across our systems.

Applied Materials Global Privacy Principles Applied Materials is committed to safeguarding the data of our employees and trusted business partners.

We recognize the importance that our global workforce, customers and suppliers place on their personal information (PI), and we take seriously our obligations to protect that data.

We published our internal Global Privacy Principles in 2022 to help serve as guiding principles for how the company and our workforce should safeguard PI.

We continue to leverage technology to visualize how PI flows throughout our organization, create a unified approach to compliance, and proactively keep pace with increasingly complex and sometimes conflicting privacy and data laws.

Using an industry leading privacy compliance platform, we standardized, semi automated and streamlined our privacy reviews of the new technologies and applications that Applied is onboarding for its own use, reducing compliance risk while minimizing the impact to business operations.

At Applied Materials, making a positive contribution to the world around us is the foundation of our culture.

Through efforts led by Applied and the Applied Materials Foundation, we serve the needs and values of our employees and the communities where we live and work, making them part of who we are and what we stand for as a company.

Applied and the Foundation deploy human and financial resources worldwide to help social impact and nonprofit organizations fulfill their service missions free of discrimination against any group or individual.

Employee engagement amplifies our positive community impact, often via company initiated events that connect our people with local nonprofits for volunteer work or personal charity support.

Our Employee Giving and Volunteer Time Grant programs amplify our people’s impact.

During culturally significant celebrations, such as Black History Month and Pride Month, our employee communications highlight local and national charities working for social justice and equity, suggesting ways to make a positive impact.

Applied and the Foundation focus funding across five primary areas: education, civic engagement, arts and culture, the environment and girls’ empowerment the latter primarily through the Generation Girl initiative, a signature Foundation program.

We also pivot in response to societal need, as we did in 2022 to support organizations helping Ukrainians displaced by the Russia invasion.

In 2022, Applied and the Foundation awarded 11.2M in direct corporate contributions and Foundation grants, benefiting 260 recipients in nine countries.

The total represents a decrease from 2021 due to budget constraints.

We believe our role as a corporate citizen and as individual human beings is to make the world a better place, and we are committed to taking meaningful action.

A Commitment to Equity Centered Engagement At Applied Materials, we believe equity centered community engagement contributes to a more just, fair and humane world.

We are committed to learning from leaders who live the issues we want to help solve, and to working respectfully with voices at the community level.

We are determined to support solutions that address societal imbalances, provide access to resources and opportunity, and build thriving, resilient families and neighborhoods.

Grantmaking: Applied and the Applied Materials Foundation began collecting detailed information about publicly self identified race or ethnicity of potential grantees to ensure that the organizations we’re funding are led and staffed by people who are representative of and trusted by the communities they serve.

To increase transparency, we began posting names and information for all grant recipients on our website in 2022, segmented by Applied Materials grantees and Applied Materials Foundation grantees.

I volunteer with Opening Doors 2020 for an hour a week, serving hot lunch to the Downtown San Jose community experiencing homelessness.

I am grateful that Applied Purpose matches my volunteer time with monetary donations to further the impact on my community.

Two years ago, the Global Community Affairs team at Applied Materials partnered with Black owned consulting firm Frontline Solutions to conduct an equity assessment that examined both our philanthropic work’s programs and practices and the personal beliefs of those efforts’ leadership and staff, seeking to identify unintended barriers arising from biases, norms or systemic structures.

Based on the assessment’s results and Frontline Solutions’ feedback, we made a public declaration of commitment to equity centered community involvement across three core areas.

Employee engagement: Supported by outside vendor Visit.org, our Community Affairs team worked to expand opportunities to engage employees with high impact nonprofits outside our existing network, with a focus on organizations serving and led by people of color.

Personal and professional development: To ensure that Applied and Foundation decision making structures and Community Affairs operations are centered in equity, our teams continued a program of internal learning activities to address biases and norms that negatively impact communities and organizations of color.

We also began funding DEI focused professional development opportunities for nonprofits in the community, including Racial Justice Learning Series workshops conducted by the Silicon Valley Council of Nonprofits and trainings for Austin area organizations on using data to support community and mission driven services for communities of color.

Promoting Civic Engagement, Development and Relief Civic engagement grants from Applied and the Foundation strengthen the ability of Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and the nonprofit sector to address community challenges and help people find stability in difficult times.

We channel funding to organizations that address food insecurity and homelessness, secure affordable housing for people in need, provide job and career training, inspire collaborative solutions for community challenges, and build the capacity of the nonprofit sector.

We also contribute to relief and recovery efforts in response to natural and manmade disasters around the world.

Provide basic needs and resources for homeless, low income and immigrant communities.

Conduct after school and youth leadership development programs for at risk youth.

Engage community members in addressing issues of human rights, inclusion, anti Asian hate and equality.

Promote collaboration to solve community challenges.

Fight Against Hunger Around the globe, food insecurity increased year over year in 2022 due primarily to food price inflation and the disruption of grain exports from Ukraine and the greater Black Sea region.

In the U.S., the expiration of many COVID era nutrition programs and rising food costs combined to boost food insecurity by some 6% over 2021.

In the face of this need, Applied Materials continued its annual Fight Against Hunger fundraising campaign.

In North America, our employees raised 1.89 million.

Adding a dollar for dollar match from the Foundation, we were able to distribute 3.8 million to 53 food banks across the U.S. and Canada.

Globally, our employees in Korea, Greece, and Taiwan made notable contributions to the effort.

In our Greece organization, which joined Applied Materials in 2020 via our acquisition of IP startup Think Silicon, employees ran their first Fight Against Hunger campaign in partnership with nonprofit To Chamogelo tou Pediou (The Smile of the Child), raising 11,427 with the Foundation match to help alleviate hunger in local communities.

In Taiwan, a combination of employee giving and Foundation matching funds raised US 88,000 for separate initiatives of the Children Are Us Foundation, the Garden of Hope Foundation, and Taiwan People’s Food Bank Association that explore the hunger issue from different angles.

The donation will provide vulnerable individuals, families and communities hunger relief, nutrition education and community development assistance throughout the year.

Our Korea based employees supported the Fight Against Hunger campaign by teaming with Child Fund Korea to raise funds to purchase boxes of nutritious food for those who need it most.

All these efforts reflect Applied’s values and purpose, aligning who we are with what matters to our employees and what’s needed in our communities.

Support for Ukraine Refugee Relief Russia’s attack on Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in Europe’s largest internal refugee crisis since World War II, uprooting 13 million people from their homes.

Nearly 8 million refugees are currently scattered across Europe, and more than 5 million are internally displaced within Ukraine.

Applied Materials and our employees responded immediately to this crisis.

In the first four months of the war, our European colleagues donated approximately 112,650 EUR, which the company matched for a total 225,000 EUR donation to Save the Children Deutschland eV.

These funds allowed the nonprofit to provide food and shelter to displaced Ukrainian families, equip children to continue their educations, and operate mobile youth spaces in remote communities to give children a safe and supportive environment to socialize and play.

Ukrainians with food, supplies, and help integrating into host communities.

Colleagues in Israel spearheaded several efforts on behalf of Ukrainian refugees, collecting donations that were matched by the company to provide a 55,000 donation to UNICEF Ukraine, collecting 15 boxes of blankets and winter clothing that were transported to the Poland Ukraine border for distribution, and collecting 1,000 food parcels and boxes of personal hygiene items for Ukrainian refugees arriving in Israel.

Additionally, a group of Ukrainian speaking Applied employees volunteered to provide refugee schoolchildren with weekly Hebrew language assistance and homework tutoring.

Protection Civile Is re to collect food and goods for shipment to Ukraine at the start of the war.

Colleagues in Alzenau and Darmstadt, Germany, collected 300 kilos of food donations that were sent to Ukraine by the charity Hoffnungstr ger Ost e. V.

Applied Materials believes all children of every race, gender and income level deserve equal opportunity to follow their dreams and reach their full potential, but barriers to access too frequently stand in the way.

Starting early in life, girls particularly girls of color and from low income backgrounds face stereotypes, gender bias, and other structural and societal barriers that can prevent them reaching their full potential.

Women remain greatly underrepresented in many fields, including STEM, and the gender disparity is even more pronounced in executive leadership roles.

To do our part to highlight and address these inequalities, the Applied Materials Foundation created Generation Girl, a five year initiative that invests in organizations and programs that support girls in developing self efficacy and confidence, offer access to high quality STEM education, and build the capacity of girl serving nonprofits.

By equipping girls with the knowledge and confidence to enter professions where women are historically underrepresented, we’re helping create a future where women regardless of their background can thrive in their field of choice.

In year four of the Generation Girl initiative, the Foundation provided over 945,000 in grants to 28 programs across the U.S., reaching 8,873 girls a 48% increase from year three (2020 21).

Generation Girl has enabled support for families in Spanish speaking and immigrant communities and families new to youth programming Girl Scouting.

Organizations funded under the Adult Training Professional Development Services area are not included in theis data.

Generation Girl is reaching its target population: We focus our support to grantee organizations that primarily serve middle school and high school girls, engaging girls of color and girls from low income backgrounds.

In 2022, 82% of grantee programs served girls in middle or high school, with the remaining 18% serving girls in elementary and or post secondary school.

The percentage of low income girls served dropped slightly to 62% from 64% in 2020 21.

As organizations increased their in person programs, the percentage of Hispanic Latina, African American Black and Native American Indigenous girls decreased to 60% from 69% in 2020 21.

Generation Girl served adults who are important to girls’ lives and success: Two programs focused on strengthening the sector provided 317 adults with substantive training to increase their capacity to provide high quality, gender equitable programs.

Sixteen grantee organizations focusing on girls’ empowerment and STEM outcomes engaged 3,388 parents, relatives, mentors, after school coordinators, teachers and other adults through resource sharing and providing technological support.

Generation Girl supported girls’ feelings of self efficacy and self confidence: In 2021 22, 86% of girls surveyed reported positive levels of self efficacy and 80% reported positive levels of self confidence.

Both results are commensurate with pre pandemic levels.

Generation Girl helped girls explore STEM and its connection to their goals: Ninety three percent of participants increased their STEM competency (a 20% jump from 2020 21) and 85% increased their STEM interest ( 10% from 2020 21).

Ninety three percent also reported believing that STEM skills are relevant to their daily lives ( 5%, the highest reported level since the initiative began), 79% reported increased awareness of STEM careers, and 83% increased their interest in pursuing a post secondary degree.

Generation Girl continued facilitating connections among grantees: Ninety two percent of grantee organizations reported that networking and collaboration opportunities through Generation Girl improved their practice, and 100% reported that the Generation Girl Community of Practice, in which representatives from our 30 grantee organizations meet to discuss common challenges and pursue partnership opportunities, strengthened their programs.

As a Generation Girl grantee, the National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity Education Foundation has been working with the Manor Independent School District in Central Texas to increase participation and performance on the math pipeline.

When their efforts began in 2018, the percentage of girls taking Algebra 1 in eighth grade was 26%.

This year, 100% of the district’s sixth grade girls are enrolled in advanced math, putting Manor ISD on track for 100% enrollment in eighth grade Algebra 1 in the 2024 25 school year.

The consistent funding over the past several years has allowed us to bring our life changing Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) programs to diverse, underserved schools and communities where girls have less opportunities.

In 2022, more than 200 Applied employees took part in over a dozen in person or virtual volunteer opportunities supporting Generation Girl, including mentoring for career skills and pathways, teaching hands on STEM workshops, and acting as guest judges for coding events.

Promoting Education Access At Applied Materials, we believe education inspires young minds, opens new doors and paves the way to more promising futures.

Putting this philosophy into action globally, the company and the Foundation invest in efforts to help students fulfill their academic potential, regardless of their socioeconomic status, race, gender or where they call home.

In 2022, Applied Materials and the Applied Materials Foundation awarded over 2.1 million in grants to 58 organizations providing direct educational services and teacher professional development.

Sustainability Report 2022 Funding Arts and Culture The COVID 19 pandemic had a devastating impact on the arts worldwide.

In the U.S., the arts economy shrank at nearly twice the rate of the economy as a whole in 2019 20, with performing arts shrinking by nearly 73%.

Though pandemic impacts and restrictions began falling worldwide in 2022, many arts organizations that survived are still struggling.

To support arts programming and performances, museums and exhibitions, arts education and engagement, and culture and heritage focused arts programming, Applied and the Applied Materials Foundation awarded 1M in grants to 59 nonprofits in FY22.

Arts in Action (San Jose, CA), which provides art kits for three schools that serve under resourced communities.

When we say Applied Materials works to Make Possible a Better Future, we don’t just mean through technology innovation.

A better future is also a more fair and industrious future, where people can follow their passions into careers that bring out their full potential and put that potential to work for the greater good.

At Applied, we’re making that vision a reality through our commitment to inclusion and diversity in all our practices for attracting, engaging and retaining top performing talent.

They know we have a strong technical foundation, troubleshooting skills and a community focused mindset.

Recruiting Diverse Talent Our diverse talent recruiting has a global scope, seeking candidates from the technology industry and related fields and attracting talented new graduates from universities with strong engineering and science programs, including U.S. schools with large Black and Hispanic Latino student populations.

Applied’s internship program connected me to people who genuinely care.

Now that I’m a full time employee, I am surrounded by teams that ensure that everyone can learn, grow and contribute to the success of the company.

Over the past several years, Applied Materials has been working to grow a Culture of Inclusion across every business group, function, strategy, process and region of our company, and we’re doing it for one simple reason: helping everyone succeed.

We know that driving cultural transformation around diversity, respect, fairness, and teamwork helps our employees to become their best selves, sets our company up for greater success, and models the equity and inclusion that should be among the hallmarks of a just society.

Now more than ever, Applied is positioned to be a leader in creating a more diverse, inclusive culture and showing our industry a winning employee value proposition for the future.

With analysts predicting that the global semiconductor industry will grow to 1 trillion in revenues by 2030, our employee base will need to grow by roughly 60,000 employees over the same period.

Generation Z will be a big part of that growth, and with 48% of that cohort representing communities of color, the industry must become a place where they can feel at home.

In 2020, our CEO, Gary Dickerson, announced DEI commitments to increase transparency, establish meaningful targets, and implement training to reduce bias and educate employees on how to listen, learn and act.

This year we made progress against all three, including announcing in this report a new set of 2030 diversity goals designed to increase the number of women in our global workforce and underrepresented minorities in the U.S., at both the employee and executive levels.

Our Executive Leadership Team is committed to continually transforming our culture to be more inclusive, operationalizing DEI in all of our processes, and achieving our DEI goals.

To assure we achieve our goals by 2030, in 2022 we launched our DEI Engine, a new framework of tools, training and processes for all employees, aimed at moving our transformation to the next level.

If I look at my own team, every person brings a unique gift, a unique talent that we can use to help solve problems.

And if we are not leveraging everybody on the team, then we’re never going to be as good as we can be.

Applied’s DEI Vision Diversity, equity and inclusion isn’t just a slogan.

DIVERSITY means everyone: the variety of differences and similarities among people, often called diversity dimensions.

EQUITY is the guarantee of fair treatment, access, opportunity and advancement, paired with a process that identifies and eliminates barriers that have held some groups back from full participation.

This principle acknowledges that there are historically underserved and underrepresented populations and that we need fairness to restore balance, equality and opportunity for all groups.

INCLUSION is a dynamic state of feeling, belonging and operating in which diversity is leveraged and valued to create a fair, healthy and high performing organization.

At Applied, DEI means embracing change as a new governing philosophy, not just tweaking the tactics and strategies of the past.

At its most basic level, it’s about breaking the cycle of looks like me hiring and welcoming new employees of all backgrounds and experiences.

Embedding a culture of respect, empathy and collaboration across our strategy and business processes.

Creating safe spaces where all voices can be heard.

Reinventing our culture to value a healthier work life balance.

Identifying and partnering with more diverse suppliers.

Topics ranged from general discussions of gender, race and LGBTQ issues to focuses on disabilities and innovation, personal development, multi generational teams, neurodiversity, mental health, micro aggressions bias and inclusive leadership.

Engaging Leaders as Champions of Change As Applied Materials evolves to make DEI integral to the way we do business, our leaders are increasingly demonstrating their personal commitment to raising awareness and driving change.

At our 2022 Applied Leadership Group (ALG) meeting, over 400 senior leaders learned about inclusion not only as a concept, but as a personal story and a call to action.

Seek out learning to improve their personal inclusive leadership.

Identify actions to improve and embed the Culture of Inclusion in their organizational and talent strategy.

Talk about what inclusion means to them in multiple forums.

Applied Materials is consistently recognized for our efforts around workforce diversity and military veteran recruitment.

During a panel discussion, leaders heard from ERG leadership about how their groups offer opportunities for employees to create a more inclusive culture, advance themselves professionally and volunteer in their communities.

Panel members encouraged leaders to support and advocate for ERGs, and to consider becoming executive sponsors.

Building core capabilities and helping leaders develop an authentic leadership presence around DEI.

Building empathy and an understanding of how DEI issues affect oneself and others.

Becoming more conscious of how personal behaviors can unintentionally reinforce unproductive dynamics.

Making personal commitments for change in their leadership style and their approach to influencing change across the enterprise.

The program is delivered via an initial two day session, plus coaching, independent study and a follow up workshop.

In 2022, more than 100 Applied leaders completed the program.

These efforts build on changes introduced in prior years to help our leaders take Applied Materials in the direction we need to go changes such as introducing an Inclusive Leader Action Guide to provide pragmatic strategies and best practices for our executive staff and people managers, creating diversity dashboards that allow U.S. leaders to track progress against diversity goals for each organization, and tying executive compensation directly to the achievement of our diversity objectives via our Corporate Scorecard.

Our Culture of Inclusion progress is shared on a quarterly basis with our Human Resources and Compensation Committee.

Employee Resource Groups Applied Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are one important way we ingrain inclusive culture, inspire and engage our diverse talent, and positively impact the communities in which we work and live.

Today, our network includes eight ERGs, with 28 chapters around the world.

Young Professionals Network (YPN): To foster an increased sense of belonging for new hires and new college graduates, YPN sponsored YPN Week at all Applied U.S. sites, which offered opportunities to network with fellow newly hired graduates as well as Applied executives and leaders across diverse gender, race, cultural and socio economic backgrounds.

This event helped new hires learn and grow beyond their job roles, find mentors, increase understanding and compassion for diverse groups, and serve our community.

Our ERGs continue to increase in overall membership and create programs and events that support and promote our Culture of Inclusion.

In 2022, ERGs sponsored learning, networking and community service events across the world.

Women’s Professional Development Network (WPDN): Over the course of 2022, three virtual events sponsored by the Taiwan WPDN focused on one theme: empowering women.

Veterans Employee Team: This U.S. based military veterans ERG completed its second annual Veterans Helping Veterans community service project with nonprofit Rebuilding Together Silicon Valley (RTSV) to paint and repair the home of a local Korean War veteran in need.

Applied has a long standing reputation as a top employer for veterans, regularly ranking as one of the best workplaces for veterans.

We currently employ more than 1,000 veterans including approximately 330 newly hired in 2022.

Diversity and inclusion have been a really big focus area at Applied.

And it’s something that I find, in our culture, we really, really value.

I grew up in the U.S. and for me, it’s been really interesting to learn where other people come from and ask about their history, their culture, what they do, what they don’t do, and see if I can apply that.

Our month long Global Field Safety Campaign in August 2022 reached 7,800 Applied employees with trainings that reinforced our injury and incident free culture and key safety programs.

Find additional information on Applied’s Occupational Health and Safety Program here.

Safety Targets and Performance Applied Materials maintains global programs and monitoring to promote a safety culture and safe work practices, minimize workplace risks, and support continuous improvement in our safety performance.

We use the definitions set by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for recordable, lost time and restricted day injuries.

These definitions are implemented globally for data gathering and analysis, and we set both corporate and site level targets and objectives, which are embedded into annual performance objectives.

These key safety metrics are made available to all business units in our safety performance dashboards.

At the end of each year, we analyze results and reset targets for the coming year.

Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR) In FY22, Applied achieved a TCIR of 0.35, beating our goal of 0.40 and significantly outperforming the industry benchmark of 0.60.

Health and Safety Violations In FY22, we received two violations worldwide, one for a non hazardous waste disposal issue at our Gloucester, MA, location (no fines) and one OSHA machine guarding safety violation considered other than serious ( 2,800 fine).

Safety Training Rate For FY22, Applied Materials achieved a 97.5% safety training rate for relevant employees.

Weekly safety training penetration reports, across all business units, are sent to all members of executive management as part of the weekly Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Update Report.

The main types of work related injuries are strains, sprains and fall related incidents.

TCIR is calculated as (total number of OSHA Recordable injuries and illnesses x 200,000) total hours worked by employees.

DART rate is calculated as (total number of DART incidents x 200,000) total hours worked by employees.

LTSR is calculated as (total number lost workdays x 200,000) total hours worked by employees.

Over the past two years, Applied Materials has taken several significant steps toward formalizing our commitment to protecting human rights wherever we do business.

In 2021 we published our first Human Rights Statement of Principles and formed a cross functional Human Rights Working Group to lead our Corporate Human Rights Program.

This assessment underscored that Applied Materials has opportunities to elevate the importance of human rights management.

New training on human rights and RBA requirements to educate Applied workers and support supply chain outreach.

In 2022, we partnered with Article One Advisors to complete a three phase project to proactively identify human rights risks associated with our operations and assess whether we are managing these risks effectively through our existing policies and processes.

Non compliance with Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) working hour limits.

A Responsible Manufacturing Program to operationalize human rights governance across our manufacturing operations to comply with our Human Rights Statement of Principles and the RBA Code of Conduct.

Internal communications to further embed human rights into company culture.

Applied Materials invests in transforming our business to Make Possible a Better Future for our industry.

As the effects of climate change continue to impact our lives and economy with increasing frequency, the demand for corporate action becomes more urgent.

At the same time, the semiconductor industry is powering a digital transformation that can fundamentally reshape our future to be more sustainable, equitable and just.

Big emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), electric vehicles (EVs), and 5G 6G networks are creating unprecedented demand for semiconductors across the industry, while geopolitical pressure is prompting legislative action by the U.S. and EU to ramp up domestic production.

As the leader in materials engineering solutions, we recognize the opportunity this presents and the responsibility it requires, and we are working to demonstrate sustainable transformation by example.

Across our facilities, our value chain and the geographies in which we operate, we are doing our part to accelerate the transition to a low carbon future.

In 2022, Applied experienced record business growth as we aggressively addressed a significant order backlog spurred by pandemic related supply chain disruptions.

Although our Category 11 (use of sold products) carbon emissions doubled during this period of rapid growth, we still saw improvements in per wafer emissions intensity.

This is due, in part, to changes in our product mix year over year, adjustments to our process recipes, and progress toward our 3x30 goals.

We are expanding our use of renewable electricity, including onsite solar installations and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), as we work to reduce our Scope 2 emissions.

Largely through our VPPA with White Mesa Wind, we reached our goal of being fully powered by renewable electricity in the U.S., and we are 69% of the way toward 100% renewable electricity globally.

To help drive global demand for renewable electricity across our industry and expedite the transition to clean energy sources, we work with key customers and engage in industry coalitions and collaborations such as RE100 and the Clean Energy Buyers Alliance (CEBA).

Since about 80% of our emissions are tied to customer use of Applied products, enabling more efficient energy consumption by our customers and the semiconductor industry as a whole is just as essential as transitioning to clean energy.

Through innovations like those associated with our 3x30 goals, we are working to significantly reduce the total equivalent energy and emissions impact associated with our semiconductor products.

In 2022, we set a new goal to reduce per wafer Scope 3 Category 11 emissions by 55% by 2030 and have submitted the goal for SBTi validation.

We are committed to decoupling growth from our carbon emissions footprint so we can meet soaring demand while protecting the planet.

Through cross industry collaborations like the Semiconductor Climate Consortium, we are engaging on policy, sharing learnings, and problem solving collectively to speed progress for our business, our customers, our industry and the world.

Key Highlights Reached 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. and 69% globally defined a roadmap to reach 100% renewables globally by 2030.

Began installation of a 5.6 megawatt solar array across three quarters of the Applied Materials Logistics Service Center roof the largest rooftop solar array in Central Texas.

Set science based Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions reduction targets, with.

Achieved a decrease in water intensity even as absolute water withdrawal increased due to business growth improved our CDP water rating to B.

Completed a Cold Aisle Containment System retrofit on our main data center, achieving Power Use Effectiveness (PUE) reductions estimated to save 306,200 kWh of electricity annually3.

Joined RE100, a global initiative led by The Climate Group and CDP, comprised of businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity.

Continued to invest in, and advance progress toward, identifying solutions across our semiconductor products and OLED technology to lower energy consumption and emissions.

Continued to advance automated carbon footprint data capture associated with process cooling water (PCW) in semiconductor manufacturing.

Became a Founding Member and Governing Council Member of the Semiconductor Climate Consortium, which works across the semiconductor value chain from equipment manufacturers to fab operators to device manufacturers to reduce technology’s GHG impacts.

While growth in our facilities footprint and production output caused Applied’s total energy consumption to rise 7% in 2022, our successful renewable electricity strategy reduced the impacts of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

By achieving 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. and 69% globally, we were able to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions footprint by 3% from our 2019 base year.

In a year of unprecedented demand across the semiconductor industry, we saw our Scope 3 Category 11 emissions (use of sold products) for semiconductor products nearly double from our 2019 baseline.

Given the strong and increasing demand for our products, we anticipate this robust business growth will continue over the coming decade.

To limit the environmental impacts of that growth, we are working toward SBTi validation of our Paris aligned science based targets.

Successful completion of these targets would encourage product and operational efficiencies and a 100% global shift to renewable power in order to achieve a 50% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a 55% reduction per wafer in Scope 3 Category 11 emissions for semiconductor products, both by 2030 (baseline: 2019).

Applied Materials understands that protecting biodiversity is an essential part of maintaining healthy ecosystems, protecting watersheds, and supporting a future in which global temperature rise is limited to 1.5 C above pre industrial levels.

While we do not operate in biodiversity sensitive regions or employ commodities that impact biodiversity, we nevertheless perform thorough environmental assessments when planning construction of any new real estate facilities and prioritize building on land in our existing portfolio.

We are in the process of evaluating opportunities to support biodiversity efforts, particularly nature based carbon removal projects, and will be announcing our participation at the appropriate time.

Scope 1 and 2 Emissions GHG Footprint The largest part of our Scope 1 and 2 footprint is traceable to the power needs of our factories and labs, which represent our primary opportunity for change.

In 2022, we completed work with energy consultant 3Degrees on a renewable energy strategy and roadmap that will expand our renewable energy portfolio to achieve our goal of 100% renewable electricity globally by 2030, with associated drops in Scope 2 emissions.

In 2022, Applied Materials’ Scope 1 and 2 market based emissions totaled 139,486 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), representing a 3% decrease from base year FY19.

Although we made substantial progress on Scope 1 and 2 reductions between FY19 and FY21, a jump in business production in FY22 notably, an increase in process gas use in our R D labs and higher electricity consumption in our Asia operations countered the reductions we gained from reaching 100% renewable electricity in the U.S.

Since 2021, our consumption of electricity and natural gas increased by 8% and 2% respectively, aligning with our 5% operational footprint growth during the same period.

Although our consumption of process gases increased dramatically over 2021 ( 89% year over year), the increase since base year 2019 was only 1%.

Process gas emissions are driven primarily by the requirements of tools being tested in our R D labs.

Applied is working both internally and through industry groups to identify solutions to lower the impact of these gases through efficiency measures, identification of lower impact gases, and better abatement technologies.

Climate Risks Applied Materials monitors current and emerging climate related risks on an annual basis.

Responsibility for evaluating company wide risks is initiated by the ESG team and shared with relevant enterprise risk management (ERM) stakeholders.

Site specific risks are monitored and managed by Applied’s Business Continuity Planning (BCP) team, as well as local facilities teams and EHS teams.

When planning new sites, we consider the relative climate risk of candidate sites.

Our risk identification, mitigation and management plans help ensure our ability to recover quickly from climate related events and effectively support our customers’ and suppliers’ operations.

In line with recommendations from the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Applied contracted a third party to conduct a two year Climate Risk Assessment, identifying key physical risks across our global operations as well as transition risks and opportunities across our value chain.

Phase 1 of the assessment, completed in 2020, gauged physical risk exposure across our global operations by identifying our highest risk assets and operations based on various chronic and acute geographical climate hazard indicators.

The assessment utilized three different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) representing low , moderate , and high risk climate change scenarios for 2019 (baseline), 2030, and 2050.

Phase 2, which concluded in March 2022, provided insights on Applied’s projected risks associated with the transition to a low carbon economy between 2025 and 2050.

Benchmarked against our industry peers, the assessment gauges relative risk levels across four key areas policy and legal, market, reputation and technology in which climate risk mitigation and adaptation strategies may shift asset values and raise business and compliance costs.

To date, we have not identified any material climate related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business.

Applied plans to re run a comprehensive physical and transition climate risk assessment in 2023.

See the TCFD Index in our Report Annex for assessment results.

Renewable Energy In 2022, we achieved our goal of powering Applied’s U.S. operations with 100% renewable electricity and reached 69% in our worldwide renewables rate.

In partnership with energy consultant 3Degrees, we completed a roadmap to help us assess current renewable energy opportunities across key global markets, prioritize near term sourcing, improve consumption forecasts, and scale procurement to meet demand bringing us closer to our goal of 100% green power by 2030, worldwide.

On site solar power generation: Applied Materials maintains on site solar generating capacity at our facilities in Sunnyvale, CA Austin, TX Singapore Bangalore, India and Xi’an, China.

Combined, these arrays generated 157 MWh of clean power in 2022.

Three additional solar projects are in progress: a new 5.4 MW system at our Logistics Service Center (LSC) in Austin, TX a 4 MW onsite offsite solar project in Rehovot, Israel and a 700 kW onsite solar plant in Taiwan.

The LSC array is expected to be Applied’s largest on site system and the largest rooftop installation in Austin.

Virtual Power Purchase Agreements: Financial contracts with external solar, wind and other renewable energy generating projects reduce our Scope 2 emissions inventory by delivering clean power to the grid.

We have a VPPA with the White Mesa Wind project, which began operations in October 2021 and was fully operational throughout 2022.

Utility green procurement programs: We purchase renewable energy directly from utility providers in Santa Clara and San Jose, CA Austin, TX and Alzenau, Germany.

Renewable Energy Credits: Our White Mesa VPPA currently represents 58% of our total global renewable energy and 59% of our total U.S. renewable energy portfolio.

We also participate in green utility programs (32% of global portfolio) and purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs) (10%).

Through these strategies, Applied enabled 319,180 MWh of green power in 2022, covering all our U.S. and 69% of our worldwide electricity footprint a year over year improvement of more than 37% in the U.S. and 32% globally.

Working at Applied enables me to broaden my global perspective and foster my boundless creativity in my jobs.

My fervor lies in engaging employees in corporate social responsibility, evident by the gleaming dedication in their eyes while participating in volunteerism.

I strongly believe that each sustainability measure we implement for the betterment of our employees and society will have a positive impact not only on our company but also on our community.

Once better data becomes available, we plan to add product use emissions data from our Display and Adjacent Markets segment to our annual emissions reporting.

In 2022, Display represented 5% of our total sales.

In 2022, we improved the granularity of product groups modeled for Category 11 and applied more specific grid emission factors based on the countries to which the tools are shipped.

We also made improvements to our Scope 3 calculations for Categories 6 (Business Travel), 7 (Employee Commuting), and 15 (Investments).

For a complete overview of these updates, see our Scope 3 methodology.

Applied continues to review the methodology annually to refine its calculations, emissions factors, data, estimates and underlying assumptions, aiming to replace our use of Environmentally Extended Input Output (EEIO) model estimates with primary data wherever possible.

We will report any resulting changes and implications.

See our Report Annex for complete 2021 and 2022 Scope 3 emissions reporting.

Scope 3 Emissions In early 2022, we completed a 2019 Scope 3 emissions inventory for our semiconductor products, giving us a baseline from which to report our Scope 3 inventory for both FY21 and FY22.

Our Scope 3 emissions grew substantially in 2021 and then nearly doubled in 2022 (from our baseline year) due to record breaking production following an order backlog from the COVID 19 pandemic and increasing demand to support emerging technologies.

Despite this rise, we saw improvements in emission intensity driven by fluctuations in our product mix, changes to process recipes, and progress toward our 3x30 objectives.

Among the 15 categories defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Category 11, Use of Sold Products, continues to represent by far our largest share of Scope 3 emissions (78% in FY22).

This category denotes the total emissions from all Applied semiconductor products sold during a reporting year, estimated over the average lifetime of those products (10 years, as described below) and includes emissions from both the technology’s energy draw in customer fabs and the chemicals and gases used in chip making processes.

Category 1, Purchased Goods and Services, is the second largest contributor to our Scope 3 footprint (16%), representing Applied’s estimated upstream supply chain emissions.

This category includes all upstream (i.e., cradle to gate) emissions from the production of products purchased or acquired by us in the reporting year.

While we are in the process of developing semiconductor guidelines for Category 11 emissions through the Semiconductor Climate Consortium, we have developed our own methodology building on the SEMI S23 standard (related to energy, utilities and material use efficiency) to test and model our tools’ energy and process gas consumption in order to estimate product use emissions.

For the purposes of our assessment, we include emissions not only from sold products but also from certain non Applied ancillary and subfab equipment required for the tools’ operation, such as pumps, cooling systems and point of use abatement systems.

Our calculation assumes an average 10 year product lifespan across all Applied tools and technologies.

FY 2020 not included due to abnormal business operations related to COVID 19 pandemic.

Applied implemented a third party business travel emissions platform in 2022 that will go live in 2023, helping our company and employees identify opportunities to decrease emissions and drive further carbon savings.

Calculating emissions data across air, hotel, train and car (rental taxi) transportation, the platform will include a baseline CO2 dashboard with data from January 2019 through December 2021.

By providing traveling employees with real time, point of sale information on their CO2 impacts, the platform can inform decisions to shift spending to better suppliers and more climate friendly transportation options, supporting employee engagement with our Scope 3 emissions reduction goals.

Our emissions reduction efforts are only one part of Applied Materials’ overall commitment to reducing our environmental impacts.

Throughout our global operations, we also work continuously to promote safe and healthy work environments for our people and to conserve resources, reduce waste and demonstrate environmental leadership in our communities.

Our labs and manufacturing facilities account for the largest share of our global energy and water consumption.

Throughout 2022, we continued to pursue corporate level initiatives and site specific conservation, efficiency and recycling reuse programs to improve energy, waste and water management across our global footprint.

EHS Policies, Systems and Governance Applied Materials’ EHS policy commits our company to conducting business operations in a manner that preserves the environment and protects the health and safety of workers, customers and neighboring communities.

The policy is signed by our President and CEO, distributed to all Applied locations globally, and referenced often during site team and management meetings.

Our EHS organization is an integrated entity with teams responsible for EHS in on site operations (including construction, fire and life safety, and contractor safety), hazard and risk identification, customer site support operations, emergency preparedness, environmental management and product safety.

We implement our EHS policy through our Environmental Health and Safety Management System (EHSMS), which conforms with international management system standards such as ISO 14001, ISO 45001, OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), and EHS documentation to the requirements of ISO 9000.

Planning: Legal compliance, risk assessment and controls, objectives and targets, and EHS programs.

Implementation and operation: Program structure and responsibility, training, awareness and competency, communication, documentation, operational control, and emergency preparation and response.

Checking and evaluation: Compliance and performance monitoring, investigations to identify root causes and corrective actions, and performance of EHSMS audits.

Management review: Addressing gaps, setting objectives, and implementing EHSMS improvements.

A list of ISO certifications for our manufacturing sites is available on our website.

Continuously monitoring energy use and conducting energy audits.

Building optimal energy efficiency into all new facility construction, such as through U.S. Green Building Council LEED certification.

Optimizing the temperature of chilled water used in our operations.

Transitioning to 100% renewable electricity worldwide by 2030.

Applied’s total energy use grew by 7% in 2022, tracking growth in both demand for our products and in our real estate footprint ( 5%).

Our energy intensity fell, however, as measured against both revenue and employee headcount.

In 2022, energy and waste reduction efforts produced significant results at Applied Materials sites around the world.

At our Taiwan manufacturing facility, optimization of HVAC fan filter units and makeup air units for cleanroom operation produced energy savings of 498,234 kWh year.

In Santa Clara, CA, installation of a dedicated three ton split AC unit for a commonly used room produced a 481,180 kWh year savings versus running the entire building’s 25 ton AC system.

In another Santa Clara building, reprogramming of rooftop AC units to stage down during non occupancy hours and adding split HVAC units for some rooms resulted in a 558,450 kWh year savings.

In Rehovot, Israel, office areas underwent a major internal renovation implemented in conformance with the Israeli Green Building Standard renovation projects (ISGBC 5281), using locally sourced, low impact materials and energy efficient lighting.

All Applied Silicon Valley sites in California installed Chargepoint EV charging stations, accounting for a reduction of 378,515 pounds of CO2 per year.

See the Climate and Energy section of this report for more on our emissions and renewable power commitments.

It is necessary to create awareness among employees on how ESG is impacting the business as well as the planet they live in.

It is the responsibility of each of us to save the resource for future generations.

This is in alignment with our vision statement Make Possible a Better Future.

Applied is in the midst of a multi year effort to reduce our data center footprint through optimization and a shift to cloud computing.

Austin Cold Aisle Containment: Our Primary Data Center completed a 2022 retrofit to a Cold Aisle Containment system to optimize air flow efficiency and reduce the amount of energy required to cool IT infrastructure, resulting in annual electrical savings of 306,200 kWh.

Santa Clara Data Center: In Q1 2023, we completed migration of our disaster recovery solution and other services to the cloud and moved all remaining services from an inefficient data center to a modern data center co location facility that utilizes Bloom Energy fuel cells as its primary source for powering IT loads.

These projects resulted in a net energy reduction of 20kW.

Amsterdam Colocation Data Center: We migrated a Teamcenter instance to the cloud, reducing power from 110kW to 80kW.

Retirement of Teamcenter equipment is expected to be complete in Q2 2023, resulting in a further 40kW savings.

Waste Management Applied is committed to minimizing waste across our locations and logistics operations, with a special focus on non recyclable, landfill bound waste.

Waste reduction, reuse and recycling programs are managed at the site level and have been successful in minimizing generation of paper waste, increasing reuse and recycling of product and packaging materials, implementing sorting of recyclables at point of disposal, and maximizing composting of organic materials from our cafeteria operations.

Waste management targets are set for individual manufacturing sites based on the ISO 14001 framework and are reviewed on an ongoing basis and scored annually.

In 2022, Applied increased our volume of recycled waste by 11% over 2021 and 56% over 2019.

We also increased our diversion rate from landfill incineration to 72%, up 5% since 2021 however, multi year growth in our manufacturing activities and better data reporting have kept our current rate lower than in 2019.

Generation of hazardous waste rose by 5% from 2021 to 2022, mirroring our 5% growth in real estate footprint.

Our compost program continues to grow, but remains a very small percentage of our overall waste.

See the Design for Sustainability section for information on our responsible product and packaging initiatives.

Hazardous waste management: Hazardous waste accounted for 3% of our annual waste output in 2022.

We contract with licensed third parties to transport waste (including hazardous waste) for off site disposal, consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

Our EHS organization provides oversight of third party hazardous material disposal companies and verifies that all disposal sites and methods meet regulatory requirements.

We also evaluate potential vendors via the CHWMEG Facility Review Program, which provides environmental, operational and financial information on waste treatment, disposal, recycling and storage facilities.

Wastewater management: Applied strives to reduce the negative impacts of wastewater produced by our operations, monitoring to ensure sufficient removal of solids and adherence to permitted parameters (e.g., pH and fluoride content) before discharge to publicly owned treatment works.

Each Applied site is responsible for wastewater monitoring, with problems escalated to the site management team and applicable corporate staff for immediate correction.

During 2022 renovations at our Santa Clara headquarters campus, our facilities team partnered with Green Standards to salvage decommissioned furniture, equipment and other materials and repurpose them through charitable donation, resale and recycling keeping them out of a landfill while generating positive local impact.

At the launch of this project in April, we set out to divert 100% of decommissioned materials.

By the project’s conclusion, we’d reached that goal by diverting 102 tons of materials, 84% through recycling and 16% (worth 23,615) through donations to 17 community organizations, including seven schools.

Cumulatively, these efforts resulted in a savings of 294 metric tons of CO2 emissions.

Sustainability Report 2022 Water Management In 2022, business growth caused our absolute water withdrawal to increase slightly (5% over 2021), but our water intensity per employee has declined to a current value of 0.09 (from 0.14 in 2019) and our CDP Water score improved from C to B.

Overall, Applied’s operations are not high volume water consumers relative to our industry, but we nevertheless strive to optimize water use across our facilities.

Ninety five percent of our water use is in lab or mixed use buildings, with our R D labs accounting for our highest consumption of ultrapure water, followed by our manufacturing operations, routine use at our offices, and landscape irrigation.

We are currently in the process of enhancing our water policy, establishing reduction targets, and creating water efficiency strategies for new labs.

Designing water efficient products, following best practices for tool design and specifications for water use outlined in SEMI industry requirements.

Water recycling and reuse for non potable applications, especially cooling and landscape irrigation.

Rainwater collection at certain sites for use in landscaping or non production needs.

Drought tolerant landscaping and smart irrigation to reduce the number of watering days.

Facilities groups are responsible for water use management at specific Applied sites, with oversight from the company’s EHS organization.

Our Vice President of Global EHS is responsible for ensuring that water related risks and minimization opportunities are assessed as appropriate.

Water reduction is covered under our EHS policy and ISO 14001 EHSMS, which call for our business operations to identify opportunities, make continual improvements on environmental preservation and natural resource conservation, and meet or exceed all relevant regulatory requirements.

Manufacturing and product water use: Only a few select types of Applied tools require ultrapure water in production processes.

Most of our tools require cooling water, which runs in a closed loop process and is negligible in terms of water consumption.

Because of this, our focus on water has come through the lens of energy efficiency for example, looking at hardware and software processes that reduce water flow for our equipment and thus the energy required to pump that water.

As an example, clamp on ultrasonic water flow meters can provide data on the velocity of liquid flowing through a pipe, which can then be used to calculate water volume.

As part of our Design for Sustainability program, we communicate these types of optimization strategies to our largest customers, which collectively represent over 70% of our Scope 3 Category 11 emissions, driving energy and water reductions.

As part of our 3x30 product efficiency modeling initiative, Applied is starting to gather water consumption indicators across all our tools in order to identify efficiency opportunities for specific tools and enable engagement with customers on future water use reduction strategies.

Engagement success is measured through the total number of projects where efficiency measures are implemented across our tools, and the total reductions associated with such projects.

Water risk evaluations: Using the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct tool, Applied Materials conducts an annual analysis to better understand current and future water risks, identify facilities located in regions with medium high, high and extremely high water risk across our global operations, and track their ongoing water use.

In 2020 21, an additional gauge of water stress risk was included in an assessment of physical climate risks conducted for Applied by Trucost, which identified top facilities that, due to their location, are expected to be subject to higher associated risks between 2020 and 2050.

Facilities identified for medium high, high and extremely high water risk are in Xi’an, China (representing 67% of our total water stress withdrawal) Rehovot, Israel (21%) and Arizona, U.S. (9%).

Applied Materials sites around the world are continually working to optimize their water use.

Our lab in Taiwan installed a new process wastewater recycling system, saving 2,624,166 gallons in FY22.

Our lab in Xi’an, China, upgraded four local scrubbers, conserving 2,373,800 gallons of water annually.

Our facility in Austin, TX, began using HVAC condensate for landscape irrigation, conserving 1,364,580 gallons of water annually.

Applied Materials is committed to empowering transformative, high performance innovation that consumes less energy, while also optimizing the life of our existing materials and tools.

We continue to drive progress toward our 3x30 goals, reducing energy and chemical consumption while simultaneously reducing our tools’ physical footprint to enable cleanroom efficiencies.

These goals contribute to our broader ambition to drive rapid and dramatic improvements in chip performance, power, area, cost and time to market (PPACt) across our industry.

Traditional Moore’s Law scale is slowing, and the semiconductor industry must find new ways to increase chip performance while also consuming less power.

Increasingly smaller process nodes means there is less physical space available on a chip for processors.

At the same time, the market is demanding significantly faster time to market for new chip designs.

Solving this materials engineering challenge is urgent, and doing so will benefit the entire technology ecosystem.

Applied is the PPACt Enablement Company , accelerating a new PPACt playbook for our customers and partners and providing the broadest and deepest portfolio of products for delivering materials engineering innovations to market.

Innovations like our Integrated Materials Solutions, which combine multiple processes with customized metrology and sensors in a single system, help our customers create faster, more efficient chips.

Centura Sculpta pattern shaping system, released in early 2023, helps chipmakers reduce process complexity while continuing to shrink designs saving energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and cutting water use.

Applied is also advancing OLED display technology with a device architecture that enables a maskless solution and high material utilization, which reduces energy use and carbon emissions associated with both manufacturing and lifecycle use of the final display product.

As we innovate for the next generation of transformative technology, we’re also working to keep existing materials and tools in use longer, helping to advance a more circular economy.

Recognizing that our supply chain plays an essential role in delivering on our ESG strategy, we created a strategic 10 year roadmap, Supply Chain Certification for Environmental and Social Sustainability (SuCCESS2030), to grow our suppliers’ ESG capabilities and performance.

Three years into the effort, we continue to drive steady progress on aligning suppliers with our business standards, encouraging and supporting robust diversity and inclusion strategies within suppliers’ operations, and increasing our own percentage of spend with women and minority owned suppliers.

Joined imec’s Sustainable Semiconductor Technologies and Systems.

Average per wafer energy use decreased ahead of schedule, in part due to changes in the mix of products sold.

While we expect the reduction rate to slow, we are on track to meet or exceed our 3x30 target.

Design for Sustainability (DfSu) team and its engineering partners in the product business units are pursuing multiple development projects that will significantly reduce chemical impact.

Some of these initiatives are expected to be multi year efforts, but we are on track to meet or exceed the 3x30 target.

Footprint reduction to date is largely the result of productivity improvements in existing tool architectures.

As new product architectures begin volume shipments to customers, footprints will be further reduced and are expected to meet or exceed the 3x30 target.

Enabling the PPACt playbook is an extension of our ongoing 3x30 focus, which defines Applied’s goals for reducing our semiconductor products’ energy consumption, chemical consumption and footprint intensity, all by 2030.

Engineers in our Semiconductor Products Group (SPG) include sustainability as a core criterion on new product performance scorecards, assuring that we employ Design for Sustainability (DfSu) methods and principles from the earliest stages of design innovating systems that consume fewer resources, last longer and support circularity through end of life reuse or recycling.

We also work continuously to improve the sustainability performance of our existing products, both through built in innovation at the manufacturing stage and through upgrading existing systems and developing new tools, service products and efficiency strategies.

Applied is globally certified to ISO 9001:2015 for quality management.

My team succeeds when we combine all of our different perspectives into one optimal product.

Sustainability Report 2022 Design for Sustainability Center of Excellence Within Applied’s Systems Engineering organization, our DfSu Center of Excellence (DfSu) analyzes both in design and existing semiconductor product sets to identify new reduction opportunities for energy, water, waste and chemicals.

Through this design support, the DfSu expands our product groups’ responsibilities to include both performance improvements and power reductions.

By adding to our existing portfolio of energy saving product enhancements, we’re able to share energy optimization opportunities with our customers and model sustainability leadership industry wide.

In Bengaluru, India, the DfSu concept and prototyping lab supports our U.S. product design teams in developing a library of sustainability improvement solutions for our products, advancing 3x30 metrics to normalize comparisons between tools and business units, and promoting standardized methodologies to drive energy and chemical use reductions.

A major highlight of our 2022 product sustainability efforts was the development of EcoTwin, an integrated sustainability software platform designed specifically to reduce the environmental impact of wafer manufacturing tools and related subfab support equipment.

EcoTwin enables first principles understanding of all wafer fab and subfab systems, combining sensor data from our tools with extrinsic IoT electrical sensors to provide a holistic demonstration of energy consumption and support optimization efforts.

Sensors monitoring process cooling water, compressed dry air and house nitrogen can be seamlessly integrated to the platform, which also allows engineers to track and compare carbon impacts of different wafer recipes with component and chemical granularity.

EcoTwin is currently deployed and being evaluated in etch tools at Applied labs and a customer site.

We anticipate releasing it in three stages: EcoTwin Monitor visualization dashboard, EcoTwin Explore for quantifying scenarios, and EcoTwin Improve for autonomous adjustments.

Our ICAPS (IoT, Communications, Automotive, Power and Sensors) team developed and released a new mask patterning tool that reduces power consumption by 83% over the previous generation product.

ICAPS also designed an upgrade for existing tools that has the potential to reduce installed base tools’ power consumption by more than 30 million kWh year.

Our proprietary modeling tools analyze product designs and incorporate end user data to pinpoint sustainability improvement opportunities for legacy, in production and design stage semiconductor manufacturing tools.

These modeling efforts support our 3x30 goals of reducing energy use, chemical consumption and the equipment’s physical footprint to increase throughput density per square foot of cleanroom space.

By modeling tools early in the design process, our product design engineers gain the data they need to reduce a tool’s projected resource consumption and other environmental impacts before the tool goes into production.

Analysis of existing tools supports identification of process efficiency improvements that we can communicate to our customers to boost sustainability performance in their fabs.

Working from a 2019 baseline of energy consumption for our complete line of SPG semiconductor products, we are able to gauge the impact of potential energy reduction strategies and inform calculation of our Scope 3 emissions in Category 11 (use of sold products).

The results of chemical impact analyses also allow us to improve process design and reduce, eliminate and or replace the most negatively impactful chemicals used by our tools.

Baselining our chemical impacts in GHG equivalents also contributes to our Scope 3 Category 11 assessments.

In 2022, Applied joined international research and development organization imec’s Sustainable Semiconductor Technologies and Systems (SSTS) program to expand industry wide models of environmental impact from semiconductor manufacturing and to develop solutions for a more sustainable industry.

Applied is contributing to the effort by providing data to inform the creation of industry level models for energy consumption in wafer production.

Applied’s culture is centered around growing our curiosities and moving forward together.

I am constantly growing my practical and theoretical understanding of emerging technologies.

The third commitment in our 3x30 strategy enabling a 30% reduction in tool footprint per production unit ratio for our semiconductor products by 2030 is an important but sometimes underappreciated leverage point for improving fab sustainability.

By enabling systems with a smaller cleanroom footprint, we enable our customers to make more efficient use of shared, energy consuming resources such as air conditioning, piping and materials.

Additional gains can be made by increasing the throughput of systems in a given footprint.

As semiconductor manufacturers ramp up capacity, these improvements will make each new wave of expansion more eco efficient.

Sustainability Report 2022 Reducing Emissions Through Customer Partnerships Through our focus on improving the sustainability performance of new and existing tools, Applied Materials is helping semiconductor manufacturers realize energy savings, meet their own sustainability goals and shrink the industry’s overall energy and chemical footprint.

Asia and North America, helping reduce GHG emissions and energy consumption of their wafer fab and subfab equipment.

Along with our customer partnerships, we are also engaged with a number of suppliers to improve energy efficiency, reduce GHG emissions and optimize utility consumption of peripheral components.

We expect to implement some of these capabilities in the field in 2023.

Semiconductor Climate Consortium (SCC), a group formed in 2022 by the trade association SEMI with companies across the semiconductor value chain, aimed at accelerating the industry’s GHG reduction efforts.

As part of SEMI, Applied is chairing a task force to explore the development of Environmental Performance Ratings for semiconductor manufacturing equipment components.

The task force aims to define a transparent system that will encourage and simplify the comparison of environmental performance during equipment selection.

Applied Materials works to promote the circular economy vision by eliminating waste through design, creating efficiencies throughout the product lifecycle, and employing materials that can be reused or recycled at the end of a product’s functional life.

Remanufacturing Semiconductor Systems and Parts Our systems are designed to last, to support upgrades and repurposing for new applications, and to be easily repairable if parts fail or performance falls below acceptable standards.

All newly manufactured parts are engineered for greater repairability, and we use refurbished parts whenever possible for repair and remanufacture, contributing to sustainability and cost effectiveness.

In a cross functional effort, new parts are identified for potential repairability during new product introductions.

Within Applied Global Services (AGS), which provides equipment installation, warranty and maintenance support for our products, our service engineering group confirms which parts can be repaired.

We also continually look at parts that come into contact with process chemicals for potential repair or cleaning reuse solutions.

AGS specializes in recovering parts and assemblies from our tools in the field and reconditioning them for reuse, thereby reducing our manufacturing operation’s need for virgin materials.

Each recovered part goes through an exacting process of inspection, decontamination, refurbishment, and repair, and is then recertified by AGS as like new for reuse and recirculation, with a full warranty and the same service level as a new part.

On average, 40% of the parts used for servicing Applied Materials tools (under a service agreement) have been repaired after previous use in an Applied system.

We are constantly improving our processes to grow that number by encompassing more part categories.

We maintain one of the industry’s largest global inventories of spare parts, with recovered parts searchable in our inventory management system and ready to be selected for cleaning and repair.

In 2022, Applied Materials established a European Repair Center in Treviso, Italy, to provide local repair and Total Kit Management (TKM) capabilities to support our European customer base.

Assessing the Carbon Footprint of a Refurbished Part In 2022, AGS conducted a cradle to grave carbon footprint analysis to assess and quantify the impacts and trade offs of refurbishment and reuse versus a business as usual lifecycle.

For this initial screening, only one device a 0041 75950 electrostatic chuck was assessed based on a set of assumptions that included source of raw materials (China), source of components (Taiwan), assembly at Applied Materials locations, distribution by truck (domestic) and plane (international), and end of life treatment (100% of parts sent to landfill).

Refurbishing the part leads to a significantly lower carbon footprint (34% for one cycle and 50% for three cycles) compared with traditional end of life for a single use part.

Impacts from material production drive the difference in carbon footprint, due to the reduced number of original parts needed to return a refurbished part to service.

Transportation distribution accounts for 99% of the carbon impacts of a refurbished part.

The results show that refurbishing parts provides an environmental advantage in reduced carbon footprint when compared with current end of life disposal of single use parts.

To further optimize the refurbishing process, we may consider opportunities to use marine versus air freight for international transportation and avoid overseas transport entirely through investment in local refurbishing locations.

Electricity consumption for assembly, packing, sorting and cleaning in manufacturing facility.

Use impact not included in scope refurbishing at local facilities.

Transportation from customers to collectors and to landfill.

Raw materials production (plastic, metals, ceramics, electronics).

Everybody here is part of a team and nobody’s out there working by themselves.

Someone will help you and guide you if you need it.

Enabling Recycling of Flexible Packaging At Applied’s Flexible Technology Group business unit in Germany, our sales, business development and design functions work with customers to create new solutions for increasing the recyclability of food packaging materials.

Spurred by impending regulatory targets for reducing packaging waste, companies are committing to a full transition to biodegradable, recyclable or renewable materials within the decade, and leveraging Applied’s expertise with roll to roll vacuum coating systems to help them get there.

The focus of this work is using our tools to create single polymer products (e.g., all polypropylene pouches) as an alternative to multilayered aluminum and polymer films, making flexible food packaging easier to sort and recycle.

Launching a project with Mitsui Chemical to create a paper barrier coating able to protect food from contamination, spoilage and leakage.

Continuing to work with a multinational food packaging and processing company to reduce the material mix in aseptic cartons to make them more recyclable, leading toward customer trials in 2023.

Showing the capability of our equipment to run and achieve exceptional barrier on some new, more recyclable substrates, including MDOPE and BOPE (which enable all polyethylene flexible packaging structures) and PEF, a high performance plant based polymer that is both recyclable and degradable.

Working with partners to launch an open source all polypropylene recyclable retort solution that eliminates aluminum foil from the structure, potentially allowing more converters to compete in this fast growing food packaging application.

Proving the superior robustness of HAD AlOx to reactive AlOx through converting processes.

A further step will show how eliminating a secondary topcoating process can reduce energy and cost and improve the recyclability of oxide coated flexible packaging.

Collaborating with other members of the Circular Economy for Flexible Packaging.

In 2022, our studies showing that oxide and aluminum depositions on plastic films do not significantly affect their mechanical recyclability led to new guidelines that accept vacuum deposition products in flexible packaging recycling streams.

Building a Circular Economy for Flexible Packaging Applied Materials is a member of Circular Economy for Flexible Packaging (CEFLEX), a collaborative initiative representing the full value chain of the flexible packaging industry.

CEFLEX stakeholders have endorsed a five step roadmap to building a circular economy for flexible packaging and collaborated on detailed guidelines that give clarity on redesigning to mono material packaging and eliminating waste through innovation.

With major consumer products companies and plastics producers signing on to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Global Commitment to develop a circular economy for plastics, CEFLEX and its stakeholders are innovating new solutions to allow the redesign of consumer household flexible packaging to mono materials without loss in functionality.

Applied Materials develops and implements comprehensive product design, manufacturing, labeling and testing policies and programs to ensure our products are safe to use and comply with applicable legal requirements and industry standards and guidelines.

Third party assessments validate that our products meet applicable safety requirements.

We follow relevant country and region specific requirements.

For example, products distributed in China are marked with a mandatory China RoHS label to comply with the administrative measure on the control of pollution from electronic information products.

Products sold in the European Union comply with regional manufacturing and labeling requirements, including the CE mark affirming conformity with European essential health and safety requirements.

Products sold in the UK bear the similar UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) mark.

Applied Materials products are designed and engineered to minimize safety risks to the end user’s personnel and protect the end user’s facilities and the environment.

Any residual risks must be below a minimum acceptable level when the products are operated, maintained and serviced in accordance with instructions and other information provided to the user.

Our Product Safety group partners with other company functions to oversee the design of products and services, monitors their safety during the product’s lifecycle, and drives compliance with our product safety policy and procedures.

Our risk assessment process follows the applicable SEMI S10 Safety Guideline for Risk Assessment and Risk Evaluation Process on identifying, estimating and evaluating the lifecycle risks of semiconductor equipment beginning with the product design and manufacturing process and continuing through its use.

In 2022, Applied enhanced our Product Safety program by adding Design for Safety (DfSafety) requirements to our Product Development Process (PDP) for all product lines.

These enhancements include performing safety FMECAs (Failure Mode, Effects Criticality Analysis) and reliability FMECAs and enhancing our design process around hardware and software interlocks.

We also incorporated a new, companywide Community of Practice (CoP) forum for all design organizations in Applied to discuss and give additional visibility to product safety issues.

While ongoing global supply chain issues and lingering COVID 19 limitations affected our supply chain operations in 2022, they did not prevent us from achieving progress on our goals.

Supplier diversity and inclusion: Mirroring and assessment: Applied strives to be a partner to our suppliers, providing resources, guidelines, tools and trainings to build capacity on advancing sustainable practices.

We also support our suppliers and sub tier suppliers in their efforts to conform to the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) code of conduct.

From this baseline, we can better gauge progress using RBA assessments and audits.

Our near term supplier diversity targets include increased representation of women and other underrepresented groups and increased percentage spend with women and minority owned businesses, all by 2024.

We are also working with our trade associations to significantly grow the pipeline of diverse talent available to the industry by 2030.

We continued to advance our Supply Chain Certification for Environmental and Social Sustainability (SuCCESS 2030) program, Applied’s 10 year roadmap for strengthening our ESG supply chain strategy for our semiconductor and display businesses.

This effort builds on our foundation of supporting ethical labor practices, environmentally responsible operations, responsible minerals sourcing, and international human rights standards.

Under SuCCESS2030, our assessments of supplier performance and capabilities require shared commitments across core ESG focus areas, most of which include defined performance targets.

SuCCESS2030 is managed through our SuCCESS2030 Office, which oversees metrics and compliance audits and conducts training and coordination with participating suppliers.

Across our operations, we conduct pilot programs to test new efficiency and waste reduction processes, with the intention of sharing key learnings with our supplier partners and magnifying positive impacts across the industry.

Efforts to explore intermodal shipping alternatives to air freight as part of SuCCESS2030 were suspended in 2022 after proving to represent an immaterially small fraction of our overall emissions.

Packaging: Our precision tools and products require carefully designed packaging to avoid damage during transport, and we are continuously exploring strategies to reduce packaging waste, including redesigning cases and crates for reuse, using recyclable material such as corrugated fiberboard for boxes, and doing testing and measurement to gauge the feasibility of reducing virgin materials usage.

Wastewater: Though our own operations are neither water intensive nor major emitters of wastewater, we recognize the need to reduce our industry’s large footprint in both areas.

We have piloted a process of pre treating metal surfaces for rust protection using zinc oxide rather than phosphates (which can damage aquatic systems when released in wastewater), and are looking to scale rollout to all suppliers that possess the requisite capabilities.

Supplier Engagement, Training and Assessment SuCCESS2030 encompasses a series of best practices for building a more sustainable business, society and planet.

As we raise the bar, we are also building our suppliers’ competencies to reach it.

Contract Obligations Applied’s Supplier ESG Requirements document is incorporated into our Global Supplier Agreements and other agreements with direct suppliers.

These requirements are also included in the terms and conditions for logistics suppliers and all purchase order transactions, and are enumerated in our most commonly used agreements for indirect services.

Implement Applied’s Standards of Business Conduct and the.

Comply with our Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy and meet related statutory and regulatory requirements.

Meet Applied’s other ESG requirements in their own operations and ensure compliance among their sub tier suppliers.

Comply with Applied’s Environmental Health and Safety.

Comply with Applied’s minimum product EHS requirements.

Provide requested information to enable Applied’s compliance with material content restriction regulations, including but not limited to REACH (EC number 1907 2006) and the U.S.

Comply with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, addressing the risk of slavery and human trafficking in supply chains.

Supplier Monitoring and Engagement Applied Materials employs a metrics based approach to assessing supply chain ESG risks and reflects these assessments in our supplier scorecards.

Complete annual self assessment questionnaires to measure their conformance to the RBA Code of Conduct (top 80% of direct suppliers by spend and 10% of high risk indirect suppliers, plus some small suppliers in higher risk countries).

Complete an RBA Environmental Survey to provide basic data on GHG emissions, energy use, water withdrawal and waste generation, plus qualitative data on reduction targets and efforts (top 80% of direct suppliers by spend).

To best assess our suppliers’ compliance with local laws related to labor and human rights, EHS, management systems and ethics, we conduct third party audits to the RBA audit protocol, which includes principles from the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the ILO Core Labor Standards, and other international guidelines.

While many companies opted for remote audits in 2022 to accommodate pandemic protocols, we felt the need to conduct worker interviews in person to uphold audit integrity.

To increase scheduling flexibility of these interviews and accommodate COVID shutdowns, we managed the scheduling with the audit firms ourselves.

All other aspects of our Customer Managed Audit process continued to follow the RBA VAP guidelines, including having a fourth party quality check.

Click here for more information on the RBA audit guidelines.

Submit conflict minerals reporting templates, as well as an extended minerals reporting template (EMRT) if applicable, as part of our responsible minerals sourcing due diligence.

Report on their performance under environmental regulations.

Sustainability Report 2022 Capacity Building We want working with Applied to be a partnership, with collaboration driving benefits to all parties.

In 2022, we began offering a structured program of webinars, trainings and assistance to help our suppliers close any gaps across our ESG focus areas.

Weekly live webinars discussing key area of ESG focus.

Online training on Applied Materials Supply Chain ESG.

Training through the RBA e Learning Academy and RBA workshops.

Ability to contract for social responsibility and sustainability assistance from a consultant at pre negotiated rates.

Our Applied commodity business managers are required to complete these trainings, assuring that the people who engage most frequently with our suppliers can knowledgeably communicate the business benefits of our sustainability expectations.

Our commitment to protecting human rights wherever we do business is detailed in the policies and statements listed on page 44.

We communicate our human rights commitments and requirements clearly to our supply chain and business partners to help ensure compliance with our expectations around humane treatment of the workforce and enforce the prohibition of forced and bonded labor.

We conduct due diligence on human rights risk in our supply chain and flag zero tolerance issues in our supplier scorecards.

View our Human Rights Statement of Principles here.

In 2022, a three phase project led by U.S. based Article One Advisors to identify human rights risks associated with our operations pinpointed risks of forced labor in our upstream information and communications technology supply chain.

GHG Scope 3 Supplier Survey To improve our Scope 3 emissions calculations in the future, we initiated a survey in 2022 of 102 top suppliers.

Questions gauged their own Scope 1 and 2 emissions and the maturity of their GHG reduction plans and goals.

Suppliers were provided webinar training and one on one support to better understand how to measure and track their emissions and energy use.

Applied plans to scale this effort to more suppliers in coming years.

In FY22, we conducted 24 supplier focused webinars across two time zones, featuring internal and external speakers discussing key areas of ESG focus.

Applied Materials is unequivocally committed to protecting human rights and conducting business in an ethical and responsible manner around the world.

We condemn and are committed to ending forced and bonded labor in all its forms, including child labor, indentured labor, slavery and human trafficking.

Risk Assessment Applied uses the RBA Risk Assessment Model to conduct due diligence around supply chain sustainability.

We begin the assessment process by compiling a list of all supplier sites in the top 80% of spend and high risk sites in the top 95%.

High risk was defined using the RBA Country Risk Assessment Tool, R1, which classifies country risk as low, medium, high and extreme based on indices of governance, human rights and conflict risk.

Other risks we considered included prevalence of foreign migrant workers, potential risks discovered in our targeted working conditions audit (embedded in our Applied supplier quality audits), suppliers flagged in the media for poor working conditions, and others.

Approximately half of our planned audits were conducted in FY22, with the remainder scheduled for FY23.

In 2023, we will also launch our first RBA risk assessment audits for selected tier 2 suppliers.

Remediation Directly, or through our third party consulting partner, we work with suppliers identified as posing ESG risks to answer any questions about the RBA audit protocol and to create corrective action plans.

Our suppliers are required to close out all priority and major risk findings within the suggested RBA timeline.

In 2022, exceptions were made to accommodate COVID shutdowns.

Responsible Minerals Sourcing Applied Materials is committed to the responsible sourcing of minerals used in our products.

Key to this commitment is our policy around the sourcing of tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, commonly referred to as 3TG or conflict minerals for their frequent origin in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries, and other conflict affected and high risk areas (CAHRAs).

Since 2019, Applied Materials has retained a third party service provider to assist in conducting outreach to suppliers regarding their use of 3TG and evaluating their responses.

Our commitment to improving transparency within the 3TG supply chain includes direct smelter engagement.

Our SuCCESS2030 team works directly with 17 smelters or refiners to ensure their continued participation in the RMI Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) program.

Additionally, our SuCCESS2030 lead is the current co chair of the Responsible Minerals Initiative Smelter Engagement Team (RMI SET), on which three Applied employees serve in a voluntary capacity.

Applied is helping to set direction and guide smelter engagement through increased interest and scrutiny regarding responsible minerals.

For more information about our 3TG due diligence, please refer to our Conflict Minerals Report.

Conformant smelters are those that have successfully completed an assessment against the applicable RMAP standard or equivalent.

Active smelters have committed to undergo an RMAP assessment, completed the relevant documents, and scheduled the on site assessment.

Eligible smelters meet the RMI’s definition of a smelter.

Our precision products require carefully designed packaging to avoid damage from shock and vibration during transport.

Our Design for Distribution task force plans and develops smarter packaging strategies that meet those demands while improving sustainability via materials reduction, improved recyclability and reusability.

In 2022, greater than 70% of our packaging materials were made from recyclable materials (polyethylene, polypropylene, corrugated fiberboard, steel and wood), many of which are also reusable.

For supplier sourced packaging, we maintain specifications that prohibit the use of certain packaging materials (including polystyrene) and are in the process of rolling out requirements for suppliers to report materials data, improving our ability to track our packaging’s recyclable content.

We are developing processes to track and enforce compliance with those specifications.

Hybrid Crate Design For lighter product shipments, we employ hybrid crates that pair a wooden base with a corrugated kraft board top and full moisture barrier bagging inside.

Offering a 50% reduction in packaging weight, these designs save the equivalent of 3,917 trees annually, trim transport emissions and packaging material cost, ease recycling, and increase safety for freight handlers.

Use of hybrid crates in 2022 saved 1 million in materials and reduced wood weight by 900,000 pounds.

Lighter Polyethylene Bags To save materials, we are moving from 6 mil to 4 mil thickness for low density cleanroom polyethylene (LDPE) bags in our Austin and Singapore manufacturing operations.

In 2022, we achieved an approximate 33% reduction in materials, avoiding 101,000 pounds of plastic.

For 2023, we are working to assure that all bags achieve 4 mil thickness or less, thereby avoiding 215,000 pounds of plastic.

Just Strong Enough Crates Where earlier wooden crate designs tended to be overbuilt for most use cases, our new, lighter crates are matched to the precise needs of individual products.

In 2022, this strategy saved some 956,000 pounds of wooden crate materials.

Reusable Packaging A collaborative effort between our packaging, logistics, supply chain and quality teams and our crating vendor is working on a reuse ROI and sustainable process for returning and reusing crates sent to Applied’s factories by one of our contract manufacturers.

Reusable Packaging Labels Labels communicate to the end user that our packaging is reusable and must not be discarded.

Waste Reduction To keep our packaging out of landfills, Applied prohibits the use of non recyclable and environmentally burdening materials such as polystyrene, PVC and toxic foams.

Packaging ESG Dashboard An in progress initiative is using existing shipment management systems (SMS) and SAP systems to develop measurement dashboards detailing our packaging’s ESG impact.

No Crate Needed Delivery Our Tainan Manufacturing Center factory in Taiwan is reducing the use of packing crates altogether by trucking products directly to local customers.

Having real world impact on packaging waste requires real world insight into how much protection individual products need, where we’re shipping them, and what the capacities are for recycling and reuse in those locations.

Then, we design the most resource efficient packaging and processes to match.

Common point of use (POU) packaging, used for interplant handling of fragile parts into cleanrooms, is die cut virgin polyethylene foam inserts placed in a polypropylene plastic corrugated box.

To reduce environmental impacts, we are working to replace this plastic with a solution that combines the box and foam into a single 100% recycled polyethylene pack.

We have begun piloting this solution with select high volume repairable parts for the repair return cycle, with completion of the pilot run expected in 2023.

Supplier Diversity To broaden the impact of our inclusion and diversity commitment, Applied Materials works to build diversity in our supply chain, both through onboarding women and minority owned suppliers and through encouraging equitable hiring practices across our supply base.

Our supplier diversity program is one of the main pillars of our SuCCESS2030 initiative, and in 2022 we met our goal of increasing diverse spend to 2.5% of our total global supplier spend, achieving 462 million spending with certified diverse suppliers.

For 2023, we’re seeking to raise that number past 500 million.

Our goal is to reach 1 billion in diverse spend by 2027 by setting goals for senior supply chain executives, continuing our visits to potential diverse suppliers, increasing our involvement in capacity building for diverse suppliers, and integrating more inclusive recruiting and onboarding practices for potential suppliers.

We will also work toward further embedding supplier diversity into our corporate strategy and culture.

Beyond pure spend, we also partner with applicable existing suppliers to pursue their diversity certifications through the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) and the National Minority Supplier Diversity Council (NMSDC). To achieve local impact, we are exploring community educational initiatives in FY23 to boost diverse owned companies with potential to join the semiconductor industry.

Applied Materials’ diverse suppliers must be certified by a third party auditor as being at least 51% diverse owned, controlled and operated by U.S. minorities (African American Black, Hispanic Latino, Native American, Asian Pacific American, Asian Indian American), women, minority women, LGBTQ , persons with disabilities, veterans or service disabled veterans.

Applied Materials also tracks additional diverse suppliers who could potentially be registered as diverse if they proceed with certification.

As a founding member of SEMI’s Manufacturing Ownership Diversity (MOD) working group, Applied Materials is working to provide best practices for supplier diversity in the semiconductor industry.

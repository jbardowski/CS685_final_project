Chairman’s letter

Novartis delivered a solid perfor-
mance in 2021. Strong demand for 
heart failure medicine Entresto, 
psoriasis and autoimmune disease 
treatment Cosentyx, and recently 
launched therapies such as multiple 
sclerosis drug  Kesimpta helped us 
increase sales and net profit as we 
maintained cost discipline. Looking 
ahead, we are confident we can 
maintain our momentum as we remain 
focused on operational excellence 
and science-based innovation. 

future amid the rising global need for 
innovative chronic therapies as we 
continue to strengthen patient 
engagement. 

We started a strategic review of our 
Sandoz generics division with the 
goal of strengthening its operational 
performance and maximizing share-
holder return. Also, we divested our 
investment in Roche Holding AG, 
reflecting our strategy to create a 
focused medicines company.

With more than 12 new drug approvals 
by the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion in the past five years, we are 
committed to our long-term research 
and development (R&D) strategy, 
which is aimed at creating break-
through therapies for patients with 
high unmet medical needs. We strive 
to build leading market positions in 
fast-growing areas of medicine and 
broaden patient reach to deliver on 
our purpose to improve and extend 
people’s lives around the world. 

Acute pressure on societies and 
healthcare systems due to the COVID-
19 pandemic remains high. In this 
challenging environment, our focus 
on operational excellence and shift 
to flexible working by our employees 
continued to help us navigate the 
crisis. In a post-pandemic world, these 
lessons will enable us to maintain high 
levels of resilience and operational 
efficiency while continuing to position 
us as an employer of choice in a 
changing work environment.

Last year we continued to make 
significant investments in R&D, 
including in cutting-edge medical 
technologies such as radioligand 
therapy and small-interfering RNA. 
Our clinical pipeline covers a diverse 
area of noncommunicable diseases 
such as cancer and heart disease. 
This is positioning us well for the 

We also made further progress in our 
environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) activities, which are an essen-
tial part of our strategy and an impor-
tant reputation driver. Besides our 
progress in reducing our environmen-
tal footprint, we broadened patient 
access to our strategic medicines and 
launched a new program in the United 

States to address health disparities 
– all with the intention to create more 
equitable and sustainable healthcare 
systems and support the United 
Nations’ efforts to achieve the 
 Sustainable Development Goals.

The Board of Directors took further 
action to strengthen governance. 
We paved the way for comprehensive 
ESG oversight and changed the 
leadership of the Compensation 
Committee and the Governance, 
Nomination and Corporate Responsi-
bilities Committee. We also nominated 
a new Board member. Together with 
the Executive Committee, the Board 
of Directors will continue the intensive 
dialogue with all stakeholder groups 
with a view to further strengthen trust 
in society and to maximize share-
holder return.

I thank you for the confidence you 
have placed in our company and am 
pleased to be able to propose a 
dividend increase of 3.3% to CHF 3.10 
at the next Annual General Meeting. 

Sincerely,

Our impact on the world remains 
extraordinary, with 766 million 
patients reached in 2021

CEO’s letter

2021 was another year of rapid change 
for the biopharmaceutical industry and 
the world. The pandemic continues to 
disrupt care for patients across the 
spectrum of disease, creating a 
syndemic, or confluence of epidemics, 
that requires healthcare systems to 
cope with COVID-19 while caring for 
patients with chronic diseases.

Through the challenges ahead, there 
are reasons to be optimistic a health-
ier future is within our grasp – includ-
ing the ways our industry has brought 
to this crisis the power of technology 
and shown once again the extraordi-
nary ability of science to overcome 
humanity’s greatest tests. 

As we reimagine medicine at Novartis, 
our unwavering focus on our strategy 
and purpose enabled us to continue 
creating value for patients, healthcare 
professionals, healthcare systems, 
employees, shareholders and society. 

The adaptability and commitment of our 
employees, together with the resilience 
of our operations and capabilities in 
data science and tech nology, minimized 
disruptions to our business. Many 
changes, such as hybrid working, are 
now business as usual.  

Our impact on the world remains 
extraordinary, with 766 million 
patients reached in 2021. We received 
21 approvals in the US, the EU, Japan 
and China, including two new mole-
cular entities. Our siRNA therapy 
Leqvio is now approved in more than 
50 countries, including the US. We 
also demonstrated the strength of our 
in-market portfolio, with medicines 
like Cosentyx, Entresto, Zolgensma, 
Kesimpta and Kisqali driving growth. 

Our pipeline promises innovation for 
years to come. We have built depth in 
five therapeutic areas and are building 
scale in five next-generation technol-
ogy platforms. 2021 saw important 
data readouts, including for Kisqali in 
HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, 
and for 177Lu-PSMA-617, our investiga-
tional targeted radioligand therapy for 
patients with advanced prostate 
cancer, which received breakthrough 
therapy designation by the US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA). We 
also received approval for Scemblix, a 
novel stamp inhibitor for the treatment 
of chronic myeloid leukemia. 

We have a promising mid- and late-
stage portfolio, with more than 20 
assets with expected approval by 
2026 that each have sales potential 
over USD 1 billion. We also initiated a 
share buyback of up to USD 15 billion, 
underscoring our confidence in our 
mid- and long-term pipeline and 
growth outlook.

Progressing on our journey to build 
trust with society and furthering our 
legacy in global health and access, in 
2021 Novartis reached the milestone 
of delivering a staggering 1 billion 
courses of malaria treatment to 
people in endemic countries. We 
continue delivering on our longstand-
ing commitment to expand access, 
narrowing the time it takes to scale 
our latest innovations. Our progress 
was underscored by improved envi-
ronmental, social and governance 
(ESG) ratings, and we once again 
ranked second in the Access to 
Medicine Index.

integrating our data and digital teams 
within Customer & Technology 
Solutions to maximize efficiency as 
we scale value-driving projects. For 
example, AI Nurse, developed in 
collaboration with Tencent, helps 
patients with heart failure and other 
cardiovascular diseases manage 
disease progression. It is used by 
300 000 patients in China.

Novartis also continued doing our part 
to end the pandemic, quickly scaling 
up production of COVID-19 vaccines. 
We’re proud to have helped develop a 
potential new treatment option with 
Molecular Partners. 

Our financial performance highlights 
the progress we’ve made and drives 
confidence for the future – with 4% 
growth in net sales and 6% growth in 
core operating income from the 
previous year. We’re confident we’ll 
drive consistent growth to 2030 and 
beyond. We’ve also initiated a strate-
gic review of Sandoz to enable 
Sandoz to be positioned as a long-
term leader in the generics industry. 

Emerging from the COVID-19 pande-
mic, I remain optimistic about a new 
era in medicine. Stakeholders like you 
play an important role in that. On 
behalf of all of us at Novartis, we’re 
grateful for your contributions on the 
journey of reimagining medicine.    

Sincerely, 

We continued to go big on data 
science and digital technologies,

Chief Executive Officer

Our business environment

The need for high-quality healthcare has never been more urgent or important. People 
around the world are living longer, fueling a rise in chronic diseases and pressuring healthcare 
systems to restrain spending growth. At the same time, digital technology and a deeper 
understanding of the root causes of disease are accelerating medical innovation and opening 
new possibilities to improve the lives of patients. 

Healthcare demand is expected  
to rise post-COVID-19

Use of data and technology is  
expanding across our industry

Global demand for healthcare and associated spending 
is expected to grow over the next five years, supported 
by renewed economic growth and increased investment 
in healthcare in many countries after the COVID-19 
pandemic. We see growth for our business in many 
markets, including in the US and – over the longer term – 
in China. At the same time, pressure on pharmaceutical 
pricing is expected to continue as payers step up 
initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare.

The use of data science and technologies such as 
artificial intelligence is increasing rapidly across 
our industry – in everything from clinical trials and 
manufacturing to patient diagnostics and treatment. 
COVID-19 has accelerated this trend. Meanwhile, 
customers want more efficient and personalized ways 
to connect with pharmaceutical companies. Against 
this backdrop, data privacy and cybersecurity are 
growing in importance. 

3–6%

65%

The global medicines market is expected to grow at between 3–6% 
CAGR through 2025, according to IQVIA, a research firm. Growth in 
non-COVID-19 spending is expected to return to its pre-pandemic 
outlook by 2023. In China, spending on medicines is predicted to 
exceed USD 170 billion by 2025.

According to a 2021 survey by Deloitte, nearly two-thirds of doctors, 
nurses and other healthcare professionals in the EU have increased 
their use of digital technology to support clinicians’ new ways of 
working.

Innovation continues  
to accelerate

Medical innovation is accelerating, as technologies such 
as gene therapy and ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapies 
open new paths to scientific discovery. Increased 
co operation within the industry could lead to a new era 
of open science. At the same time, innovation is getting 
harder, with new discoveries requiring significant long-
term investment. 

Access to healthcare remains  
a global challenge

Almost a third of the world’s population does not have 
access to the medicines they need. For the past five 
years, access rates in the poorest countries have been 
declining. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has 
highlighted deep health inequities in both developed 
and developing countries. 

123 bn

In 2020, spending on research and development by the world’s 
15 leading pharmaceutical companies reached USD 123 billion, 
an increase of 43% since 2015, according to research published in 
2021 by IQVIA.

2 bn

The number of people who lack access to essential medicines, 
according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Aging and other factors are 
changing the disease burden

As the complexity of the world’s healthcare challenges 
grows, the nature of the global disease burden is also 
changing. Aging populations and lifestyle changes are 
fueling a rise in noncommunicable conditions such as 
cardiovascular disease and cancer, driving an increase 
in disability and early death, and putting additional 
pressure on healthcare systems. 

New ways of working are here to  
stay after COVID-19 

COVID-19 changed our work habits. Post-pandemic,  
many employees continue to want more flexibility in 
how they work. Within our own workforce, there is more 
emphasis on digital skills. At the same time, workplace 
diversity is more important than ever to attract and 
retain talented employees, and support innovation.

71%

74%

Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are responsible for 71% of 
global deaths, according to the WHO.  Cardiovascular diseases 
account for most NCD deaths, followed by cancer, respiratory 
diseases, and diabetes.

Nearly three-quarters of workers want a mix of office-based and 
remote working, according to a 2021 survey by Accenture. Research 
also shows more flexible working can bring cost benefits for employers 
and can help companies widen their talent pool.

Climate crisis threatens to  
undermine global health gains 

Opportunity to build public 
trust in the wake of the pandemic

Climate change is already causing extreme heat and poor 
air quality in some areas, which threaten to exacerbate 
pre-existing health conditions such as respiratory 
diseases. In addition, an increase in temperature and 
humidity may cause a proliferation of insects that carry 
vector-borne diseases, including dengue fever and malaria. 
Ultimately, climate change could undermine decades 
of progress in improving human health at a time when 
antimicrobial resistance is also rising. 

COVID-19 has brought an opportunity to reset public trust 
in our industry, with companies working together to end 
the pandemic. Trust matters for our industry: Our success 
depends on patents and trademarks that are granted by 
society and protect the long-term investments required for 
our business. Trust also matters for patient engagement, 
for working with regulators and policymakers, and for 
attracting talented employees. 

250 000

57%

Between 2030 and 2050, the WHO expects climate change will 
cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths each year – from 
malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress alone. 

Worldwide, trust in pharmaceutical companies stood at 57% in 2021, 
according to the Edelman Trust Barometer. Trust improved in the US, 
Germany, the UK and Italy, from 2020, though from relatively low levels.

Our 2021 materiality assessment

Every four years we conduct a detailed materiality assess-
ment to identify issues that matter most to our stakehold-
ers, and where we have the most potential to create value 
aligned with our purpose. The assessment informs our 
strategy and our reporting on ESG topics, and guides our 
impact performance measurement. 

Our latest materiality assessment, conducted in 2021, was 
based on a survey of more than 500 external stakeholders 
and 12 000 internal stakeholders, and 140 follow-up 
interviews. 

External stakeholders were drawn from our main stake-
holder groups, including patients, customers, partners and 
shareholders. Internal stakeholders – including senior 
management – were drawn from across our business 

divisions. Participants were asked to rank the impact of 
Novartis across eight impact clusters. Results can be 
seen in the chart below.

Overall, results were in line with our previous materiality 
assessment conducted in 2017 and were consistent 
across stakeholder groups: patient safety, access to 
healthcare, innovation and ethical business practices 
were again ranked highly. Although environmental sus-
tainability was ranked lower than other impact clusters,  
it remains an essential component of our strategy and 
operating model.

Our strategy

Our strategy is to build a focused medicines company powered by technology leadership in 
research and development, world-class commercialization, global access and data science. 
As we implement this strategy, we have five priorities to help shape our decision-making and 
ensure we continue to deliver on our purpose.

Our strategic priorities

Deliver transformative 
innovation

Embrace operational 
excellence

Go big on data  
and digital

Unleash the power 
of our people

Build trust 
with society

We strive to improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of 
our operations while maintaining 
high standards of patient safety, 
product quality and environmental 
sustainability. These activities 
underpin our investments in 
innovation and support our 
financial performance, while 
helping to build trust with society.

Our aim is to transform Novartis 
into a medicines company 
powered by data science and 
digital technologies. 

Using data, we believe, can 
improve efficiency, drive sales and 
spur innovation to enhance our 
pipeline of new medicines and 
improve outcomes for patients.

In our commercial operations, 
we aim to consistently deliver 
successful launches enabling 
broad and rapid access to our 
medicines.

To do this, we are embracing 
data analytics and technologies 
such as artificial intelligence 
while partnering with technology 
companies both large and small.

Our manufacturing operations 
are evolving as we invest in 
new technologies to improve 
productivity and respond to the 
changing business environment. 

We also work to ensure the ethical 
and responsible use of new 
technologies and  
prioritize effective data privacy  
and cybersecurity.

We continue to transform our 
business services and technology 
functions to enable the execution 
of our strategy and drive 
profitable growth.

We seek to find new ways to 
cure disease, intervene earlier 
in chronic illnesses, and improve 
patients’ quality of life. 

Our research and development 
(R&D) programs stand to 
help millions of people living 
with cancer, heart disease, 
neurological conditions and 
immune system disorders, as well 
as a variety of other diseases. 

We prioritize projects with 
the potential to transform the 
standard of care for patients, 
and we are investing in new 
technology platforms – including 
cell and gene therapies, RNA 
therapies, and radioligand 
therapies – that offer more 
targeted approaches to fighting 
and, in some cases, potentially 
curing serious diseases.  

Our focus on transformative 
innovation is expected to drive 
above-sector sales growth. By 
2026, we anticipate approval of 
more than 20 pipeline assets 
with the potential to become 
blockbuster medicines with 
annual sales of more than  
USD 1 billion.

We continue to transform our 
corporate culture to support our 
long-term performance. 

We want every employee to 
feel inspired by our purpose, be 
curious about new ideas, and 
work in an unbossed environment 
that encourages initiative and 
teamwork. 

We are exploring new ways of 
working, post-pandemic, to give 
employees greater flexibility and 
ensure we continue to attract and 
retain world-class talent. 

At the same time, we are 
making progress in diversity and 
inclusion to increase employee 
engagement and support 
innovation.

Building trust with patients, 
customers, partners, our 
employees and society is critical 
to delivering on our purpose. 

It defines our approach 
to managing our key 
environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) topics: 
being part of the solution on 
pricing and access, addressing 
global health challenges, being 
a responsible citizen, and 
holding ourselves to high ethical 
standards. 

We strive to make our medicines 
accessible to as many people 
as possible, while embedding 
ethics across our business, 
reducing our environmental 
footprint, and helping to 
address global issues such as 
antimicrobial resistance.

We take a systematic approach, 
integrating our ESG priorities 
across our strategy with 
clear targets and reporting. 
Please see page 16 for more 
information on our ESG 
management targets.

We have made 
significant progress 
since we launched our 
strategy in 2018.
We have improved the productivity of our 
R&D pipeline, delivered cost savings, and 
ramped up our investments in data and dig-
ital. We have also made important progress 
in providing access to our medicines, and 
further strengthened our approach to 
ethics and compliance. 

For more information on our performance 
against our strategy, see pages 28-86.

Our medicines positively impact society by 
improving and extending the lives of 
hundreds of millions of people around the 
world. Through our business, we also 
create jobs and contribute to employee 
development – both in our own operations 
and across our supply chain. At the same 
time, our business impacts the environ-
ment through carbon emissions, water use 
and waste. For more information on how 
we assess the impact of our business on 
society, please see the section “Measuring 
and valuing our impact.”

Contributing to  
the UN SDGs

We are committed to supporting the 
United Nations’ Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs). An analysis by Trucost, a 
third-party sustainability data provider, 
showed that our most significant positive 
impact is on goal 3 (good health and 
well-being), which aligns closely with  
our purpose. 

We also positively impact goal 8 (decent 
work and economic growth), goal 9 
(industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 
goal 10 (reduced inequalities) through our 
business and operations, including our 
efforts to expand access to our medicines. 
Through our environmental targets, we 
contribute to goal 6 (clean water and 
sanitation), goal 7 (affordable and clean 
energy) and goal 13 (climate action).

Measuring and valuing 
our impact

Impact valuation is an emerging 
discipline that seeks to measure the 
positive and negative effects of 
companies on society. Novartis is 
pioneering an approach called social, 
environmental and economic (SEE) 
impact valuation that aims to show the 
positive impact we bring to countries, 
health systems and individuals, 
balanced by the negative impact of 
our operations on the environment 
and other areas. Expressing these 
impacts in monetary terms makes 
them transparent and comparable  
for stakeholders.

Our latest SEE impact valuation figures 
for 2020 take into account the social 
impact of our Innovative Medicines  
and Sandoz product portfolio in 131 
countries. We also assessed our 
impact on living wages and employee 
development in our own operations 
and in our supply chain, as well as  
our contributions to gross domestic 
product and employment in the 
countries in which we operate.

At the same time, we measured the 
negative impact of our business on 
occupational safety – both in our own 
operations and across our supply 
chain – as well as the negative impact 
of carbon and other greenhouse gas 
emissions, land use, water use and 
waste. Minimizing risks associated 
with third parties in our supply chain 
and improving environmental sustain-
ability are key parts of our strategy 
and operating model. For more 
information, please see the section 
“Embrace operational excellence.”

While impact valuation methodology  
is still evolving, our efforts are based 
on current leading approaches. For 
example, we engage with WifOR, an 
independent economic research 
institute, to calculate the social impact 
of our medicines, our direct GDP 
contribution, and our indirect and 
induced environmental and economic 
impacts. We are also a founding 
member of the Value Balancing 
Alliance (VBA), a nonprofit organiza-
tion that aims to create a standard for 
measuring and disclosing the value 
companies provide to society. With 
the exception of the social impact of 

our medicines, which is specific to  
our industry, all other reported impact 
indicators are subject to standardiza-
tion through the VBA.

We first applied our impact valuation 
methodology in 2016. Since then, 
we have further developed the 
approach and expanded its scope. 
SEE impact valuation results have 
been used by Novartis teams for 
stakeholder engagement and busi-
ness decision-making.

We also engage with stakeholders  
to raise awareness of impact valuation 
and promote standardization. In  
2021, we hosted our fourth annual 
Co- Creating Impact Summit with 
more than 1 800 participants from 
academia, industry, the investment 
community and other areas.

How we manage risk

Our strategy brings opportunities for our stakeholders and society – for example, by 
creating new medical breakthroughs or expanding access to our medicines. At the same 
time, our strategy also carries risks. Many of these relate to our business environment, such 
as the uncertainty inherent in research and development (R&D), or changing societal 
expectations of our industry. 

Our approach to risk 

The Novartis Enterprise Risk Manage-
ment (ERM) framework is designed to 
generate a holistic view of risks for 
the company and drive a culture of 
smart risk-taking. While our Code of 
Ethics sets the ethical framework for 
all employees to manage risk across 
our business, risk management is a 
fundamental leadership responsibility 
that involves active engagement by 
leaders at each stage of the process. 

The overall ERM process is the 
responsibility of the Chief Ethics, Risk 
& Compliance Officer, with oversight 
from the Executive Committee of 
Novartis and the Board of Directors. 
For further details on governance of 

risk at Novartis, please see the 
section “Our corporate governance 
approach.”

Our ERM framework is aligned with 
our strategic planning and helps us 
better understand our overall level of 
risk exposure. The Risk & Resilience 
team conducts risk workshops and 
collaborates with all risk assurance 
functions to identify key risks across 
the company. Each Novartis unit 
organizes a focused risk workshop  
at the leadership level.  In parallel,  
risk workshops are held in our largest 
markets by revenue and in certain 
focus markets. 

The outcomes of these workshops are 
consolidated into the Novartis Risk 

Compass, which groups risks into 
three categories: strategic, operational 
and emerging. Risks are rated based 
on likelihood and potential impact over 
the next five years, using the “most-
probable worst-case” scenario for 
each risk as a reference point. Once 
key risks are identified, mitigation 
plans are created. In addition to the 
three categories described above, we 
identify separate “awareness topics” 
that we believe may become new risks 
over time. 

The Risk Compass helps senior 
management and our Board of Direc-
tors focus discussions on key risks and 
align strategy with risk exposure. We 
regularly monitor risks and revise our 
assessments, if necessary. 

Novartis Risk Compass

Strategic risks
are the most consequential to our ability  
to execute our strategy or achieve our  
business objectives.

Emerging risks
require close monitoring and have  
the potential to become strategic or 
operational risks.

Operational risks
relate to internal processes or systems, 
employee errors or external events. 

Awareness topics
are longer-term trending topics that have 
the potential to become new risks.

Risks in 2021

Our risk portfolio covers 20 risks. Of 
these, seven are categorized as strate-
gic, nine as operational, and the remain-
ing four as emerging. In addition, we 
have identified four awareness topics. 

Overall, our 2021 risk portfolio is 
broadly consistent with the previous 
year. “Sandoz business transforma-
tion” was added as a new strategic 
risk in 2021, reflecting the increasingly 
competitive environment for generic 
medicines. Additionally, “facility and 

workplace safety” was renamed 
“occupational health and workplace 
safety” in 2021 to incorporate aspects 
of the post-pandemic working envi-
ronment – such as employee well-
being – that were identified as an 
emerging risk in 2020.

Failure or delay in the 
research and development 
of new products or new 
indications for existing 
products

We engage in costly, lengthy and uncertain R&D activities, 
both independently and in collaboration with third parties, to 
identify and develop new products and new indications for 
existing products. Failure can occur at any point, including 
after substan tial investment. New products must undergo 
intensive preclinical and clinical testing. Further, regulatory 
authorities continue to establish new and increasingly 
rigorous requirements for approval and reimbursement.  
The post-approval regulatory burden has also increased.

• Enter into agreements with other pharmaceutical 

and biotechnology companies and with academic 
and other institutions to develop new products

•  Accelerate the use of data science and digital 
technology to make the drug discovery and 
development process more efficient and effective   

Emerging business 
models 

Missed opportunities in 
digitalization and emerging 
business models

Rapid adoption of digital technology is transforming our 
industry. There is a risk of Novartis missing the opportunity 
while other companies with specialized expertise or 
business models may enter the healthcare field, potentially 
disrupting our relationships with patients, healthcare 
professionals, customers, distributors and suppliers. 

• Develop a digital operating model to enable faster 
innovation, simplify our operations and improve 
productivity

•  Accelerate the implementation of a new customer 
engagement model, which combines traditional 
face-to-face visits with virtual engagements with 
healthcare professionals. We are similarly changing 
our approach to partnering with healthcare systems, 
payers and other healthcare providers.  

Embrace operational excellence

Build trust with society

Key products and 
commercial priorities 

Failure to deliver key 
commercial priorities and 
successfully launch new 
products 

Our ability to grow our business depends on the commercial 
success of key products. Their success could be impacted 
by a number of factors, including pressure from new or 
existing competitive products; changes in the prescribing 
habits of healthcare professionals; unexpected side effects 
or safety signals; supply chain issues or other product 
shortages; pricing pressures; regulatory proceedings; 
changes in labeling; loss of intellectual property protection; 
and global pandemics.  

•  Pursue a “launch excellence” strategy in commercial 
execution, including investing earlier in pre-launch 
activities and using data science to test and learn 
from new commercial models 

•  Accelerate the implementation of a new customer 
engagement model, which combines traditional 
face-to-face visits with virtual engagements with 
healthcare professionals. We are similarly changing 
our approach to partnering with healthcare systems, 
payers and other healthcare providers.   

Alliances, acquisitions 
and divestments

Failure to identify external 
business opportunities or 
realize the expected 
benefits from our strategic 
acquisitions or 
divestments 

As part of our strategy, we acquire and divest products or 
entire businesses, and enter into strategic alliances and 
collaborations. This strategy depends in part on our ability 
to identify and move forward with strategic opportunities. 
Efforts to develop and market acquired products, to 
integrate acquired businesses or to achieve expected 
synergies may fail or may not fully meet expectations. Also, 
our strategic alliances and collaborations with third parties 
may not achieve their intended goals and objectives. 

•  Establish an enterprise-wide business development 
strategy to identify external opportunities that align 
with and advance our corporate strategy  

•  Enhance our risk-based due diligence approach 

through end-to-end risk management

Sandoz business 
transformation

Inability to drive 
sustainable growth 
mid-term by pursuing 
biosimilars and inorganic 
growth opportunities

Our Sandoz Division faces competition and pricing 
pressures as it seeks to increase its market share and 
achieve sustainable and profitable growth mid-term.  
Our strategy for Sandoz focuses on accelerating bio -
similars growth in the long term; rebuilding the Sandoz  
US business; and achieving inorganic growth by identifying 
and successfully executing on merger and acquisition and 
strategic in-licensing partnership opportunities. Failure to 
achieve these goals may have a material adverse effect  
on the success of the Sandoz Division and the Group as  
a whole, as well as potentially on our results of operations 
and financial condition. 

•  Accelerate biosimilars growth 

•  Rebuild the US business by increasing loss-of-

exclusivity coverage and enhancing our pipeline 
with first-to-file launches 

•  Pursue inorganic growth opportunities, for example 

through bolt-on acquisitions and in-licensing

Pricing, reimburse-
ment and access 

Pricing and reimbursement 
pressure, including access 
to healthcare

We experience significant pressures on the pricing of our 
products and on our ability to obtain and maintain 
satisfactory rates of reimbursement from governments, 
insurers and other payers. These pressures have many 
sources, including rising healthcare costs (exacerbated by 
the COVID-19 pandemic); funding restrictions and policy 
changes; and public controver sies, debate, investigations 
and legal proceedings around pharma ceutical pricing. Such 
pressures may impact product pricing and market access. 
We also face price controls and other measures imposed by 
governments and other payers. In addition, our Sandoz 
Division faces continued price erosion in the generics and 
biosimilars segment. 

•  Establish dedicated teams that actively seek to 
optimize patient access, including formulary 
positions, for our products 

•  Increase efforts to enable patient access through 
innovative pricing and access initiatives in the US, 
Europe and other markets, including contract 
structures such as pay-over-time and outcome-
based agreements 

•  Continue to execute against access-to-medicine 

and global health targets. These targets are backed 
by a sustainability-linked bond, which embeds them 
into the core of our business operations.

Environmental, social 
and governance 
matters 

Failure to meet increasingly 
challenging environmental, 
social and governance 
expectations

Increasingly, in addition to their financial performance, 
companies are being judged on their performance on a 
variety of environ mental, social and governance (ESG) 
matters. A variety of organizations measure the 
performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results 
of these assessments are widely publicized. In addition, 
investment in funds that specialize in companies that 
perform well in such assessments are increasingly popular, 
and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized 
the importance of such ESG measures in making their 
investment decisions. An inability to successfully perform 
on ESG matters and meet societal expectations can result 
in negative impacts to our reputation, recruitment, retention, 
operations, financial results and share price. 

•  Further develop the Novartis ESG strategy based on 
the results of the 2021 global materiality assessment  

•  Revisit and further strengthen our environmental 

target for full carbon neutrality by 2030 by 
committing to achieve net zero across the Novartis 
value chain by 2040

Financial performance

Novartis delivered a solid financial performance in 2021, supported by sales 
growth in key products and increased margins. These factors helped counter the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in some therapeutic areas and a challenging 
environment for our generics business.

Strong sales of key products contin-
ued to underpin our financial perfor-
mance in 2021. Novartis full-year net 
sales were USD 51.6 billion, up 4% 
from the prior year when measured in 
constant currencies (cc) to remove 
the impact of exchange rate move-
ments, and up 6% when measured in 
US dollar terms. The COVID-19 
pandemic continued to impact some 
therapeutic areas – most notably 
oncology and our generics business.

Sales of our heart failure medicine 
Entresto grew 40% (cc) to USD 3.5 
billion, driven by increased patient 
share across major markets. In 2021, 
Entresto received approval in the US 
for an expanded indication in chronic 
heart failure.

Cosentyx, our treatment for psoriasis 
and other autoimmune diseases, also 
continued to grow strongly. Sales rose 
17% (cc) from the prior year to USD 4.7 
billion, driven by demand in the US and 
Europe as well as strong volume growth 
in China. Meanwhile, Zolgensma, our 
gene therapy for children with spinal 
muscular atrophy, delivered sales of 
USD 1.4 billion, up 46% (cc), reaching 
blockbuster status for the first time.

Recently launched products also 
progressed well. Kesimpta, a treat-
ment for relapsing multiple sclerosis 
that was approved in Europe in 2021, 
had sales of USD 372 million, driven 
by launch uptake, strong access and 
increased demand. 

Our oncology products also con-
tributed to the solid performance. 
Promacta, a treatment for blood 
disorders that is known as Revolade 
outside the US, grew 15% (cc) to  
USD 2.0 billion. Kisqali, a breast 
cancer treatment, had sales of  
USD 937 million, up 36% (cc). Jakavi,  
a treatment for blood disorders and 

cancers, grew 16% (cc) to USD 1.6 
billion, showing double-digit growth 
across all regions. 

Sales of Sandoz biopharmaceuticals 
continued to be a bright spot, with a 
7% (cc) increase to USD 2.1 billion. 
However, that was countered by price 
competition and softer retail demand, 
including the impact of a weak cough 
and cold season, leading to an overall 
decline (–2%4 cc; 0% in US dollar 
terms) in Sandoz Division net sales.

Novartis Group sales in Europe, our 
largest market, grew 5% (cc). Sales  
in the US rose 2%. Sales in emerging 
growth markets grew 11% (cc), led by 
a double-digit increase in China.

Operating income was USD 11.7 billion, 
up 13% (cc) from the prior year, mainly 
driven by higher sales and lower legal 
expenses, partly offset by increased 
investments in marketing and sales and 
in research and development, and 
higher amortization. Net income was 
USD 24.0 billion, benefiting from the 
USD 14.6 billion gain from the divest-
ment of our investment in Roche. 
Earnings per share were USD 10.71.

To help people understand our under-

core results, which exclude the impact 
of amortization, restructurings, acqui-

Core operating income of USD 16.6 
billion rose 6% (cc). Core net income 
of USD 14.1 billion rose 5% (cc). Core 
earnings per share were USD 6.29,  
up 7% (cc). Free cash flow of USD 13.3 
billion was up 14%, driven by higher 
operating income adjusted for non-

legal provisions, partly offset by a 
USD 650 million upfront payment to 
in-license tislelizumab from an affiliate 
of BeiGene, Ltd.

Innovative Medicines
The Innovative Medicines (IM) Division 
includes the Novartis Oncology and 
Novartis Pharmaceuticals business 
units. Novartis Pharmaceuticals 
focuses on the franchises of Immunol-
ogy, Hepatology and Dermatology; 
Neuroscience; Ophthalmology; 
Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabo-
lism; Respiratory and Allergy; and 
Established Medicines. Novartis 
Oncology, which provides treatments 
for a variety of cancers and rare 
diseases, consists of the Hematology 
and Solid Tumor franchises.

The IM Division delivered net sales of 
USD 42.0 billion in 2021, an increase 
of 6% (cc) from the prior year. Overall, 
products that we consider our key 
growth drivers contributed 52% of IM 
net sales in 2021, compared with 44% 
in 2020, demonstrating our ability to 
renew our product portfolio and offset 
the impact of patent expirations. Core 
operating income for the IM Division 
was USD 15.2 billion, up 10% (cc).

Novartis Pharmaceuticals

The Novartis Pharmaceuticals business 
unit had net sales of USD 26.5 bil  lion 
in 2021, an increase of 7% (cc) from 
the prior year, supported by continued 
growth in key products across multi-
ple franchises.

Immunology, Hepatology and 
Dermatology
Sales reached USD 5.8 billion, an 
increase of 18% (cc) from the previous 
year. Cosentyx saw strong growth 
with sales of USD 4.7 billion, up 17% 
(cc). This was driven by sustained 
demand across indications in the US 
and Europe, as well as strong volume 
growth in China after the product was 
included in the country’s National 
Reimbursement Drug List. Sales of  
Ilaris reached USD 1.1 billion, up 22% 
(cc), with double-digit growth across 
all regions.

Neuroscience
Sales were USD 5.1 billion, increasing 
by 15% (cc), mainly due to expanded 
access in Europe and other markets 
for Zolgensma, as well as Kesimpta 
launch uptake. Zolgensma reached 
blockbuster status with sales of  
USD 1.4 billion, up 46% (cc). Sales of 
Kesimpta reached USD 372 million. 
Meanwhile, sales of Gilenya 
decreased 9% (cc) to USD 2.8 billion 
due to increased competition. 

Ophthalmology
Sales were USD 4.3 billion, declining 
by 4% (cc) from the previous year  
due to generic competition for our 
mature ophthalmology portfolio. 
Lucentis sales grew 8% (cc) to  
USD 2.2 billion. Xiidra sales grew 24% 
(cc) to USD 468 million. Beovu sales 
declined 3% (cc) to USD 186 million.

Cardiovascular, Renal and
Metabolism
Sales were USD 3.6 billion, up 40% 
(cc), driven by sustained growth for 
Entresto, which registered sales of 
USD 3.5 billion, up 40% (cc). Entresto 
was approved in the US in 2021 for an 
expanded indication in patients with 
left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF) below normal. It was also 
approved for the treatment of hyper-
tension (high blood pressure) in Japan 
and China. Meanwhile, Leqvio, our 
treatment for high cholesterol, regis-
tered sales of USD 12 million. Leqvio  
is approved in more than 45 countries, 
with most awaiting reimbursement.

Respiratory and Allergy
Sales were USD 2.1 billion, up 6% (cc). 
Xolair delivered 12% (cc) on-year 
growth with sales of USD 1.4 billion, 
mainly driven by the chronic sponta-
neous urticaria and severe allergic 
asthma indications. In 2021, Xolair was 
approved for self-injection in the US.

Established Medicines
Sales were USD 5.7 billion, down 10% 
(cc) from the previous year, as sales of 
established medicines such as Diovan 
and Galvus continued to de cline as a 
result of generic competition. 

Novartis Oncology

2021 news highlights

In February we were granted an 
expanded indication for Entresto by  
the US FDA, allowing for the treatment 
of most chronic heart failure patients, 
including all those with an ejection 
fraction below normal.

In March we received EU approval  
for Kesimpta for treatment of relapsing 
forms of multiple sclerosis in adults  
with active disease defined by clinical  
or imaging features. Kesimpta is the  
first B-cell therapy that can be self-
administered once-monthly at home.

In June we announced US approval  
for Cosentyx for treatment of children 
and adolescents with moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis – a chronic 
inflammatory disease that may impact 
up to 350 000 children worldwide,  
with onset most common during 
adolescence.

In October we received US approval 
for Scemblix for treatment of chronic 
myeloid leukemia (CML) in two distinct 
indications. It offers a new treatment 
option for CML patients who are 
resistant or intolerant to prior treatments.

In December we received US 
approval for our cholesterol-lowering 
medicine Leqvio. Separately, we 
announced in September a world-first 
agreement between Novartis and  
the National Health Service in England 
to enable broad and rapid access to 
Leqvio via a population health 
management approach.

The Novartis Oncology business unit 
delivered net sales of USD 15.5 billion, 
an increase of 4% (cc) from the prior 
year. The performance underscores 
the strength of our oncology portfolio, 
with solid growth in sales of key 
products.

Hematology
Sales were USD 8.4 billion, up 6% (cc) 
from the prior year. Promacta, which is 
known as Revolade outside the US, 
grew 15% (cc) to USD 2.0 billion, with 
double-digit growth across all regions, 
driven by increased use in chronic 
immune thrombocytopenia and as 
first-line treatment for severe aplastic 
anemia. Sales of Tasigna grew 4% (cc) 
to USD 2.1 billion, mainly driven by 
growth in emerging markets.

Jakavi showed double-digit growth 
across all regions to register sales of 
USD 1.6 billion, up 16% (cc) from the 
previous year, driven by strong demand 
in the myelofibrosis and polycythemia 
vera indications. Kymriah saw growth 
across all markets as coverage for the 
chimeric antigen receptor T-cell 
(CAR-T) therapy continued to expand, 
with sales of USD 587 million repre-
senting a 22% (cc) increase from the 
previous year.

Solid Tumor
Sales were USD 7.1 billion, up 2% (cc) 
from the previous year. The perfor-
mance was led by Kisqali, which 
continued to see growth across all 
regions with sales of USD 937 million, 
up 36% (cc). Taﬁnlar + Mekinist, a 
combination therapy, registered an 8% 
(cc) increase in sales to USD 1.7 billion 
as demand increased in the BRAF+ 
adjuvant melanoma and non-small cell 
lung cancer indications. Tabrecta 
registered USD 90 million in sales in its 
first full year after launch, as the lung 
cancer treatment continued to gain 
traction in the US. Meanwhile, sales of 
three products – Sandostatin, Aﬁnitor/
Votubia, and Votrient – declined due to 
increased competition in major markets.

2021 news highlights

Sandoz

In February we signed an agreement 
to acquire GlaxoSmithKline’s 
cephalosporin antibiotics business, 
reinforcing Sandoz’s leading global 
position in antibiotics.

In May we announced plans to further 
expand Sandoz antibiotics production 
capabilities in Kundl, Austria, and in 
Palafolls, Spain. By modernizing and 
simplifying its manufacturing setup, 
Sandoz will improve its ability to 
consistently deliver high-quality 
medicines to patients while remaining 
cost-competitive in the global market.

In June we announced the launch  
of generic oncology treatment 
pemetrexed in 11 countries across 
Europe, including Germany, 
Switzerland, and Spain.

The Sandoz Division is a global leader 
in generic pharmaceuticals and 
biosimilars, and sells products in  
more than 100 countries. The division 
has three global franchises: Retail 
Generics, Biopharmaceuticals and 
Anti-Infectives. 

Sandoz net sales were USD 9.6 billion 
in 2021, decreasing by 2%1 (cc) from 
the previous year, as volume growth in 
our Biopharmaceuticals and contract 
manufacturing businesses was offset 
by the effects of price competition 
and continued headwinds for our 
Retail Generics business in the US. 
We continued to see an impact from 
COVID-19, particularly in the Retail 
Generics and Anti-Infectives busi-
nesses. However, the effects have 
been more moderate in recent months 
and the Sandoz business is continuing 
to normalize.

Sandoz sales in Europe declined 2% 
(cc) due to the impact of COVID-19  
on the Retail Generics business.  
Sales in the US were down 15%. Core 
operating income was USD 2.1 billion, 
declining 14% (cc) from the previous 
year due to unfavorable gross margin 
and lower sales.

Sales in the Retail Generics business 
declined 4% (cc) to USD 7.1 billion, 
impacted primarily by continued sales 
volume decline in the US for oral 
solids as a result of partnership 
terminations.  

Sales in the Biopharmaceuticals 
franchise grew 7% (cc) to USD 2.1 
bil lion, driven by continued growth 
outside the US. Sandoz develops, 
manufactures and markets protein- 
and other biotechnology-based 
products, including biosimilars, and 
provides biotechnology manufacturing 
services to other companies.

In Anti-Infectives, Sandoz manufactures 
and supplies active pharmaceutical 
ingredients and intermediates, mainly 
antibiotics, for use by the Retail 
Generics franchise and for sale to 
third-party customers. Total franchise 
sales were USD 1.1 billion, a decrease 
of 5% (cc) from the prior year. 

In 2021, Novartis announced that it 
will commence a strategic review of 
the Sandoz Division. The review will 
explore all options, ranging from 
retaining the business to separation, 
to determine how to best maximize 
value for our shareholders.

and development programs

Clinical data readouts
in 2021, paving the way for further 
launches in 2022 and beyond 

Our approach to R&D

The COVID-19 pandemic is only one 
example of the enormous burden that 
disease puts on society. From leading 
causes of death such as heart dis-
ease and cancer, to rare but debilitat-
ing genetic disorders, the disability 
and mortality associated with serious 
illness harms economic growth and 
exacerbates social inequality.  

Finding solutions to these problems 
is why Novartis exists. Our more than 
20 000 employees in research and 
development (R&D) work to discover 
and develop medicines for diseases 
with high unmet need. Our R&D teams 
have built depth in core disease areas 
including cardiovascular and renal, 
oncology, hematology, immunology 
and neuroscience, while we maintain 
innovative investigational and in- 
market programs in ophthalmology 
and respiratory-allergy. We are also 
advancing our pipeline of investiga-
tional medicines for malaria and other 
neglected diseases. 

With our strong capabilities across 
five platforms – chemical biology, 
biotherapeutics (biologics), radioli-
gand therapy, cell therapy and gene 
therapy – we have a unique founda-
tion to address disease burdens faced 
by people around the world today and 
for decades to come.

Novartis continued to deliver trans-
formative innovation to patients in 
2021. We received 21 major approvals, 
including new treatments for high cho-
lesterol and chronic myeloid leukemia, 
and made 34 major submissions. We 
advanced our diverse pipeline of 
investigational therapies, with three 
breakthrough therapy designations 
from the US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) and around 20 clinical 
data readouts paving the way for 
further launches in 2022 and beyond.

Our R&D efforts span two units. The 
Novartis Institutes for BioMedical 
Research (NIBR) leads drug discovery 
and development from concept to 
early clinical evaluation, and also 
partners with an external network of 
around 300 academic collaborators 

and 100 industry collaborators 
focused on areas of mutual scientific 
interest. Global Drug Development 
(GDD) leads the advanced clinical 
development of potential new medi-
cines, running large clinical trials and 
steering the way to regulatory 
approval and access for patients.

These efforts have given Novartis  
one of the strongest discovery and 
development programs in the industry, 
with more than 275 research pro-
grams as well as 98 assets in devel-
opment, spanning around 50 diseases 
and 71 new molecular entities. We 
invested USD 9.5 billion in R&D  
in 2021, or approximately 18.5% of  
our net sales, compared with  
USD 9.0 billion in 2020. 

We prioritize projects with the poten-
tial to transform the standard of care 
for patients. Approximately 85% of 
our treatments in development have 
the potential to be first in class or first 
in a specific indication, while about 
80% target areas of high unmet 
patient need. 

We systematically integrate access 
into our discovery and development 
work. For example, we regularly 
review all drug development submis-
sions and hold our clinical research 
teams accountable for acting on 
access opportunities. We also engage 
patients in how we research and 
develop our medicines, and we strive 
to include diverse patient populations 
in our studies to ensure we under-
stand how patients everywhere might 
respond to a medicine. 

Data science and digital 
technology 

We use data and digital strategies 
across our R&D operations to open 
new paths to scientific discovery, 
improve patient outcomes and 
streamline the development process. 
Our investments in digital technology 
also helped to keep our clinical trials 
on track during the COVID-19 pan-
demic. For more information, please 
see the section “Go big on data and 
digital.”

Advancing a strong and 
diverse pipeline

We are advancing more than 160 
projects in full clinical development, 
with 54 ongoing Phase III programs.  
By 2026, we anticipate approval of 20 
pipeline assets with the potential to 
become blockbuster medicines with 
annual sales of more than USD 1 billion. 
Building on our success in small-mole-
cule therapies and biologics, we are 
also investing in advanced technolo-
gies that offer new treatment para-
digms for patients, such as radioligand 
therapies and gene therapies.

Cardiovascular, renal and 
metabolism

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the 
leading cause of death worldwide. It  
is one of several complex and often 
interrelated chronic disorders – along 
with renal and metabolic diseases – 
that together affect billions of people 
around the globe. Novartis is pioneer-
ing treatments that address the 
spectrum of these diseases. 

Entresto is approved in more than  
100 countries for the treatment of 
adult symptomatic heart failure with 
reduced ejection fraction, a condition 
in which the heart fails to pump blood 
as well as it should. In 2021, Entresto 
was granted an expanded indication 
in the US and other countries, allow-
ing for the treatment of most chronic 
heart failure patients, including all 
those with an ejection fraction below 
normal.

Also in 2021, Entresto received 
approval in China and Japan for 
treatment of patients with essential 
hypertension, the most common form 
of high blood pressure. This new 
indication makes Entresto the first 
new therapy for hypertension in  
China in over 10 years.

Leqvio is a novel treatment that 
reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol, a highly important modifi-
able risk factor for atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), 

which accounts for over 85% of all 
CVD deaths. Clinical studies showed 
that this first and only small-interfering 
RNA therapy for ASCVD can reduce 
LDL cholesterol by up to 52%, on top 
of maximally tolerated statins, through 
two injections per year, after an initial 
dose and one at three months. Leqvio 
has been approved in more than 50 
countries, including the US and the 
EU, as well as in the UK as part of  
a population health management 
agreement that is expected to reach 
up to 300 000 patients in three years.

TQJ230 (pelacarsen), another nucleic 
acid-based therapy, is currently in 
Phase III development for the second-
ary prevention of cardiovascular 
events in patients with elevated levels 
of lipoprotein(a), an independent 
inherited ASCVD risk factor that 
cannot be effectively addressed by 
diet and other lifestyle changes. 
Phase II trial data showed that 
TQJ230 can reduce lipoprotein(a) in 
high-risk patients below recognized 
risk thresholds.

LNP023 (iptacopan) is an investiga-
tional treatment for several severe, 
life-limiting kidney conditions, includ-
ing C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and IgA 
nephropathy (IgAN) – two diseases 
that mainly affect younger patients 
– as well as paroxysmal nocturnal 
hemoglobinuria, a life-threatening 
blood disorder. In 2021, we announced 
that LNP023 met its primary endpoints 
for C3G and its primary endpoint for 
IgAN in Phase II clinical trials. Phase III 
studies are ongoing.  

Oncology

Cancer, one of the world’s leading 
causes of death, inflicts a growing 
burden. Global cancer deaths are 
expected to nearly double by 2040 
due mainly to population growth  
and aging. 

Novartis is a leader in finding new 
treatments for cancer, with approxi-
mately 45 compounds in development 
across four therapeutic platforms: 
targeted treatments, radioligand 
therapies, cell therapies and immuno-
therapies.

Novartis is a leader in finding 
new treatments for cancer, 
with approximately 45 
compounds in development

Lung cancer
More people die of lung cancer than 
any other type of cancer, with death 
rates increasing in many parts of the 
world. 

ACZ885 (canakinumab) is an antibody 
treatment currently in Phase III 
development for non-small cell lung 
cancer. It was accelerated into lung 
cancer studies after results in a 
large-scale cardiovascular study 
demonstrated a significantly lower 
than expected lung cancer mortality. 
In 2021, we reported that two Phase 
III trials in non-small cell lung cancer 
for second- and first-line patients did 
not meet their primary endpoints. In 
the first-line study, however Novartis 
researchers observed potentially 
meaningful improvements among 
certain groups of patients. These 
results support continued study of 
ACZ885 in earlier stages of lung 
cancer and further evaluation of 
Pro-Tumor Inflammation in all lung 
cancer settings. Studies of ACZ885  
in both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant 
setting are ongoing.

In our mid-stage pipeline, we are 
exploring the potential of two com-
pounds discovered at NIBR – JDQ443 
and TNO155 – to target the previously 
“undruggable” proteins KRAS and 
SHP2, respectively. If proven effective, 
the combination therapy could open 
up new treatment options for patients 
with lung cancer as well as other 
hard-to-treat tumors.  

Our oncology pipeline also includes 
LXH254 (naporafenib), a targeted 
cancer therapy currently being 
studied in multiple combinations in 
defined populations of melanoma and 
lung cancer patients, and NIS793, for 
which the FDA has granted orphan 
drug designation for the treatment of 
pancreatic cancer in combination with 
chemotherapy.

Prostate cancer
Prostate cancer is the second most 
diagnosed cancer in people with a 
prostate gland, with poor survival 
prognosis in metastatic disease. 

Novartis is exploring a new, targeted 
way to treat metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) 
with 177Lu-PSMA-617 (lutetium Lu 177 
vipivotide tetraxetan/lutetium (177Lu) 
vipivotide tetraxetan), an investiga-
tional radioligand therapy. In 2021, the 
FDA granted 177Lu-PSMA-617 break-
through therapy designation after a 
Phase III study showed that the 
treatment plus existing care options 
significantly improved overall survival 
and radiographic progression-free 
survival for patients with mCRPC 
compared to existing care options 
alone. Regulatory submissions for 
177Lu-PSMA-617 have been accepted 
by the FDA and European Medicines 
Agency.

Breast cancer
Breast cancer, the most common 
cancer in women, is responsible for 
more than 685 000 deaths per year. 

We continue to see results from our 
clinical program for Kisqali. The 
results of a Phase III study announced 
in 2021 showed that Kisqali in combi-
nation with an aromatase inhibitor 
achieved an overall survival benefit of 
more than five years for postmeno-
pausal women with hormone receptor-
positive (HR+)/human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2-negative 
(HER2-) advanced breast cancer, 
which is the most common subtype of 
the disease. The data represent the 
longest reported median survival from 
a randomized trial in HR+/HER2- 
advanced breast cancer. Novartis is 
also conducting a Phase III study of 
Kisqali with endocrine therapy in the 
adjuvant treatment of HR+/HER2- 
early breast cancer. The trial com-
pleted enrollment in 2021.

Piqray is approved in the US and the 
EU for breast cancer patients whose 
disease harbors a PIK3CA mutation. 
Results from an ongoing Phase II 
study presented in 2021, as well as 
recent guideline updates, highlight the 
efficacy of Piqray with fulvestrant for 
postmenopausal HR+/HER2-, 

Two decades of pioneering innovation in  
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)

With a breakthrough approval 20 years ago, Novartis opened the 
door to reimagine CML and other cancers. Despite these advance-
ments, we’re not standing still.

In May 2001, Novartis received approval in the US for the first targeted therapy for 
cancer, known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This was a watershed moment in drug 
discovery, transforming the treatment landscape for CML and opening the door to 
treatment possibilities for other forms of cancer and blood disorders. Today the 
estimated five-year survival rate for CML is above 70%; in the 1970s, it was only 22%. 

Yet despite CML being transformed into a chronic disease for many patients, 
significant unmet needs still remain – particularly for patients who have experienced 
resistance or intolerance to available treatments. Our research continues, and in 
2021 we received US approval of a new treatment for CML in two distinct indications, 
offering a new treatment option for patients who are resistant or intolerant to existing 
therapies, and marking another milestone in our long-standing scientific commitment 
to patients living with CML.

overgrowth syndrome, a group of rare 
disorders that cause overgrowth of 
parts of the body.

In 2021, we reported that a Phase III 
clinical study of our chimeric antigen 
receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy 
Kymriah as a second-line treatment  
in aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma did not meet its primary 
endpoint. We continue to study 
Kymriah in other forms of lymphoma 
and leukemia.

Hematology
Scemblix, a new treatment for chronic 
myeloid leukemia (CML), was 
approved by the FDA in 2021 for use 
in patients who are resistant or 
intolerant to prior treatments, and also 
for patients with a specific mutation. 
Discovered by researchers at NIBR, 
the treatment highlights our ongoing 
commitment to patients with the 
disease (see “Two decades of pio-
neering innovation in chronic myeloid 
leukemia” on the previous page). 

MBG453 (sabatolimab) is an anti-
TIM-3 monoclonal antibody being 
studied for the treatment of higher-
risk myelodysplastic syndromes and 
acute myeloid leukemia, both rare 
blood cancers. In 2021, MBG453 
received a fast track designation from 
the FDA and an orphan drug designa-
tion from the European Commission.In 
2021, we reported that a Phase III 
clinical study of Kymriah as a second-
line treatment in aggressive B-cell 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma did not meet 
its primary endpoint. We continue to 
study Kymriah in other forms of 
lymphoma and leukemia.

Immunology, hepatology 
and dermatology

Our R&D teams are pioneering the 
development of therapies for immune 
system disorders, skin conditions and 
other diseases with high unmet needs. 

We are committed to developing 
medicines that will advance the 
treatment of chronic spontaneous 
urticaria (CSU), so patients are able to 
live their lives without the distressing 
and unpredictable symptoms of this 
skin disease. Any new therapies will 
add to our portfolio of medicines that 
already includes Xolair, our existing 
approved therapy for CSU.

Enrollment began in 2021 for Phase III 
studies in CSU of LOU064 (remibruti-
nib), an oral BTK inhibitor that we are 
investigating for a number of immune-
mediated conditions.

Also in 2021, Phase III clinical trials for 
QGE031 (ligelizumab), a next-genera-
tion monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin 
E (IgE) antibody, showed that QGE031 

demonstrated superiority compared 
with placebo in the treatment of CSU, 
but not versus Xolair. Novartis is 
continuing to evaluate the trial data. 
We also continue to evaluate the 
potential for QGE031 to bring benefit 
to patients in the areas of chronic 
inducible urticaria and food allergy, 
where there is significant unmet need.

Cosentyx, our treatment for several 
systemic inflammatory conditions, 
continues to show strength in 
addressing a variety of debilitating 
dermatological and rheumatological 
conditions. In 2021, we announced 
approvals of Cosentyx in the US and 
China for the treatment of moderate-
to-severe plaque psoriasis in pediatric 
patients aged 6 years and older who 
are candidates for systemic therapy 
or phototherapy, as well as in the US 
to treat active juvenile psoriatic 
arthritis (JPsA) in patients aged 2 
years and older, and active enthesitis-
related arthritis (ERA) in patients aged 
4 years and older. Cosentyx is the 
only biologic treatment approved for 
children and adolescents for both 
ERA and JPsA in the US. 

Cosentyx is also being studied for 
other inflammatory conditions, 
including hidradenitis suppurativa, 
giant cell arteritis and lichen planus, 
highlighting our commitment to 
expand Cosentyx to more indications 
and provide new treatment options for 
patients.

In 2021, we announced the discontin-
uation of a Phase IIb study of CFZ533 
(iscalimab) in kidney transplant 
patients. The study of CFZ533 in liver 
transplant continues, as do studies 
exploring CFZ533 as a potential 
treatment in other conditions, such as 
hidradenitis suppurativa and Sjögren’s 
syndrome.

Neuroscience

Neurological diseases are a leading 
cause of death and disability world-
wide. Our work in neurological disor-
ders includes investigational treat-
ments for multiple sclerosis (MS), 
spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and 
other diseases.

Our gene therapy Zolgensma is a 
treatment for both presymptomatic 
and symptomatic children with SMA,  
a devastating neurodevelopmental 
disease. It is approved in 42 countries. 
Building on our success with 
Zolgensma, in 2021 we started a new 
Phase III study of an intrathecal 
formulation in treatment-naive 
patients with SMA type 2. Early 
patient identification through newborn 
screening is critical for SMA patients 
since the disease causes irreplacea-
ble motor neuron loss. For more on 
how we work with payers and health-
care systems to highlight the impor-
tance of early screening for SMA 
patients, please see the section 
“Embrace operational excellence.”

Our comprehensive portfolio for MS 
– a debilitating chronic disease that 
affects 2.8 million people worldwide 
– emphasizes our commitment to 
improving the quality of life for people 
living with MS at all stages of the 
disease. Kesimpta, one of our thera-
pies for MS, received approval in the 
EU in 2021 for the treatment of 
relapsing forms of MS in adults with 
active disease. It is already approved 
in the US and other key markets. 
Kesimpta is the first B-cell therapy 
that can be self-administered at home. 
In 2021, we also started Phase III trials 
to investigate LOU064 in patients with 
relapsing forms of MS.

Our portfolio shows our 
commitment to impro ving 
the quality of life for people 
living with multiple sclerosis

We are exploring other neurological 
conditions where the need for new 
treatments is pressing. One example 
is Huntington’s disease, a rare, 
inherited neurodegenerative condition 
that leads to progressive disability 
and death. There currently are no 
approved therapies that delay onset 
of the disease or slow its progression. 
LMI070 (branaplam), our investiga-
tional, oral small-molecule RNA splicing 
modulator, could potentially treat 
Huntington’s disease by targeting RNA 
to reduce levels of a mutant protein. 
Phase II trials were initiated in 2021.

In 2021, Novartis and UCB announced 
a global co-development and co-com-
mercialization agreement to bring 
potentially disease-modifying thera-
pies to people living with Parkinson’s 
disease, which affects more than 10 
million people worldwide. These 
investigational therapies include 
UCB0599, a small-molecule, alpha-
synuclein misfolding inhibitor currently 
in Phase II development, which is being 
studied to understand if it can slow or 
stop the progression of Parkinson’s 
disease. In addition, upon completion 
of an ongoing Phase I program, there 
is an opt-in to co-develop UCB7853, 
an anti-alpha-synuclein antibody.

Ophthalmology 

We are working to find innovative 
treatments for diseases of the eye, 
with the goal of reducing or eliminat-
ing the huge burden on patients and 
society caused by visual impairment 
and blindness. 

One of our novel treatments is UNR844, 
a topical ophthalmic solution currently 
in Phase II development for presbyo-
pia – a common, gradual, age-related 
loss of the ability to focus actively on 
nearby objects, caused by loss of 
elasticity of the lens of the eye. 

In 2021, Novartis announced an 
agreement to acquire the UK-based 
ocular gene therapy company Gyro-
scope Therapeutics, adding to our 
pipeline a one-time gene therapy that 
could transform care for geographic 
atrophy (GA), an advanced form of dry 
age-related macular degeneration 
(AMD) that leads to progressive and 
irreversible vision loss. There are no 
approved treatments for GA, making it 
one of the most significant unmet 
needs remaining in retinal diseases. 

GT005, the lead asset from Gyro-
scope Therapeutics, is designed as 
an AAV2-based, one-time investiga-
tional gene therapy for GA secondary 
to AMD that is delivered under the 
retina. Completion of the acquisition is 
subject to customary closing condi-
tions. Novartis and Gyroscope Thera-
peutics will continue to operate as 
separate and independent companies 
until closing.

Respiratory and allergy

and accelerate the next generation of 
radioligand therapies for cancer.

Novartis is developing novel therapies 
to treat respiratory conditions such as 
asthma, chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease and fibrotic lung dis-
eases. These illnesses affect the lives 
of millions of people worldwide, and 
evidence suggests the burden is  
increasing due to climate change.

Building on our success with Xolair, the 
first biologic brought to market for 
asthma, we are pursuing Phase II 
studies for CSJ117, an inhaled biologic 
adjuvant therapy for severe uncon-
trolled asthma. We also initiated Phase 
III studies of QGE031 for patients with 
IgE-mediated peanut allergy.

Advanced technology 
platforms

Novartis is investing in new technolo-
gies and platforms that offer more 
targeted approaches to fighting – and, 
in some cases, potentially curing 
– serious diseases. We have the depth 
and scale to discover, develop and 
commercialize therapies using these 
advanced platforms.

Radioligand therapy delivers preci-
sion-targeted radiation to cancer cells 
widely disseminated in the body, with 
the goal of limiting damage to sur-
rounding tissue. It has the potential to 
address a wide range of cancers and 
become a major pillar of cancer care.

Novartis has built a strong foundation 
in this area with Lutathera, our first 
approved radioligand therapy, and 
with 177Lu-PSMA-617, our investiga-
tional therapy for prostate cancer 
(see “Oncology” above). In 2021, we 
acquired fibroblast associated protein 
(FAP) targeted assets from iThera-
nostics. We launched a collaboration 
with Artios to explore novel combina-
tions of radioligand therapy and DNA 
damage pathway inhibitors and with 
PeptiDream to work on macrocyclic 
and constrained peptides. We also 
established a partnership with Molec-
ular Partners to work on DARPin 
protein-based binding domains. We 
have more than 15 research and 
clinical programs underway to identify 

In gene therapy, one of our technolo-
gies uses benign viruses called 
adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to 
deliver genes to cells inside the body. 
The goal is to repair the cells with a 
one-time treatment. Our first 
approved AAV-based therapy was 
Zolgensma for SMA, and we are now 
exploring experimental forms of gene 
therapy for other diseases, from brain 
disease to blood disorders. Altogether 
we have more than 20 research 
programs in gene therapy. 

The Novartis early-stage pipeline 
features a growing arsenal of optoge-
netic gene therapies, based on 
genetically engineered light-sensitive 
proteins that can rewire cells in the 
eye, allowing them to act as replace-
ment photoreceptors. In 2020 and 
2021, we obtained two key optoge-
netic technologies through the 
acquisitions of Vedere Bio and Arctos 
Medical. The resulting therapies could 
potentially treat blinding diseases 
such as inherited retinal dystrophies 
and age-related macular degenera-
tion, which affect millions of patients 
worldwide.  

With cell therapy, a patient has key 
cell types extracted and genetically 
modified in a clinical lab before being 
injected back into the body. An 
example of this is CAR-T therapy, a 
treatment generated from a patient’s 
own T-cells. Novartis was the first 
pharmaceutical company to signifi-
cantly invest in pioneering CAR-T 
research and initiate global CAR-T 
trials. Our flagship CAR-T therapy, 
Kymriah, was the first cell therapy 
approved in the US for certain kinds 
of leukemia and lymphoma, and is 
now available to patients in 30 coun-
tries. We aim to broaden the impact of 
CAR-T technology to help patients 
with a variety of difficult-to-treat 
hematological cancers and solid 
tumors. 

Novartis has a resilient global CAR-T 
manufacturing footprint, spanning 
seven facilities across four continents. 
In 2021, we announced the develop-
ment of a novel manufacturing plat-

form – created at NIBR – called 
T-Charge, which is expected to 
improve the therapeutic potency of 
the T-cell product while halving the 
time needed to take cells from the 
patient, manufacture the product, and 
return it to a healthcare professional 
for administration.

Innovation for global 
health

Our R&D efforts include discovering 
and developing novel medicines for 
our company’s flagship global health 
priorities, as well as other diseases 
that predominantly affect underserved 
patients in lower-income countries, 
while exploring new ways to treat 
COVID-19, the most urgent public 
health issue in the world today. 

COVID-19

We are collaborating with Molecular 
Partners to develop ensovibep, a 
potential new treatment option for 
COVID-19 that targets the virus using 
proprietary DARPin technology to 
neutralize SARS-CoV-2.

The topline results of a Phase II study 
reported in early 2022 showed that a 
single intravenous dose of ensovibep 
reduced viral load through Day Eight, 
shortened symptom duration, reduced 
emergency room visits and/or hospi-
talizations related to COVID-19, and 
reduced deaths, compared to pla-
cebo. In separate studies, it main-
tained potent in-vitro pan-variant 
activity against all variants of concern 
identified so far, including Omicron. 
Novartis in-licensed ensovibep from 
Molecular Partners. We will accelerate 
manufacturing scale-up and plan to 
seek expedited regulatory authoriza-
tions globally.

Separately, we are working to dis-
cover a novel therapy targeting the 
main protease – an enzyme essential 
to viral replication across coronavi-
ruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The 
goal is to develop a therapy that could 
treat many or all other forms of 
coronaviruses, potentially addressing 
future pandemics.

OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2021

Malaria

Malaria continues to burden societies 
across the globe, particularly in Africa, 
and evidence suggests that cases 
may rise as a result of climate change. 
Novartis has taken a multipronged 
approach to fighting the disease, 
working with partners such as Medi-
cines for Malaria Venture to research, 
develop and manufacture a portfolio 
of essential antimalarial drugs. 

In 1999, we introduced our first 
malaria drug, a highly effective fixed 
dose of artemisinin-based combina-
tion therapy. In 2021, we crossed the  
1 billion mark in antimalarial treat-
ments delivered to patients worldwide 
(please see “Build trust with society” 
for more information).

For more than 20 years, the Novartis 
Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD), 
part of NIBR, has been at the fore-
front in the search for novel medicines 
for malaria and other neglected 
diseases. Two Novartis compounds 
for uncomplicated and severe malaria, 
KAF156 (ganaplacide) and KAE609 
(cipargamin), respectively, are in 
clinical trials in Africa and Asia. These 
compounds could potentially address 
resistance to current therapies as well 
as provide simplified therapeutic 
regimens. In 2021, a Phase IIb study of 
KAF156 and its partner medicine, 
lumefantrine, in adults and children 
with malaria reported positive results, 
supporting continued development of 
the combination treatment.

Neglected tropical diseases

NITD, with funding from the Wellcome 
Trust, is in the early stages of a 
discovery program aimed at finding 
first-in-class curative anti-parasitic 
therapies for Chagas disease, a 
serious condition affecting more  
than 6 million people mainly in Latin 
America. We are also conducting a 
Phase IV trial of our heart failure 
medicine Entresto in patients with 
chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. 
Chagas disease is a tropical parasitic 
infection but can manifest in the long 
term as chronic heart failure or other 
complications, causing disability and 
even death. 

With an estimated 50 000 to 90 000 
new cases per year, visceral leishmani-
asis is the most serious form of 
leishmaniasis, causing fever, weight 
loss, spleen and liver enlargement, and 
death if left untreated. In 2020, we 
announced a collaboration with the 
Drugs for Neglected Diseases initia-
tive (DNDi) to jointly develop LXE408, 
a first-in-class inhibitor of the kineto-
plastid proteasome, for the treatment 
of visceral leishmaniasis. Within the 
scope of the agreement, Novartis is 
responsible for Phase I studies, 
technical research and development 
activities, and regulatory interactions. 
Upon approval, we have committed to 
distributing the drug on an affordable 
basis worldwide to maximize access in 
endemic countries. DNDi will lead 
Phase II and III clinical development 
activities, with the first Phase II study 
scheduled to start in 2022 in India. 
Additional trials are planned in East 
Africa, which has the highest burden  
of visceral leishmaniasis.

Sickle cell disease

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a heredi-
tary blood condition that afflicts 
millions around the globe, particularly 
people of African descent, with 
sub-Saharan Africa bearing roughly 
80% of the disease burden. Our 
commitment to addressing SCD 
includes a therapeutic pipeline as well 
as a holistic approach to diagnose, 
treat and manage the disease in 
sub-Saharan Africa.

While the genetic cause of SCD has 
been known for decades, only 
recently has medical science gained 
the tools to potentially mitigate the 
biological effects of the errant gene 
that causes the disease. We also are 
pursuing an ex vivo hematopoietic 
stem cell program for SCD, using 
CRISPR gene editing technology 
licensed from Intellia Therapeutics, 
and in 2021 we initiated patient 
dosing. Also in 2021, Novartis 
announced a pioneering collaboration 
with the Bill & Melinda Gates Founda-
tion to support the discovery of a 
single-administration in vivo gene 
therapy to cure SCD, designed from 
the start to be practical for use in 
lower-resourced settings.

Putting patients at the 
center of our clinical 
trials
Engaging with patients and caregivers 
across the life cycle of our medicines 
is critically important to ensure we 
develop treatments that not only are 
safe and effective, but also truly 
address unmet medical needs.

The Novartis Commitment to Patients 
and Caregivers, launched in 2018, 
guides our teams across functions 
and divisions in ensuring patients have 
a voice in the research, development 
and commercialization of our medi-
cines. We continue to roll out a 
systematic approach to patient 
engagement that covers the full 
development life cycle – from early 
research to post-launch. 

We continue to roll out a 
systematic approach to 
patient engagement that 
covers the full development 
life cycle – from early 
research to post-launch

In 2021, 57, or around 30%, of our 
clinical development programs had a 
patient engagement component, up 
from 44 in 2020. Patients provided 
input on key aspects such as clinical 
study endpoints that matter to their 
disease, how to facilitate easier 
access to clinical trial sites, and how 
to enable remote trial participation. 
We also integrated patient insights 
into early-stage research: In 2021,  
46 NIBR programs had a patient 
engagement component.

Patient engagement also enables us 
to streamline our clinical trials and 
bring our medicines to market more 
quickly. For example, early input from 
patients in trial design can help us 
reduce the need for costly and 
time-consuming protocol changes 
later in the development process 
while ensuring that the trial design is 
aligned with study participants’ needs 

and preferences. In addition, we 
continue to help patients access 
medicines through our patient support 
and managed access programs. 
Please see the section “Build trust 
with society” for more details.

In 2021, we engaged with 162 patient 
organizations across 48 disease 
areas to inform our decision-making. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
need for patient support grew while 
the income of patient organizations 
dropped, primarily due to the cancel-
lation of educational events and 
fundraising activities. We provided 
funding to the community that was – 
among other purposes – used to 
strengthen digital communications 
tools and channels to help bridge 
these gaps.  In 2020, the latest year 
for which data is available, Novartis 
supported 1 248 patient organizations 
in 79 countries. Please see the 
Novartis corporate website for more 
information.

Diversity in clinical trials

We strive to include diverse patient 
populations in our clinical trials – both 
to understand how patients who are 
most likely to be treated for a disease 
will respond to a medicine, and 
because it is the right thing to do.

We are working to address barriers to 
clinical trial participation, such as 
identifying sites where patients with a 
particular disease or condition may be 
located, identifying healthcare provid-
ers that treat underserved or under-
represented populations, and colla-
borating with researchers to enroll 
diverse populations in clinical trials.

In 2021, we published a Commitment 
to Diversity in Clinical Trials. In the 
short term, we committed to evaluate 
diversity and inclusion principles for 
all our Phase III studies with US 
country participation. In the longer 
term, we aim to expand this to all our 
global trials while leveraging data 
science and digital technology to 
track diversity data across our drug 
development programs. 

In the US, health disparities affecting 
minority groups are endemic – an issue 
that was highlighted and exacerbated 
by the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared 
with non-Hispanic whites, the Black 
and African American community has 
a lower life expectancy, a higher 
mortality rate from cancer, a greater 
likelihood of diseases such as asthma, 
and significantly increased rates of 
maternal and infant mortality. Health 
inequity is also a particular challenge 
for the Black and African American 
community in medical schools and 
among physicians and clinical trial 
investigators; in all three groups, Black 
and African Americans are proportion-
ally underrepresented.

In 2021, Novartis and the Novartis US 
Foundation announced plans to invest 
approximately USD 13.7 million to 
establish three research centers at 
Morehouse School of Medicine in 
Georgia, including a clinical trial 
center of excellence that could be a 
model for possible expansion to other 
historically Black colleges, universities 
and medical schools. 

The investment is part of a 10-year 
commitment with Morehouse; 26 
historically Black colleges, universities 
and medical schools; and other 
organizations. The objective is to 
co-create programs that address the 
root causes of systemic disparities in 
health outcomes and foster greater 
diversity, equity and inclusion across 
the R&D ecosystem.

In addition, we are collaborating with 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to support 
research investigating the link 
between genetic diversity across 
different regions in Africa and its 
potential impact on response to drug 
therapeutics. With a combined 
funding commitment of GBP 2.8 
million (USD 3.6 million) over five 
years, the project calls on African 
researchers to submit research 
proposals on the relevance of African 
genetic diversity to the treatment of 
malaria and tuberculosis. Proposals 
selected for funding are expected to 
be announced in the first half of 2022.

Strengthening product 
launches  

In our commercial operations, we aim 
to consistently deliver successful 
launches to support our financial 
performance and enable broad and 
rapid access to our medicines. 

In 2021, launch brands and medicines 
we consider our key growth drivers1 
contributed 52% of net sales in our 
Innovative Medicines Division, com-
pared with 44% in 2020. By 2026,  
we expect approval of more than 20 
pipeline assets with the potential to 
become blockbuster medicines with 
sales of more than USD 1 billion.

By 2026, we expect 
approval of more than 20 
pipeline assets with the 
potential to become 
blockbuster medicines

We have developed a launch roadmap 
to codify best practices. For example, 
we start to prepare early – more than 
three years before the anticipated 
launch date in many cases – including 
talking with patients, physicians and 
payers to better understand their 
perspectives and needs. In our 
Novartis Pharmaceuticals business 
unit, for example, around 80% of 
investment in medical affairs is now 
focused on the pre-launch stage.

For Kesimpta, our treatment for 
multiple sclerosis (MS), we focused 
pre-launch investment on three key 
markets: the US, Germany and China. 
We deployed an unbranded digital 
information platform that reached up 
to 2 000 physicians in the US. We 
also worked with patient advocacy 
groups to ensure their views were 
integrated into our launch prepara-
tions, and we talked to payers to 
understand their needs.

The preparations paid off: In the six 
months after launch in the US, we had 
reached 85% of our target customer 
base, most of them virtually, while 
around 20% of patients received 
Kesimpta as their first-ever treatment 
for MS and more than 50% of patients 
received it as their first-line treatment. 
Kesimpta is approved in more than 60 
countries worldwide.

Another example is Zolgensma, our 
gene therapy for spinal muscular 
atrophy (SMA) that reached USD 1.4 
billion in sales in 2021. Early patient 
identification through newborn screen-
ing programs and treatment aware-
ness are critical for SMA patients. We 
work closely with stakeholders such as 
payers to highlight the importance of 
early treatment, and provide disease 
awareness programs for parents, 
physicians and other health profes-
sionals to spot the signs and symp-
toms of SMA. In 2021, around 85%  
of new births in the US underwent 
screening for SMA, and we anticipate 
that the EU will have SMA screening in 
place for all new births by 2025. 

Our pre-launch preparations also 
found that achieving sustainable 
access to a one-time gene therapy 
like Zolgensma in diverse markets 
such as Argentina and Egypt requires 
a menu of options to address the 
needs of stakeholders. For example, 
our early access and “Day One” 
access agreements offer customiza-
ble options for payers – including 
retroactive rebates, deferred pay-
ments, installment options and 
outcome-based rebates – and are 
designed to ensure that access is 
available to patients even before 
regulatory approval and formal 
national reimbursement agreements 
are in place. In 2021, we had early 
access agreements in place in six 
markets, and pay-for-performance 
agreements in place in 16 markets. 
The therapy was commercially 
available in over 40 countries. 

1 Launch brands include Zolgensma, Kesimpta, Mayzent, Beovu, Luxturna, Leqvio, Enerzair, Atectura, Piqray, Adakveo, 
Tabrecta and Scemblix. Growth drivers include Cosentyx, Entresto, Xolair, Ilaris, Xiidra, Aimovig, Promacta/Revolade, 
Taﬁnlar + Mekinist, Kisqali, Lutathera, Kymriah and Jakavi (marketed by Novartis outside the US). 

Meanwhile, in our Oncology business 
unit we leveraged more than 20 years 
of experience in chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML) to launch Scemblix,  
a new treatment option for patients 
that was approved in the US in 2021 
for treatment of CML in two distinct 
indications. 

Despite tremendous advances in CML 
treatment over the past decades, 
some patients struggle to meet 
treatment goals due to intolerance or 
inadequate response. Before launch, 
we took steps to raise awareness of 
remaining unmet needs for CML 
patients. Additionally, at the time of 
launch we estimate that more than 
80% of US healthcare providers who 
treat CML were aware of the com-
pound and/or its unique mechanism 
of action – known in scientific litera-
ture as a STAMP inhibitor. We antici-
pate approval in Japan and Europe 
during 2022.

We are also preparing for other 
launches in our oncology pipeline.  
 For example, we plan to enter the 
growing checkpoint inhibitor field with 
VDT482 (tislelizumab), an anti-PD-1 
monoclonal antibody that we in-
licensed in 2021 as part of an agree-
ment with  an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd. 
We anticipate launch of VDT482 in 
second-line esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma – the most common 
type of esophageal cancer globally 
– in the US in mid-2022. Looking 
further ahead, the need to extend 
survival for more patients with differ-
ent tumor types still exists. We believe 
VDT482 has the potential for syner-
gistic combinations with other 
Novartis medicines to help address 
these unmet needs, and we have 
initiated three combinations in clinical 
trials and aim to advance several more 
within the next years.

Transforming 
manufacturing

The Novartis Technical Operations 
(NTO) organization, which manufac-
tures innovative medicines and 
Sandoz products, helps us to optimize 
resource allocation while ensuring 
quality across our 53 production sites 
worldwide. NTO is split into different 
technology platforms with responsibil-
ity for large molecules, small mole-
cules, Sandoz products, cell and gene 
therapies, and ophthalmology and 
local market production. 

In 2021, we continued to ensure a 
reliable supply of medicines to patients 
worldwide. Our NTO employees 
supplied 71 billion treatments in 2021, 
broadly in line with the previous two 
years, while also supplying tens of 
millions of vaccine doses for COVID-19.

Supporting demand for COVID-19 vaccines

Novartis is helping produce COVID-19 vaccines at our facilities in 
Switzerland and Austria as part of our efforts to help end the pan-
demic and support the stability of global health systems.

Although Novartis no longer has a vaccines business, our many biologics products 
give us the capabilities to perform mRNA manufacturing and the final step of 
aseptically filling the vaccine into vials. We prepared our facilities to do this task in 
only a few months – a process that usually takes more than a year. We produced 40 
million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in 2021. 

We also signed an agreement with Roche for the production at our Singapore site of 
the active pharmaceutical ingredient for Roche’s Actemra®/RoActemra®, a treatment 
for rheumatoid arthritis that received emergency use authorization by the US FDA for 
the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults and children.

OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2021

Our manufacturing operations also 
continue to evolve as we invest in new 
technologies and respond to the 
changing business environment. In 
2021, we started manufacturing our 
cholesterol-lowering drug Leqvio at 
our Schaftenau drug production site 
in Austria. Leqvio is a small-interfering 
RNA (siRNA) therapy that is approved 
in more than 50 countries. We are 
also installing our first siRNA oligonu-
cleotide manufacturing facility at our 
Schweizerhalle site in Switzerland, 
which will produce the active ingredi-
ent of Leqvio.

In 2021, our production sites responded 
to sharply increased demand for some 
Novartis products in China after their 
inclusion on the country’s National 
Reimbursement Drug List made them 
available to more patients. For exam-
ple, we responded to a significant 
increase in demand for Cosentyx and 
Taﬁnlar versus the previous year.

We are also pursuing a digital trans-
formation of our manufacturing 
operations with the aim of improved 
quality and greater efficiency. For 
more details on how we are using 
digital technology and data analytics 
across the company, please see the 
section “Go big on data and digital.”

We continue to optimize our network 
of manufacturing sites worldwide, 
adjusting our production capacity to 
match our changing product mix. In 
2021, we announced plans to trans-
form 11 sites, including three that we 
plan to sell or close and one that we 
already sold. We are working with 
employees affected by the changes  
to help them manage through the 
transition.

Novartis sites are on track 
to eliminate polyvinyl 
chloride in secondary and 
tertiary packaging by the 
end of 2022

In addition, Novartis sites are on track 
to eliminate polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in 
secondary and tertiary packaging by 
the end of 2022. For example, we now 
use a carton-based packaging design 
for Aimovig, a migraine treatment.

For more on this topic, please see the 
section “Build trust with society” and 
our TCFD disclosure.

Ensuring patient health 
and safety 

Patient safety is fundamental to our 
purpose: We cannot improve and 
extend people’s lives if we do not 
deliver safe, high-quality medicines. 
The importance of patient safety was 
highlighted in our 2021 materiality 
assessment, with both internal and 
external stakeholders identifying it as 
the most material topic.

Patient safety cuts across several 
strategic priorities for Novartis, 
including operational excellence and 
building trust with society. Our 
activities are focused on three areas 
that span the life cycle of our medi-
cines and cover both our own opera-
tions and activities outside our walls: 
product quality, pharmacovigilance 
and combating falsified medicines.

Sustainability in 
manufacturing
Our manufacturing facilities are 
central to our efforts to minimize our 
environmental footprint. The majority 
of Novartis carbon emissions, water 
usage and waste in our own opera-
tions come from our production sites. 
In 2021, efforts to reduce the environ-
mental footprint of our manufacturing 
sites contributed more than 10% of 
our overall reduction in carbon 
emissions (Scope 1 and 2) and more 
than 7% reduction in water consump-
tion, as well as more than 34% of 
waste reduction in our own operations. 

We are investing in new technologies 
to make our manufacturing processes 
more resource efficient. For example, 
an upgrade to the solvent process at 
our Kundl site in Austria led to a reduc-
tion of 8 500 tons of carbon dioxide 
(CO2) annually. Our site in Huningue, 
France, reduced 19% of its annual 
energy consumption – equivalent to  
1 600 tons of CO2 – through a more 
energy-efficient system. A site in 
Turkey used a filtration system to cut 
water consumption by 14%.

All manufacturing sites are required  
to treat process water according to 
local legal requirements before it is 
returned to the environment. Novartis 
facilities and priority suppliers are 
included in our PiE (Pharmaceuticals  
in the Environment) program to assess 
their effluent load of active pharma-
ceutical ingredients (APIs) in water 
streams against internal standards and 
requirements from the AMR Industry 
Alliance framework – a private sector 
coalition providing sustainable solu-
tions to curb antimicrobial resistance. 
Potential impacts on water quality from 
the use of our products downstream in 
the value chain are considered part of 
the marketing authorization approval 
process.   

99.2%

Regulatory inspections
of our facilities worldwide found 
to be acceptable 

Product quality

We maintain a robust quality manage-
ment system for the production of 
marketed products and investigational 
medicines, in full compliance with 
requirements from health authorities 
and other regulators around the world. 

We hold relevant manufacturing 
licenses and Good Manufacturing 
Practice (GMP) certificates for 100% 
of our manufacturing, supply and 
distribution operations. These are 
issued after inspections by external 
health authorities such as the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA), the World Health Organization 
(WHO) and Swissmedic. We hold 
relevant ISO certifications for the 
manufacture of medical devices.

Of 126 inspections of our facilities by 
health authorities around the world in 
2021, all but one (99.2%) were found 
to be acceptable without major 
findings. For the one inspection that 
required further improvement, a 
corrective action plan was deemed 
acceptable by the relevant health 
authority (EMA). Of the 126 inspec-
tions, 31 were performed remotely, 
and one FDA inspection relied on a 
prior inspection conducted by the 
Austrian healthcare authorities under  
a mutual recognition agreement.

We also have a strong auditing 
program covering both our own 
operations and those of our suppliers. 
Despite COVID-19-related challenges 
such as travel restrictions, we con-
ducted 1 419 audits in 2021, including 
1 294 audits of suppliers, with 690

audits conducted remotely. All but six 
audits were found to be acceptable 
(99.1%). One of the audits that required 
further improvement was at our own 
site due to unretrievable source data 
from a legacy system that is set to be 
decommissioned and replaced by the 
end of 2021. The other audits with 
opportunities for improvement were at 
external suppliers with corrective 
actions in progress.

We conduct thorough investigations 
when any deviations from current 
GMPs or other relevant regulations 
occur, or when we detect out-of-speci-
fication results or any other failures in 
our manufacturing processes. Inci-
dents are assessed by subject matter 
experts and conclusions are provided 
to the appropriate health authorities 
with relevant documentation. Actions 
such as recalls are executed in agree-
ment with the relevant authorities. 
Novartis initiated 27 recalls in 2021. 

We also monitor our medicines for the 
possible presence of nitrosamines 
and completed all necessary nitrosa-
mine assessments in 2021, closely 
following the recently agreed EMA/
FDA implementation plan for the 
pharmaceutical industry. 

We have a robust quality and safety 
training process for employees and 
third parties. We require all employees 
involved in manufacturing, supply and 
distribution to undergo at least two 
annual training sessions on quality 
standards. Employees can take 
additional training relevant to their 
role or worksite. We are regularly 
audited on our training procedures.

the ongoing disruptions created by 
the COVID-19 pandemic, we main-
tained our quality and safety training 
process in 2021. 

We look for ways to strengthen and 
streamline our quality processes to 
improve efficiency and bring our 
medicines to patients faster. This 
includes the use of digital technology 
and remote work across our quality 
operations, a trend that has been 
accelerated by the COVID-19 pan-
demic. For example, in 2021 we rolled 
out paperless quality control at three 
sites, including in Torre Annunziata, 
Italy, and in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

For more on this topic, please see the 
Novartis quality management system 
section of our corporate website.

Pharmacovigilance

Novartis continues its efforts to boost 
pharmacovigilance capabilities to 
support patient safety worldwide. 

While clinical trials provide important 
information on a medicine’s safety 
during development, it is only after its 
use in greater numbers of patients in 
real-world settings that some adverse 
events become known. Effective 
pharmacovigilance requires activities 
to educate patients, providers and 
pharmacists, and strengthen reporting 
of adverse events to the company. 
Our pharmacovigilance and falsified 
medicines teams also work closely 
together, for example in cases where 
a disproportionate number of adverse 
events may indicate the presence of 
suspected falsified medicines. 

All third parties providing services or 
products manufactured to good 
practice standards are required to 
have their own quality assurance 
department and a formal training 
process. Novartis routinely assesses 
the capability and effectiveness of 
third-party training programs during 
audits to confirm suitability for the 
provided service or product. Despite 

We maintain a high level of compli-
ance to regulatory requirements for 
both individual case safety reports 
and periodic benefit-risk assess-
ments. In addition, in 2021 an internal 
audit confirmed the strength of the 
Novartis integrated pharmacovigi-
lance governance model after it 
obtained ISO 9001 certification in the 
previous year.

With a growing number of medical 
devices in the Novartis portfolio, we 
have also built a robust system to 
monitor adverse events associated with 
medical devices worldwide. Novartis 
was the first company certified for 
compliance with the European Medical 
Devices Regulation, which came into 
force in 2021.

As a complement to traditional 
pharmacovigilance methods, we 
increasingly use technologies such as 
process automation, machine learning 
and natural language processing to 
analyze multiple data sources for 
adverse events. 

Novartis collaborates with pharma-
covigilance associations and authori-
ties in multiple countries, including 
Italy, the Scandinavian countries, 
Switzerland, China and India, to 
support the implementation of local 
and international guidelines as well as 
the implementation of new adverse 
event reporting submission methods. 

Further examples of our capacity-
building initiatives in 2021 included 
training for clinical trial investigators in 
Mexico and China, as well as support 
for the creation of a local organization 
for pharmacovigilance professionals 
in the Philippines. In Asia, Novartis 
participated in regional forums where 
we presented our pharmacovigilance 
approach for advanced technology 
platforms, such as cell and gene 
therapies, while in Latin America we 
worked with partners to support them 
in reporting adverse events under 
different scenarios of the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

Examples of our capacity-
building initiatives in 2021 
included training for clinical 
trial investigators in Mexico 
and China

In response to the COVID-19 pan-
demic, we set up a task force to 
ensure the continuity of our pharma-
covigilance system while providing 
support to healthcare professionals. 
We applied a pragmatic approach that 
created efficiencies across some of 
our processes such as the Individual 
Case Safety Report (ICSR) follow-up. 
We estimate that the ICSR efficiency 
gain translated into 2 500 saved 
hours for healthcare professionals at 
a critical time. 

Worldwide patient safety offices 
contri buted with safety data collection 
on COVID-19 investigator-initiated 
trials to support assessments about 
the impact of the new virus.

Falsified medicines

Falsified medicines are a growing 
global problem. The Pharmaceutical 
Security Institute reported a 38% 
increase in incidents of falsified 
medicines from 2016 to 2020, a  
trend that has been exacerbated  
by increased demand for medicines 
amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 

At Novartis, our priority is to protect 
patient health and safety through 
quick authentication and reporting of 
falsified medicines to health authori-
ties and the WHO. Since 2017, our 
efforts have helped prevent falsified 
medicines from reaching and harming 
more than 1.6 million patients.

In 2021, close collaboration with local 
law enforcement led to the investiga-
tion of 318 incidents in 41 countries, 
66 successful enforcement actions, 
and the seizure of 1 million units of 
falsified medicines as well as the 
removal of more than 10 100 illicit 
advertisements from online platforms. 

Digital technology is a critical part of 
our efforts to quickly authenticate 
falsified medicines. In 2021, we made 
significant progress on three intercon-
nected digital solutions.

Authentiﬁeld by Novartis is a cost-
effective mobile spectrometric sensor 
that can reduce the time needed to 
authenticate suspect medicines from 
several weeks to a maximum of five 
days. By early 2023, we aim to train  
1 000 end users and deploy 500 
sensors in 96 countries across 100 
high-risk products in our portfolio.

Another project is MoVe, a mobile 
platform that enables Novartis 
employees to quickly verify the 
authenticity of secondary packaging 
for any product. The solution was in 
use in 24 countries by the end of 2021.  

Finally, Novartis continued to lead an 
initiative with the Innovative Medicines 
Initiative and 12 major pharmaceutical 
companies to develop a use case for 
blockchain technology in the pharma-
ceutical supply chain. The aim is to 
empower patients to check their own 
medicines for authenticity while 
generating data – backed by robust 
privacy controls – on trends in falsi-
fied medicines.  

Fast authentication needs to be 
supported by timely reporting. 
Novartis has a policy to report all 
confirmed incidents of falsified 
medicines to the WHO within 10 days. 
Our efforts have been recognized as  
a best practice by the Access to 
Medicine Foundation. In 2021, 
Novartis was among the first pharma-
ceutical companies to join the WHO’s 
new online reporting platform for 
falsified medicines incidents. 

We also engage with public and 
private stakeholders, such as the 
WHO and the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment, to encourage coordinated 
action and promote effective policy-
making on falsified medicines. In 2021, 
we delivered over 150 engagements 
and reached over 7 200 stakeholders 
in 14 countries.

OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2021

12 064

Suppliers assessed
through our Third-Party Risk 
Management framework

Managing our supply 
chain responsibly

We are committed to working with 
third parties who operate in a manner 
that is consistent with our values and 
ethical principles. While interactions 
with third parties at Novartis are 
broadly defined by our Third-Party 
Code, we identify, assess, monitor and 
mitigate risk associated with suppliers 
through our Third-Party Risk Manage-
ment (TPRM) framework. 

Implemented globally across Novartis 
in 2019, our TPRM process promotes 
ethical behavior and fosters sustaina-
bility across our supply chain by 
addressing risk areas such as anti-
bribery; animal welfare; health, safety 
and environment (HSE); labor rights; 
information security; and data privacy. 
We conduct risk assessments for all 
new eligible suppliers and new 
products, services or sites from 
existing suppliers. Not all suppliers 
trigger a detailed risk assessment.  

In 2021, we assessed 12 064 suppli-
ers through our TPRM process, up 
from 8 448 in 2020. We agreed on 
remediation actions with 912 suppli-
ers, and we stopped engagements 

with 37 suppliers due to the risk 
assessment results. We audited 85 
suppliers, a significant increase from 
the previous year as the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic eased in several 
countries.

We took steps to increase 
the efficiency of our TPRM 
process and align it more 
closely to our overall view of 
risk at Novartis

In 2021, we took steps to increase the 
efficiency of our TPRM process and 
align it more closely to our overall 
view of risk at Novartis, while main-
taining a high level of assurance. 

For example, we started to prioritize 
all third parties in scope by risk 
severity. As part of this process, we 
de-scoped two risk areas – financial 
due diligence and business continuity 
– since the former is already embed-
ded in other process steps while the 
latter is covered by default within 
other risk areas.

section “Build trust with society.”) In 
addition, we moved responsibility for 
screening new vendors for Good 
Manufacturing Practice under the 
scope of Quality teams in NTO, which 
have specialized expertise in this area. 

We also evaluated ways to automate 
our processes. For example, current 
manual risk assessments for distribu-
tors and wholesalers will be gradually 
incorporated into an automated TPRM 
process, ensuring a standardized and 
auditable practice around the world.

Sustainability in our  
supply chain 

To reach our emissions reduction 
targets, we are working with our 
suppliers to help them apply, where 
possible, the same high standards of 
environmental sustainability as we do. 
By 2025, we aim to include environ-
mental sustainability criteria as part  
of all supplier contracts. 

We are working with key 
suppliers to set baselines 
and targets for CO2 
emissions, water 
consumption and waste 
management

In our manufacturing operations, we 
are working with key suppliers to set 
baselines and targets for CO2 emis-
sions, water consumption and waste 
management, as well as confirm the 
API content of manufacturing effluents. 
We are jointly developing sustainability 
roadmaps by focusing on product-spe-
cific technology action plans. Suppliers 
are also expected to report annually 
on progress and implement remedia-
tion plans where needed.  

We are also engaging our commercial 
suppliers, with a focus on those with 
the largest contribution to our carbon 

footprint. In 2021, we published the 
Novartis Green Expectations from 
Suppliers engagement framework. 
Our top 100 suppliers are expected to 
commit to emissions reduction targets 
approved by the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi) and regularly 
report on their environmental impact 
management and achievements 
through CDP. Meanwhile, we organ-
ized a Green Supplier Summit to 
discuss environmental sustainability 
challenges and potential solutions 
with our commercial suppliers.

Over the next several years, 
CTS is expected to continue 
to improve productivity to 
drive profitable growth

CTS has around 12 000 em ployees 
located in over 40 countries and 
across five global service centers, 
with offerings spanning technology, 
facilities, finance, human resources, 
procurement, consulting, data science 
and artificial intelligence (AI). 

Also in 2021, we worked with Schneider 
Electric and nine major pharmaceuti-
cal companies through an initiative 
called Energize to accelerate the 
adoption of renewable electricity in our 
shared supply chains in the US and 
Europe. We also provide guidance and 
tools to our manufacturing suppliers on 
water quality topics, including a tailored 
mass balance calculator to identify and 
quantify APIs in wastewater. 

Key focus areas include upgrading 
and simplifying our global enterprise 
resource planning systems. This 
multiyear project, which started in 
2020, will help Novartis leverage 
digital technology at an even greater 
scale. The goal is to significantly 
simplify our core processes, capabili-
ties and systems to provide greater 
flexibility and support to our business 
operations.

CTS teams are also helping to simplify 
the employee experience at Novartis. 
For example, we have introduced an 
AI-based virtual assistant to support 
employees with technology- and 
human resource-related queries. The 
tool will be expanded in the coming 
years to include all other functions.

We are also accelerating the use of 
technologies such as cognitive robotic 
process automation to improve 
productivity, enhance remote assis-
tance, and enable employees to focus 
their time on high-impact tasks. For 
example, more than 1 million transac-
tions that account for 75 000 hours of 
manual, repetitive work in functions 
such as human resources, finance 
and drug development are now done 
in a fraction of the time through 
AI-enabled automation.

For more on this topic, please see the 
section “Build trust with society” and 
our TCFD disclosure.

Delivering effective 
business services

Since 2018, we have transformed 
business services at Novartis to better 
enable our people to execute on our 
strategy and deliver on our purpose. 
Through these efforts, we have 
improved productivity and user satis-
faction while reducing our cost base 
and expanding our service offerings.

In 2021, we made further progress  
by creating a new organization called 
Customer & Technology Solutions 
(CTS), which combines the global 
scale of our business services func-
tions with the transformative nature  
of our enterprise digital teams. The 
aim is to deliver services and solutions 
that drive value across Novartis and 
enable the transformation of our 
enterprise. Over the next several 
years, CTS is expected to continue  
to improve productivity to drive 
profitable growth.

Accelerating innovation
Novartis aspires to be an industry 
leader in applying data science and 
digital technologies to the challenge 
of discovering new medicines. By 
enhancing assets in our pipeline 
through data and digital, we aim to 
improve patient outcomes, streamline 
the development process, and sup-
port diverse, inclusive trials. 

One example is the use of digital 
devices, such as wearable sensors, to 
capture continuous data on physical 
activity, sleep quality or fatigue, which 
could be used as endpoints in trials for 
diseases including chronic obstruc tive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) and 
Sjögren’s syndrome. Such “digital 
endpoints” can improve the relevance 
and objectivity of clinical trial data, as 
well as offer new insights. In our 
chimeric antigen receptor T-cell 
(CAR-T) programs, for example, we 
are using a wearable digital sensor as 
an exploratory endpoint to pilot the 
early detection of serious side effects 
like cytokine release syndrome in 
outpatient settings. In 2021, digital 
endpoints were used in 16 Novartis 
trials, with plans to add more in the 
coming years.

Digital technology can also make 
clinical trials more convenient for 
patients and caregivers by reducing 
the need for repeated in-person clinic 
visits. For example, in a Phase III study 
of our gene therapy Zolgensma in older 
children with spinal muscular atrophy, 
parents can upload videos of their 
child’s progress remotely from home. 

Leveraging our data

We are taking advantage of a key 
resource – vast amounts of data that 
once existed in silos at Novartis – to 
improve productivity and spur innova-
tion. In 2021, Novartis received a 
healthcare “Eye on Innovation” award 
from Gartner for our success in 
bringing this data together on a 

foundational, enterprise-wide data 
and analytics platform that includes 
more than 100 solutions and covers 
the life cycle of our business.

One example is data42, which makes 
data from more than 2 700 clinical 
trials over two decades, as well as 
data from real-world settings, availa-
ble to data scientists and researchers 
across Novartis. This advanced 
analytics platform makes it possible  
to discover connections in our data, 
identify relevant patient populations, 
and test hypotheses on a previously 
unimaginable scale – all with the aim 
of finding more treatments and 
getting them to patients faster. 

Data42 makes it possible to 
discover connections in our 
data, identify relevant patient 
populations, and test 
hypotheses on a previously 
unimaginable scale

Patient data in data42 is anonymized 
and protected by a robust clinical data 
access policy, and users are granted 
access only after receiving training. 
We are currently expanding data42 by 
adding more preclinical data. 

In 2021, data42 was used by more 
than 900 employees working on 
around 300 projects. These include 
efforts to better understand disease 
progression, optimize treatments and 
improve clinical trial design. For 
example, for an analysis in COPD, 
researchers can include data from 
patients in a heart failure trial who 
have COPD in their medical history or 
as an adverse event. For the first time, 
data scientists and researchers can 
also view the gender balance across 
all Novartis trials, sorted by disease 
area, indication and country. These 
insights help us design future trials 
with more emphasis on diversity and 
inclusion. 

Resilient clinical trials

Our investments in technology also 
helped keep our clinical trials on track 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. For 
example, more than 3 000 partici-
pants across nine clinical trials were 
referred through an online enrollment 
portal, after more than 15 000 poten-
tial participants completed an online 
trial qualification questionnaire. In  
one Phase II trial, digital recruitment 
contributed over 25% of the cohort  
of randomized patients.

We used another digital tool to 
forecast COVID-19 case progression 
and anticipate disruptions to clinical 
trials. In one trial, for instance, we 
identified potential delays of up to 
several months in patient enrollment 
and first visits related to specific 
locations. By redirecting resources to 
compensate, we reduced this gap to a 
few weeks. In other trials, we switched 
to remote solutions such as home 
nursing and home delivery of the 
investigational medicine.  

Streamlining R&D

The Novartis AI Innovation Center (AI 
Lab), a collaboration with Microsoft, 
continues to scale a range of solutions 
to improve productivity in early 
research through to product launch. 
For example, the AI Lab developed a 
platform that assists medicinal chem-
ists in optimizing molecular structures 
of promising molecules, enabling faster 
compound design and selection. 

Also in partnership with Microsoft, we 
rolled out a new AI platform to help 
simplify and streamline some of our 
processes. In 2021, it was used by 
employees responsible for formulation 
development and early manufacturing 
of investigational medicines. The 
platform is improving efficiency by 
connecting data sets and leveraging 
information from thousands of past 
formulations, and is expected to yield 
cost savings of several million dollars 
per year. We plan to expand the 
platform to other areas in our R&D 
operations. 

Novartis saved over USD 14 million 
from 2018 to 2021 by deploying 
BenchSci, an AI platform that derives 
actionable knowledge from scientific 
publications. Scientists at the Novartis 
Institutes for BioMedical Research 
(NIBR) use BenchSci to select the 
best antibody and other key reagents 
for their work, avoiding costly and 
unproductive experimental dead ends. 
BenchSci has helped accelerate 
projects by months, while also deliver-
ing novel scientific insights. 

BenchSci has helped 
accelerate projects by 
months, while also delivering 
novel scientific insights

We also work with academic organiza-
tions in areas of mutual scientific 
interest. For example, a collaboration 
with the Oxford Big Data Institute 
uses AI to generate insights from a 
multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical data 
set containing brain MRI scans and 
other data from approximately 35 000 
patients. The data set includes up to 
15 years of follow-up for some 
patients. The project has already 
yielded peer-reviewed publications 
and will generate further insights on 
long-term disease progression and 
prognosis of MS patients. 

Engaging customers 

We continue to invest in digital tools to 
provide personalization and better 
experiences for customers. These 
include AI-powered digital assistants 
to optimize the content, timing and 
method of communications with 
physicians based on their preferences. 
For example, a tool used by our 
Medical Affairs function provides data 
insights to 685 field-based medical 
science liaisons in 28 countries, 
helping to personalize their engage-
ments with healthcare professionals.

Such tools are part of a broader 
initiative to tailor information to the 

needs of healthcare professionals. 
This enterprise-wide, multiyear effort 
uses data insights to provide relevant 
information to physicians at the right 
time, through preferred channels, and 
at a frequency that best meets their 
needs – helping to improve the quality 
of our commercial and medical affairs 
interactions. 

In the US, commercial teams working 
on Cosentyx, Promacta and our 
portfolio of breast cancer medicines 
are using predictive analytics and 
machine learning to determine the 
most effective mix of face-to-face and 
digital communications to healthcare 
professionals – a personalized 
approach that has led to increased 
customer engagement. We aim to 
scale it to additional countries, 
including Germany and China. 

Digital health solutions

We are expanding patient-focused 
digital health solutions in key markets. 
This includes the cardiovascular 
disease app AI Nurse in China, which 
was developed in collaboration with 
Tencent. For more information, please 
see “Improving heart health in China” 
on the following page.

Another patient-focused solution is 
our clinically validated, AI-powered 
symptom checker for difficult-to-diag-
nose conditions such as psoriatic 
arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis, a 
chronic inflammatory disease that can 
take up to five years to diagnose. 
Patients enter their symptoms through 
a website that provides a detailed 
report that can be shared with their 
doctor. The site also gives links to 
disease information, details about 
local specialists and, in some cases, a 
telemedicine consultation. At the end 
of 2021, users had completed more 
than 53 000 assessments. Over 12 
100 had symptoms consistent with 
psoriatic arthritis or axial spondyloar-
thritis, and approximately 2 300 took 
follow-up actions. The tool was 
developed with Ada Health, and the

scope of the partnership has been 
expanded to include psoriasis, familial 
Mediterranean fever and Still’s 
disease across 13 markets.

We are also scaling projects through 
the Novartis Biome, a global network 
of innovation hubs that works with 
external partners on digital solutions 
across all aspects of our strategy. 
OdySight, for example, is a smart-
phone game that encourages patients 
with chronic eye diseases such as 
age-related macular degeneration to 
monitor any deterioration in their 
vision. OdySight provides insights to 
doctors, enabling them to make earlier 
interventions and improve patient 
outcomes. Developed in France in 
collaboration with a startup called 
Tilak Healthcare, OdySight is now 
helping patients in six countries.

In 2021, we added five Novartis Biome 
hubs in Germany, Spain, Brazil, 
Singapore and sub-Saharan Africa, 
expanding the total network to 
11 locations.

Digital solutions for  
global health
One of the first companies to partner 
with the Novartis Biome was Hemex 
Health, which developed a small, 
automated testing device – already 
approved for use in Ghana – to quickly 
detect genetic blood disorders such 
as sickle cell disease. The Novartis 
Biome is now working with Hemex 
Health on an extensive research 
implementation study to support 
expanded use of the device in primary 
care settings in sub-Saharan Africa, 
which carries 80% of the global 
disease burden.

We continued to work on an initiative 
co-founded by Novartis that aims to 
strengthen the foundations of digital 
healthcare systems in low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs). 
Partners include the University of 
Oslo in Norway, which has developed 
the world’s largest open-source 
health and disease information 
management system for LMICs, 

Improving heart health in China

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in China. AI Nurse 
is a digital health app, developed in collaboration with Tencent, that 
leverages the WeChat social media platform to make it easier for 
patients with heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases to 
manage disease progression. 

Hospitals enroll patients with the AI Nurse app after treatment for a cardiac event. 
Upon discharge, patients send regular updates to their doctor via an AI-enabled 
chatbot, which provides medication reminders and recommendations for diet and 
exercise. The app alerts the doctor to signs of deterioration, helping to determine if 
follow-up care is needed.

At the end of 2021, usage of AI Nurse had grown to more than 300 000 patients, 
from around 20 000 in the prior year. More than 5 000 healthcare professionals and 
over 1 000 hospitals in at least 200 cities across China are using AI Nurse. We are in 
the process of expanding AI Nurse to hypertension (high blood pressure).

and respectful of human rights in our 
use of AI. We created these guidelines 
in collaboration with leading ethicists 
from the International Bioethics 
Advisory Committee, and specialists 
in AI and data privacy. The position 
outlines our commitment to data 
privacy, security, accountability and 
environmental sustainability. We are 
taking steps to integrate these 
principles across the organization. 

Effective cybersecurity

We have robust governance, policies 
and systems in place to ensure the 
security of our data and IT systems, 
including Board-level oversight of 
cybersecurity through the Risk 
Committee, and management-level 
responsibility through our Chief 
Information Security Officer. Novartis 
did not experience any material cyber-
security incidents in 2021. 

To prevent system interruptions, we 
have business continuity plans that 
we test at least every six months. We 
conduct internal vulnerability analyses 
as well as external testing via a third 
party to ensure the effectiveness of 
our controls. 

The Novartis Global Information 
Management Policy is available to all 
employees via the Novartis intranet. 
We include cybersecurity in our Code 
of Ethics commitments and require 
suppliers to implement organizational 
security policies and standards.

known as DHIS2. It is currently in use 
in more than 73 countries. Together 
with our partners, we are adding 
disease metadata packages for our 
global health flagship programs to 
DHIS2, along with other enhance-
ments, to enable countries to further 
reduce supply chain bottlenecks and 
improve access to medicine. Novartis 
teams are using the system to support 
our malaria programs as well.

In addition, we launched a partnership 
with Hewlett Packard Enterprise to 
accelerate the use of data and digital 
technologies for global health solu-
tions. The first use case is a disease 
surveillance platform for dengue fever, 
which the World Health Organization 
has listed as a top 10 global health 
threat. For more information about 
how we address global heath chal-
lenges, please see the section “Build 
trust with society.” 

Embedding data and 
digital in our operations 

We use technology to drive greater 
efficiency and cost savings across our 
operations. For example, a platform in 
our manufacturing operations called 
SpotOn Insights Center provides 
multiple digital solutions to help 
maximize economy of scale, reduce 
throughput times and optimize 
inventories. One of these solutions 
already helps 18 production sites to 
optimize finished goods supply chains 
for more than 400 of our products.

In addition, we are automating core 
operational processes at scale by 
deploying robot cognitive automation 
– also known as “bots” – across our 
Customer & Technology Solutions 
organization. One example is an 
intelligent assistant that automates 
large parts of the writing of medical 
reports. Bots are also helping to 
resolve (either partially or fully) 
approximately 80% of user requests 
to our enterprise-wide IT helpdesk.

We promote training opportunities  
to develop digital skills among our 
employees. We have expanded our 
data science training and mentoring 
programs, which we launched in 
2020. We have also invested in a 
learning platform for data science 
coding skills, which has been used by 
over 850 employees who spent a total 
of over 11 000 hours on the platform 
in 2021. For more examples of our 
progress in building digital skills 
across Novartis, please see the 
section “Unleash the power of our 
people.”

Using data and AI respon si-
bly and securely 

In 2021, we completed the rollout of  
a new data management process – 
covering the entire data life cycle –  
to accelerate our digital transforma-
tion while ensuring data privacy. The 
new process spans nearly 5 million 
data sets, covering functions includ-
ing R&D, finance, operations and 
pro curement. Each domain has a  
data owner who is responsible for 
making their data available to the 
enterprise with the right quality 
and traceability, while also ensuring 
correct usage. These leaders are 
working together to unify data govern-
ance and processes across the 
organization and ensure that data is  
a strategic reusable asset for the 
company. 

In 2021, we published our 
commitment to the ethical 
and responsible use of 
artificial intelligence

The use of new technologies such as 
AI creates new ethical questions, 
including how to avoid biases in data. 
In 2021, we published our commit-
ment to the ethical and responsible 
use of AI to show the steps we are 
taking to be transparent, responsible

OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2021

Our employees are critical to fulfilling 
our purpose of reimagining medicine 
to improve and extend people’s lives. 
We depend on the skills and creativity 
of our people to develop and produce 
new medicines, and deliver them to 
patients. Our aspiration is for every 
employee to feel inspired by our 
purpose, be curious about new ideas, 
and work in an unbossed environment 
that encourages teamwork, initiative 
and innovation.

In 2021, we made progress in trans-
forming our culture to attract and retain 
the best talent to support our strategy. 
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we 
explored new working models that 
allow employees to maximize their 
performance. We continued to 
promote digital skills across the 
organization and reached more 
leaders with our flagship leadership 
development program, while becom-
ing a more diverse, equitable and 
inclusive organization.

The score for engagement in our 
quarterly employee survey stood at 78 
in Q4 2021, compared to 80 in Q4 
2020. The latest score was 5 points 
higher than the industry benchmark 
and was broadly consistent across 
genders, with scores of 78 for men 
and 79 for women. Engagement 
favorability, which measures the 
percentage of “agree” or “strongly 
agree” survey responses, was 86% in 
the fourth quarter, compared with 
87% a year earlier.

In 2021, we continued to score highly 
in environmental, social and govern-
ance (ESG) ratings on human capital. 
For example, Novartis improved its 
performance in the S&P Global 
Corporate Sustainability Assessment, 
with strong ESG scores achieved in 
the areas of human capital develop-
ment, labor practices, and talent 
attraction and retention.

Evolving ways of 
working

COVID-19 has reshaped the global 
working environment. In an internal 
survey, more than three-quarters of 
Novartis employees said they wanted 
to continue with a mix of office-based 
and remote working post-pandemic 
– consistent with external trends.

In this environment, we embarked on 
a multiyear program called Choice 
with Responsibility to explore new 
working models. The aim is to give 
employees greater flexibility in how 
they work to optimize their well-being 
and performance while maintaining a 
focus on productivity and innovation. 
As part of this program, we continued 
a policy introduced in 2020 for 
employees to choose how, when and 
where they work within their country 
(and in the US, within their state) of 
employment, in alignment with their 
teams to ensure a continued focus on 
collaboration and innovation.

Choice with Responsibility applies to 
all employees, but we recognize there 
is a wide diversity of roles within the 
organization. Some production work 
and laboratory research, for example, 
may not allow as much flexibility as 
other roles. The choices about how, 
when and where people work will 
therefore be different based on their 
role; the nature of the team; and 
health, safety and legal/regulatory 
requirements.

During 2021, we conducted around 70 
local and global experiments involving 
a total of 25 000 employees, which are 
giving clarity on the path forward. The 
results will provide the basis for our 
ways of working in the future.

For example, 500 employees in 15 
countries took part in a three-month 

experiment to understand and address 
the challenges of moving to a virtual 
environment. The results showed 70% 
of participants prefer a hybrid arrange-
ment in which their time is divided 
between their home and workplace. 
Meanwhile, teams that determined 
their own solutions on how to work 
together felt more able to collaborate 
and manage their workload compared 
with teams that had not, leading to an 
overall feeling of Novartis having 
improved as a place to work.

In 2021, we continued expanding our 
global program to help employees 
manage their physical, mental and 
social well-being. All 20 000 Novartis 
leaders and 2 189 other employees 
took part in an e-learning program to 
enhance their well-being, while 57 001 
people visited a “How are you feel-
ing?” webpage with resources to help 
them manage stress and other topics. 
In addition, 14 257 employees 
attended workshops during a well-
being month, with 96% of attendees 
saying they would apply learnings in 
their daily work. Meanwhile, two 
third-party smartphone apps provided 
by Novartis were used by 32 709 
employees to increase self-aware-
ness and develop positive habits in 
areas including movement, nutrition, 
recovery and mindset, which are 
important for holistic well-being.

In another important change, we 
transformed our approach to perfor-
mance management and development 
by replacing annual performance 
ratings with a flexible, continuous 
system of coaching, feedback and 
recognition by managers and col-
leagues. Teams and individuals create 
objectives that include a focus on 
longer-term impact over several years. 
In addition, managers and employees 
have regular discussions on topics 
including progress toward goals, devel-
opment, feedback and well-being.

Learning and 
development

In 2021, we continued to focus on 
promoting a culture of curiosity and 
learning. This was the third year of our 
Go Big on Learning initiative, which 
involves a USD 100 million investment 
in addition to the normal annual 
training budget of USD 200 million. 

Our aspiration is for every internal 
employee to spend 100 hours a year 
on learning. We achieved an average 
of 52.1 training hours per internal 
employee in 2021, broadly in line with 
the previous year.

Our focus on learning and develop-
ment is being recognized by current 
and prospective employees. The score 
for learning engagement and growth 
in the OurVoice survey remained at an 
all-time high of 75 in 2021, compared 
to an industry benchmark of 71. In 
addition, opportunities for learning 
and career growth were cited by 
successful applicants as a leading 
reason for wanting to join Novartis.

Learning requirements reflected the 
change to more flexible working 
practices as well as greater demand 
for digital skills to support our strat-
egy. Across both LinkedIn Learning 
and Coursera, we registered a total  
of more than 47 000 active users  
and more than 105 000 courses 
completed in 2021. We also main-
tained access to the Coursera friends 
and family program for 15 000 users. 

Approximately 16 000 employees 
used a digital awareness hub to 
enhance their knowledge and skills in 
data science, artificial intelligence (AI) 
and related areas. In 2021, training 
related to digital skills more than 
doubled from the previous year, based 
on an analysis provided by Coursera. 
Novartis was ahead of the industry 
benchmark in data analysis and other 
areas, according to Coursera.

Furthermore, we launched a new 
learning platform for 10 000 employ-
ees, primarily in our commercial 
operations, that uses AI to customize 
learning on digital skills based on an 
individual’s role and daily activities. 

Unbossed: learning to lead differently

The idea behind “unbossed” is that people are most creative and 
productive when they are empowered to pursue their ideas. We want 
Novartis leaders to provide clarity and accountability for their teams, 
remove obstacles, and empower others to reach their potential.

In 2021, more than 5 000 leaders took part in a development program called the 
Unbossed Leadership Experience (ULE), which provides them with the skills needed 
to drive our cultural transformation in an environment conducive to personal growth. 
We are now nearly halfway to meeting our ambition of bringing ULE to all 20 000 
leaders at Novartis.

In an employee survey, teams reporting to senior leaders who completed the program 
showed higher results for engagement (3.8 percentage points), empowerment (2.9 
1  Placeholder for footnote to explain change in learning hours data methodology
percentage points), and feeling safe to speak up (3.6 percentage points) compared 
with the company benchmark. Teams working closely with ULE leaders were also 
more comfortable with experimentation and potential failure, according to a separate 
feedback process, suggesting they are becoming more open to innovation.

Employees
completed D&I training

The platform, which will be rolled out 
to the full Novartis organization in 
2022, is intended to build new skills 
and capabilities to support our 
enterprise data and digital strategy.

In addition, we launched pilots involv-
ing around 15 000 people for two 
AI-powered platforms that give 
employees access to resources for 
career planning, learning and mentor-
ing, as well as opportunities to join 
short-term projects to develop new 
skills. The aim is to help employees 
navigate their careers and build the 
skills they need to succeed at Novartis. 
Global rollout is planned for 2022. 

Diversity and inclusion

We seek to create a diverse, equitable 
and inclusive environment that 
provides equal opportunities for all 
employees and where everyone is 
treated with dignity and respect. We 
do this not only because it is right, but 
also because it helps to generate new 
ideas and brings us closer to the 
diverse perspectives of patients and 
other stakeholders. We recognize that 
everyone plays a part in building an 
inclusive environment, and in 2021, 
97% of our employees completed the 
first global e-training on diversity and 
inclusion (D&I).

A key element of our D&I strategy is 
gender equity, and we made progress 
in 2021 toward our Equal Pay Interna-
tional Coalition (EPIC) pledge to 
achieve gender balance in manage-
ment and improve pay equity and 
transparency processes by 2023.  
The percentage of women in manage-
ment increased to 46% in 2021 from 
45% in 2020. 

Based on the latest data available as 
of December 31, 2020, Novartis has a 
global median pay gap of –2.3% and a 
global mean pay gap of +3.3%, 
compared with –3.1% and +3.6%, 
respectively, in the prior year. While 
we acknowledge this percentage is 
influenced by worldwide workforce 
demographics, this is significantly 

ahead of the Bloomberg benchmarks 
of +19% median and +21% mean for 
the same period.

In 2021, we achieved external pay 
transparency in a further 10 countries, 
including Switzerland and the US, 
bringing the total to 16 countries. We 
continue to extend this initiative, 
through which employees can com-
pare their pay to external bench-
marks, and by February 2022 we 
expect pay transparency to cover 
more than 50 000 employees across 
33 countries. 

We have eliminated historical salary 
data from 80% of global hiring to 
reduce the risk of gender bias when 
making job offers. We are taking steps 
to apply this to every job offer world-
wide by 2023. 

Novartis was the first global pharma-
ceutical company to support the 
United Nations Standards of Conduct 
for Business to tackle discrimination 
against lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, queer and intersex 
(LGBTQI) employees. In 2021, we 
distributed an updated guide for 
employees and managers to support 
employees in gender transitioning. We 
are working to include coverage for 
gender dysphoria, the condition in 
which someone feels a strong desire 
to change gender, in Novartis com-
pany healthcare plans, where possi-
ble. We continued our senior sponsor-
ship program for LGBTQI employees 
with reverse mentoring for partici-
pants, including two members of the 
Executive Committee of Novartis. 

We recognize the need to provide an 
environment where people with 
disabilities can perform at their best. 
In 2021, we developed a strategy and 
solutions to involve them fully in the 
workplace and ensure they have the 
same opportunities as everyone at 
Novartis. This was done in conjunction 
with external partners, including the 
International Labor Organization’s 
Global Business and Disability Net-
work; the Center for Disability and 
Integration at the University of St.

Gallen; and The Valuable 500, a group 
of global organizations putting disabil-
ity on their leadership agenda.

Novartis is committed to promoting 
racial equity both inside and outside 
the company. In 2021, we announced 
a 10-year collaboration with 26 
historically Black colleges, universities 
and medical schools in the US to 
address the causes of disparity in 
healthcare. For more information, see 
the section “Deliver transformative 
innovation.” 

We encourage employees with shared 
interests, experiences and back-
grounds to form voluntary communi-
ties called Employee Resource 
Groups (ERGs), which give them a 
forum to network with peers and 
ensure their perspectives are  
recognized. There are more than  
80 such ERGs at Novartis, including 
for LGBTQI employees, working 
parents, employees with disabilities, 
and other groups.  

Our progress in building a diverse and 
inclusive environment was recognized 
externally: Novartis was included in 
the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index 
for the third year in a row.

Supporting and protec-
ting our employees

Where possible, Novartis provides 
benefits to all full- and part-time 
employees. These vary between 
countries but generally include 
comprehensive health, well-being and 
retirement benefits; generous vaca-
tion policies; and a global recognition 
program. Our enterprise and digital 
training programs are generally 
available to all employees regardless 
of contract type. 

All Novartis employees worldwide are 
eligible for a minimum 14 weeks of 
paid parental leave on the birth or 
adoption of a child, effective from 
their first day of employment. A total 
of 4 632 people took advantage of 
this benefit during the year, based on 

data that was available for 33 coun-
tries covering 63% of our employee 
population. Of the total employees 
taking parental leave, 59% were 
female and 41% were male.

In 2021, Novartis launched an 
Employee Share Purchase Plan, which 
enables employees to voluntarily 
purchase Novartis shares at a dis-
counted price. The plan is global in 
scope: The first phase of its four-year 
rollout, starting in 2021, covers North 
America (the US, Puerto Rico and 
Canada), with subsequent waves in 
other countries and regions starting in 
2022, 2023 and 2024. All permanent 
employees are eligible for the plan 
(with certain exceptions).

Keeping employees safe

In 2021, we took further steps to 
protect the health and safety of 
employees as the impact of COVID-19 
continued to be felt worldwide. 

In countries where sufficient vaccines 
were available – and where the 
guidance was in line with local laws 
and regulations – we asked employ-
ees to only come on site if they were 
either fully vaccinated or fully recov-
ered from COVID-19 within the 
previous six months. Local manage-
ment could decide to adjust these 
principles based on the local regula-
tions and in-country situation. COVID-
19 test results could also be accepted 
as a means to access sites if deemed 
appropriate by the local management 
team. When on site, employees were 
asked to continue to adhere to safety 
and hygiene measures, with an 
emphasis on closely following the 
rules introduced in 2020.

Meanwhile, we made the Everbridge 
global emergency communications 
tool available to 160 000 Novartis 
employees as well as chosen partners 
and suppliers in 2021. This provided 
advance warning of any security, 
health or environmental risks that 
could affect employees, whether 
working on site, at home, or in other 
remote locations. 

Engagement and 
volunteering

In 2021, we continued to strengthen 
our engagement and volunteering 
program, building on 25 years of 
Novartis employees giving back to  
the communities in which we operate. 
We have shifted our focus from a 
single day of community activity each 
year to long-term partnerships that 
are aligned with our strategy and 
where our support can have a sustain-
able impact. 

Since 2015, the program’s virtual 
platform has been used by a total of 
23 346 employees in more than 60 
countries, with activities ranging from 
on-the-ground projects to virtual 
volunteering from home. Employees 
are empowered to share their skills 
and experience in a way that best 
suits their interests and availability 
– with no specific time limits on 
activities.

Volunteering programs during 2021 
included the US President’s Malaria 
Initiative, the International Committee 
of the Red Cross, Save the Children, 
Last Mile Health, The Max Founda-
tion, and the Tropical Health and 
Education Trust. 

We began a partnership with the 
International Rescue Committee in 
which Novartis volunteers supported 
22 refugees, migrants and asylum-
seekers to sustain small businesses  
in the US. We also engaged with the 
Tent Partnership for Refugees and 
committed to provide 50 mentoring 
opportunities for LGBTQI refugees in 
the US, Germany and the UK over the 
next three years. 

In addition, we are preparing to launch 
in early 2022 a new digital tool that 
matches the needs of our partners 
with the skills and interests of our 
employees. Going forward, this will 
enable us to better measure the 
impact of our volunteering activities.

Patients reached
through access approaches

Leading the way on 
access and global health

members of the Executive Committee 
of Novartis have access metrics in 
their annual performance objectives.

Improving access to medicines 
remains one of the world’s greatest 
healthcare challenges. At Novartis, we 
know that building trust with society 
depends not only on finding new 
treatments but also on making them 
available to as many people as possible. 
Our 2021 materiality assessment 
identified access as one of our most 
material topics. 

We seek to expand access to our 
medicines to underserved patient 
populations in both developed and 
developing countries, while address-
ing major global health challenges.  
We reached 56.2 million patients in 
2021 through access approaches,  
and we have set ambitious targets to 
reinforce our commitments. Relevant 

The Access to Medicine Foundation 
has recognized our efforts in this area, 
ranking us second in the 2021 Access 
to Medicine Index among 20 of the 
world’s largest healthcare companies.

Novartis access principles 

We aim to implement an access 
strategy for all new medicines 
launched. These strategies include 
innovative pricing and access models, 
earlier launches in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs), and 
approaches to strengthen healthcare 
systems. Information in this chapter 
on access and global health is organ-
ized according to the three pillars of 
the Novartis access principles (see 
infographic below).

Novartis access principles

R&D: We systematically assess our product 
portfolio against the unmet needs of 
underserved populations and integrate these 
needs, as appropriate, into our drug discovery 
and development strategy. We aim to make our 
products available in countries with the highest 
burden of the disease to be treated.

affordability

access  
principles

research & 
development

healthcare 
systems

Affordability: We aim to price our medicines 
based on the value they deliver to patients, 
healthcare systems and society. We work to 
make our medicines available by adopting 
innovative access and pricing models, taking 
into account local income levels, affordability 
barriers and economic realities. 

System strengthening: We work with 
governments and other partners to lower 
barriers to healthcare delivery and support 
quality patient care in areas where we can 
have the greatest impact.

Our targets for access and 
global health 
In 2020, Novartis committed to 
increase patient reach with our strate-
gic innovative therapies in LMICs by at 
least 200% by 2025 (vs. 2019). In 
addition, we aim to increase patient 
reach of our four global health flagship 
programs in LMICs by at least 50% 
over the same period. To reinforce our 
commitment to these targets, we 
issued a EUR 1.85 billion sustainability-
linked bond1 in 2020. Bondholders are 
entitled to receive a higher amount of 
interest if Novartis does not meet its 
access targets. 

We are on track to meet our targets. 
In 2021, we achieved a 36% increase 
in patient reach with our strategic 
innovative therapies compared with 
the previous year (up 73% from 2019). 
Patients reached through our global 

1  For more information on our SLB, including measurement 

criteria, please see the bond prospectus at www.novartis.com/
slbprospectus.

flagship programs declined by 26% 
from the prior year, when we saw a 
sharp increase due to our ability to 
maintain delivery despite wider 
COVID-19 related supply disruptions. 
However, the latest figure was still 
more than double our 2019 baseline 
(please see the table on page 72 for 
more details).

Access principle 1: research 
and development

We systematically assess our research 
and development portfolio against the 
unmet needs of underserved popula-
tions. We select countries and sites to 
implement clinical trials based on 
medical needs, and we only initiate 
clinical trials in countries where we 
intend to make the medicine available 
to patients. We also work with govern-
ments and nongovernmental organiza-
tions to increase clinical trial capabili-
ties in LMICs, with the goal of bringing 
more innovation to patients. 

For more information on our research 
and development activities for malaria, 
sickle cell disease and other 
neglected diseases, please see the 
section “Deliver transformative 
innovation.”

Adaptive development
Beyond our investigational therapies, 
we also adapt existing medicines for 
different patient groups or for diverse 
environments. In 2021, for example, 
our Sandoz teams worked on a pediat-
ric-friendly formulation of hydroxyurea 
to treat SCD that received conditional 
approval in Ghana less than six months 
after submission. 

Our adaptive development work 
supports our global health flagship 
programs, as well as a range of other 
therapeutic areas. For more informa-
tion, please see the “Selected adaptive 
development projects” table in the 
appendix of this report.

Our global health priorities 

Our work on global health is aligned with our overall efforts 
to expand access to our medicines. We follow an inte-
grated approach for the control or elimination of four 
diseases where there has been market failure and little 
investment in research and development:

Sickle cell disease (ScD) is a genetic blood disorder that 
affects more than 6 million people worldwide. While around 
80% of the global disease burden is in Africa, SCD also 
affects approximately 100 000 children and adults in the 
US. Novartis is exploring new therapeutics and working to 
improve care for SCD patients in both developed and 
developing countries.

malaria is preventable and curable, yet it remains one of 
the most deadly infectious diseases in the world. Novartis 
has been at the forefront of the fight against malaria for 
more than two decades, launching the first fixed-dose 
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and working 
with partners to deliver more than 1 billion antimalarials, the 
majority without profit.

leprosy causes physical disability and stigma for approxi-
mately 1.5 million people worldwide. Multidrug therapy 
donated by Novartis has been a cornerstone of global 
elimination efforts, leading to the treatment of more than  
7 million people since 2000. 

chagas disease affects approximately 6 million people, 
mainly in Latin America. Starting as a parasitic disease, it 
can lead to chronic cardiac disorders in up to 30% of 
patients. Novartis is active in drug discovery for new antipar-
asitic compounds and clinical research on Chagas cardio-
myopathy, as well as health system strengthening initiatives.

In addition, through the Novartis Institute for Tropical 
Diseases (NITD), we continue to research and develop a 
promising portfolio of drug candidates for the treatment of 
neglected tropical diseases that affect around 1.6 billion 
people worldwide, including dengue fever, diarrheal 
disease and visceral leishmaniasis.

affordability 
We use a combination of approaches 
to help patients across the income 
pyramid access our medicines. We 
seek to price our medicines based on 
the value they deliver to patients, 
healthcare systems and society. We 
aim to implement tiered pricing for 
launches in our Pharmaceuticals and 
Oncology business units, taking into 
account income levels, local affordabil-
ity barriers and economic realities, 
while maintaining the sustainability of 
our business. We also make our 
medicines available through patient

through various approaches, which include the flagship programs (targeting malaria, sickle 
cell disease, leprosy and Chagas disease) as well as a core portfolio of medicines for non 
communicable diseases.

6  The patient number is calculated based on treatments delivered and the following elements: 

daily treatment doses, treatment duration, treatment adherence and potential treatment 
overlap (NCD patients often take several drugs). The treatment adherence and treatment 
overlap factors are based on assumptions from developed markets. Includes patients reached 
through flagship programs (malaria, sickle cell disease, leprosy, Chagas disease), patients 
reached with donations (leprosy and fasciolisis), and patients reached with other Sandoz 
medicines

Value-based pricing
We aim to price our medicines 
according to the value they deliver to 
patients, healthcare systems and 
society. We believe this approach 
incentivizes healthcare systems to 
focus on interventions that deliver the 
most effective, efficient and sustaina-
ble outcomes. 

In 2021, for example, we announced a 
world-first agreement with the UK’s 
public healthcare system to make 
Leqvio, our cholesterol-lowering 
medicine, available to patients in 
England through an innovative popula-
tion health management approach. 
The agreement followed a positive 
recommendation by the UK’s National 
Institute for Health and Care Excel-
lence, which determines whether 
medicines represent value-for-money 
to the country’s healthcare system. 

Novartis was also one of the first 
pharmaceutical companies to enter 
into value-based contracting for 
medicines, linking pricing and reim-
bursement rates to specific outcomes 
– including for Zolgensma, our break-
through gene therapy for patients with 
spinal muscular atrophy.

We consider the following elements in 
proposing the price of our innovative 
medicines:

patient value: Do our medicines help 
increase patient quality of life and/or 
patient safety?

healthcare system value: Do our 
medicines help increase efficiency 
and/or reduce costs elsewhere in the 
system, for example by preventing 
hospitalizations?

Societal value: Do our medicines 
have an impact beyond the immediate 
healthcare benefit, such as by helping 
to improve economic productivity?

A variety of approaches exist on how 
to measure the value of our medi-
cines. We aim to generate transpar-

ent, real-world evidence to support 
the most accurate possible value 
assessment for our medicines.

While we take all of these factors into 
account in proposing the price of our 
medicines, in the majority of cases the 
final price is the result of a negotiation 
with payers. We stand ready to support 
and strengthen healthcare systems in 
the journey toward value-based 
healthcare, so the price of medicines 
overall can more closely and consist-
ently align with our principles without 
limiting patient access to care.

value-based pricing, please see

Equitable commercial models
In 2014, Novartis introduced an 
emerging market brand (EMB) strat-
egy to expand access to innovative 
medicines to people in LMICs, in a 
way that is sustainable for our busi-
ness and supports governments in 
responding to unmet medical needs. 

In 2021, we launched 26 EMBs in our 
Novartis Pharmaceuticals portfolio 
and five in Oncology. These launches 
helped Novartis reach 483 459 
patients through EMBs, a 31% 
increase from 2020. 

Entresto, our heart failure medicine, is 
a key contributor to our target to 
increase patient reach for our strate-
gic innovative therapies. EMBs for 
Entresto, which number 42 overall, 
achieved a 39% increase in patient 
reach and 43% growth in sales 
compared with 2020. 

We continue to narrow or eliminate 
the time lag between launches in 
Europe and in LMICs. For instance, 

we launched the EMB of our lung 
cancer treatment Tabrecta in India in 
November, at least six months ahead 
of expected first launch in Europe.

Novartis Access is our portfolio of 
medicines to address public health 
needs – in particular noncommunica-
ble diseases – in lower-income 
countries. The program offers 15 on- 
and off-patent medicines, which in 
2021 were provided to governments 
and public sector customers in 11 
countries across Africa, Asia and 
Latin America. Since 2015, Novartis 
Access medicines have reached more 
than 5.4 million patients. 

We also use social business models 
to reach patients in countries where 
Novartis has limited or no presence. In 
2021, through a program called Global 
Health Markets, we reached patients 
in Cuba, Cambodia and Laos. 

Our community solutions, known as 
Healthy Family programs, provide 
health education and strengthen 
healthcare infrastructure for popula-
tions living at the base of the income 
pyramid in India, Kenya, Uganda and 
Vietnam. In 2021, we expanded our 
geographical coverage in India and 
Vietnam, and we aim to launch the 
program in additional underserved 
markets. Since 2007, Healthy Family 
programs have delivered health 
education to more than 75 million 
people.

OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2021

31%

Increase in  
patients reached
through emerging market 
brands (vs. 2020)

~300 000

Patients in the UK 
at high risk of a second cardiovascular 
event are expected to be treated with 
Leqvio in the community setting over 
three years

To drive access in sub-Saharan Africa 
(SSA), we established a dedicated 
Novartis SSA unit of about 700 
employees that aims to expand the 
availability of our full portfolio of 
medicines, taking a high-volume, 
lower-price approach – with an 
aspiration to double patient reach in 
the region by 2022.

For example, we aim to bring afforda-
ble cancer treatments to 22 countries 
in SSA through our Cancer Access 
Partnership (CAP) with the Clinton 
Health Access Initiative. In 2021, we 
implemented the program in more 
than six countries, reaching patients 
with breast, prostate and cervical 
cancer through our CAP product line, 
which includes patented medicines 
and Sandoz generics. Medicines are 
offered at a competitive yet sustaina-
ble price, and we are working with 
partners to minimize markups on CAP 
products for patients purchasing their 
treatments out of pocket. Together 
with our partners, we aim to optimize 
the continuum of care across the 
patient journey, including through 
health system strengthening activities. 

Zero-profit models
In 2021, we reached the milestone of  
1 billion treatments of our antimalarial 
medicine Coartem delivered since 
1999, with more than 90% supplied 
without profit. For more information, 
please see “One billion antimalarials 
delivered to patients” on page 76.

Donations
Through our donation programs, 
Novartis supports LMICs in their 
efforts to treat patients for neglected 
diseases or life-threatening conditions, 
and to provide medicines in areas 
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
natural disasters and extreme poverty.

One of our key programs is CMLPath 
to Care™, which connects people 
living with chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML) with effective treatments made 
available at no cost, professional 
medical capabilities, trained physicians 
and hands-on support. The initiative is 
implemented in 67 countries that are 
most urgently in need of medicines, as 
identified by the Access to Medicine 
Index. In 2021, the program reached 
more than 29 300 patients.

Leqvio: integrated access in action

Our cholesterol-lowering medicine Leqvio is a prime example of how we 
integrate innovative access strategies into the launch of our medicines.

Leqvio is approved in more than 50 countries to treat atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease, which accounts for over 85% of all cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths. As 
part of our access strategy, we aim to introduce emerging market brands for Leqvio with 
tiered pricing in LMICs and upper-middle-income countries to address affordability 
challenges, based on local feasibility assessments. We also intend to minimize time lags 
between first launch in Europe and launches in LMICs.

We also partner with health systems to improve patient outcomes. In the UK, for 
instance, Leqvio is provided under a first-of-its-kind population health management 
approach through the National Health Service in England; it is expected to treat up to 
300 000 patients at high risk of a second cardiovascular event in the community setting 
over three years. We are also exploring population health approaches in other markets. 
In Colombia, for example, we formed an alliance with the innovation chamber of the 
government and civil society stakeholders to help remove treatment barriers for more 
than 50 000 high-risk CVD patients.

For over 30 years, Novartis 
has been working with 
partners around the world  
to eliminate leprosy

For over 30 years, Novartis has been 
working with partners around the 
world to eliminate leprosy. Since 2000, 
Novartis has donated more than 68 
million blister packs of multidrug 
therapy (MDT) valued at approximately 
USD 119 million through the WHO, 
helping to treat more than 7.3 million 
leprosy patients worldwide. In 2021, we 
extended our donation agreement with 
the WHO, and reached more than  
75 000 patients. This was lower that 
the number of patients reached in 
2020, primarily due to countries 
reducing their screening activities  
amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The new five-year agreement with the 
WHO also covers the continuing 
donation of triclabendazole for the 
treatment of fascioliasis, a disease 
caused by parasites known as liver 
fluke. Novartis has been donating the 
drug to the WHO since 2005, helping 
to treat around 2 million fascioliasis 
patients in more than 30 countries. 

Operation Smile and Direct Relief to 
donate medicines to people affected 
by poverty and disaster. In 2021, 
Sandoz donated products worth 
approximately USD 900 000 to these 
organizations. Sandoz also collaborates 
with World Child Cancer, a charity that 
aims to improve diagnosis and access 
to treatment for children with cancer in 
LMICs. In the first half of 2021, the 
partnership reached 128 children with 
cancer and trained 506 healthcare 
professionals in the Philippines. 

Patient support programs 
Our patient support programs help 
patients access medicines they could 
not afford due to financial hardship, 
lack of insurance, or inadequate 
reimbursement. They also help 
patients better manage their medica-
tion and disease outcomes through 
services including education, nurse 
programs and call centers. 

One example is the Novartis Patient 
Assistance Foundation Inc. (NPAF), 
which provides medicines at no cost 

Another program is Novartis Oncology 
Access, which shares the cost of 
medicines with government healthcare 
systems, charities and other payers, or 
directly with patients without health-
care coverage who are unable to pay 
the full cost. In 2021, more than 29 
400 patients in seven countries 
benefited from the Novartis Oncology 
portfolio in multiple disease areas.

Other examples include the Vale Mais 
Saúde™ program in Brazil, which 
reached more than 1.7 million patients 
in 2021. The program provides 
discounts on Novartis therapies for 
chronic conditions and promotes 
disease awareness and treatment 
adherence. In China, meanwhile, we 
reached 31 000 Cosentyx patients 
through a program designed to 
support patients and healthcare 
professionals with medication adher-
ence and disease awareness. Overall, 
our patient support programs helped 
more than 3.8 million patients in 2021.

Managed access programs 
Physicians sometimes seek access to 
medicines that are not yet approved 
or available in their country to treat 
patients with serious or life-threaten-
ing conditions. Novartis Managed 
Access Programs (MAPs) address 
this need by making certain investiga-
tional or unapproved treatments 
available to eligible patients.

Patients
receiving treatment through 
managed access programs

7.6 m

Lives saved since 2000
due to adopting ACTs as a first-line 
treatment for malaria, along with 
disease prevention efforts and better 
diagnostics, according to the WHO

In 2021, we reviewed 8 559 MAP 
requests from physicians. We 
approved 95% of those requests from 
95 countries and across 62 com-
pounds. At the end of 2021, more than 
13 000 patients were receiving 
treatment through MAPs.

We fulfilled our 2021 commitment to 
make Zolgensma, our one-time gene 
therapy to treat pediatric patients with 
spinal muscular atrophy, available to 
up to 100 patients via a global MAP. 
Further, Tabrecta was provided to 838 
patients suffering from lung cancer. 

Since 2017, Novartis has collaborated 
with an external Independent Bioethics 
Advisory Committee (IBAC), which 
provides analysis and recommendations 
on Novartis guidelines and policies for 
the ethical conduct of clinical research, 
and on selected ethical challenges that 
may arise in clinical trials, development 
programs, managed access programs 
and other areas across Novartis. The 
IBAC is made up of bioethicists, 
clinicians, healthcare practitioners, 
patient advocates and other experts 
appropriate to the problem at hand.

Post-trial access programs
Novartis has a comprehensive post-
trial access (PTA) policy to ensure 
continuity of treatment for patients 
who have participated in a confirma-
tory, Novartis-sponsored clinical trial 
designed to demonstrate superiority 
versus a placebo or another drug. 
Patients who have derived clinical 
benefit from an investigational treat-
ment can continue to receive it, free 
of charge, until it is commercially avail-
able and accessible locally.

Our PTA commitment applies regard-
less of the severity of the disease, the 
availability of alternative therapies, or 
the geographical location of the 
clinical trial. PTA commitments were 
incorporated in all in-scope trials 
approved in 2021.

We also convene a cross-functional 
consultation board to provide guid-
ance on PTA activities and ensure a 
consistent approach across the 
company in accordance with our 
Commitment to Patients and Caregiv-
ers and the Novartis Position on 
Post-Trial Access.

One billion antimalarials delivered to patients

For decades, Novartis has been involved in the fight against malaria, 
a disease that causes hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide 
despite it being treatable and curable. 

In 1999, Novartis launched the first fixed-dose artemisinin-based combination therapy 
(ACT). In 2001, in a landmark agreement with the WHO, we were the first healthcare 
company to commit to supply antimalarial treatments to the public sector of endemic 
countries without profit. 

In 2021, we reached the milestone of 1 billion treatments of our ACT delivered since 
1999, with more than 90% supplied without profit. More than 450 million were a 
pediatric formulation developed jointly with Medicines for Malaria Venture. The WHO 
estimates that adopting ACTs as a first-line treatment for malaria, together with 
prevention efforts and better diagnostics, have saved 7.6 million lives since 2000.

Malaria is still endemic in many countries. Moreover, increased temperatures and 
humidity due to climate change threaten to increase the number of insects that carry 
vector-borne diseases like malaria. We remain committed to finding solutions for 
patients: Alongside our access programs, Novartis is advancing the next generation 
of antimalarials, with several promising candidates in our development pipeline.

Access principle 3: 
strengthening healthcare 
systems

A medicine is only as good as the 
system that delivers it. Improving 
access to healthcare requires long-
term investments in healthcare infra-
structure. We work with governments 
and partners to strengthen healthcare 
systems and lower barriers to health-
care delivery. Several examples are 
provided below. For more information 
on our health system strengthening 
framework, please see the Novartis 
corporate website.

Tackling SCD in Africa 
Launched in Ghana in 2019, our Africa 
sickle cell disease (SCD) program is a 
public-private partnership that 
encompasses newborn screening, 
diagnosis, treatment, education, 
research and advocacy. In 2021, the 
program was active in Ghana and 
Uganda. Novartis continues to work 
with our partners, including the 
ministries of health in both countries, 
to strengthen healthcare systems for 
the safe and sustainable delivery of 
SCD treatments for patients. In 2022, 
we aim to launch the program in 
Tanzania and Kenya, where the 
government recently launched 
national guidelines for the manage-
ment of SCD. As part of our efforts to 
support treatment for SCD in Africa, 
we received conditional approval for 
our SCD treatment crizanlizumab in 
Ghana in December 2021, only six 
months after submission. Also in 2021, 
we received approval in Ghana for a 
pediatric-friendly formulation of 
hydroxyurea to treat SCD (see 
“Adaptive development”).

Addressing malaria and SCD in India 
India has the world’s highest burden 
of malaria and SCD outside of Africa. 
Novartis is running a malaria screen-
ing campaign under the umbrella of 
the Novartis Healthy Family program 
(Arogya Parivar) in seven districts in 
Odisha state, a highly endemic area 
that bears almost a quarter of the 
country’s malaria burden. Since the 

start of the campaign in September 
2020, more than 121 000 people  
have been screened for malaria and 
potential co-morbidities at around  
2 200 health camps. Separately, 
Novartis and local authorities in India 
established the National SCD council, 
which aims to address policy-related 
gaps in delivering healthcare services 
to SCD patients. This resulted in 
dedicated or increased funding for 
SCD diagnosis and treatment across 
11 states in the country. We also 
collaborated with partners to conduct 
education and awareness programs 
on SCD in the states of Maharashtra, 
Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, cover-
ing a total of 80 districts, 250 health-
care professionals and 1 150 health-
care workers. We plan to expand this 
project in 2022.

Since the start of the 
campaign, more than  
121 000 people have been 
screened for malaria and 
potential co-morbidities 

Eliminating avoidable blindness 
One billion people worldwide live with 
preventable visual impairment due to 
a lack of access to basic eye care.  
Of these, an estimated 90% live in 
LMICs. In 2021, we implemented a 
program built upon an ecosystem of 
key partners, including Aravind Eye 
Care System, a network of hospitals 
in India that is one of the largest 
providers of eye care in the world, to 
tackle avoidable blindness in under-
served communities in India. In 
addition, our eXcellence in Ophthal-
mology Vision Awards (XOVA) have 
funded 44 projects across 27 LMICs 
to elevate community health educa-
tion activities, capability-building and 
training for healthcare professionals, 
and access to affordable eye care 
services. Moving forward, together 
with Aravind, XOVA and other global 
and local partners, we plan to expand 
the program to improve outcomes in 
underserved communities in SSA, 
Vietnam, the US and Bolivia.

The Novartis Foundation
The Novartis Foundation focuses  
on advancing digital and data-led 
approaches to population health, with 
a particular emphasis on cardiovascu-
lar disease (CVD), the leading cause 
of death globally.

Better Hearts Better Cities
Rapid urbanization in LMICs, and 
associated lifestyle changes, present 
increasing challenges to address CVD 
and its prime risk factor, hypertension 
(high blood pressure). Although 
therapeutic options exist, blood 
pressure control rates remain poor.  
In November, the Novartis Foundation 
published its strategy for addressing 
cardiovascular population health, 
known as the CARDIO approach,  
in the journal Cities & Health. 

This approach has been applied 
across different continents together 
with local city authorities and partners 
in the Better Hearts Better Cities 
initiative, which addresses hyperten-
sion and its underlying determinants 
by increasing early access to quality 
care, promoting partnerships, and 
maximizing the application of technol-
ogy to strengthen health systems. 
First results show that between 2018 
and 2019, blood pressure control 
rates in patients treated with medica-
tion improved in São Paulo (Brazil), 
Dakar (Senegal) and Ulaanbaatar 
(Mongolia). Full results will be pub-
lished in 2022. 

Reducing inequity in cardiovascular 
health
Our health is influenced by where we 
are born, grow, live, work and age; 
these factors are referred to as social 
determinants of health (SDoH). During 
the COVID-19 pandemic, SDoH put a 
spotlight on health inequities world-
wide, yet the differences in health 
outcomes between population groups 
reach far beyond the pandemic, 
especially when it comes to cardio-
vascular (CV) population health.

soft are applying artificial intelligence 
and advanced analytics to a combina-

Expanding access through 
generics and biosimilars
Our Sandoz Division, a leading global 
generics company, plays an important 
role in Novartis efforts to increase 
access to affordable, high-quality 
medicines for patients worldwide. In 
2021, Sandoz reached approximately 
490 million patients with its portfolio 
of around 1 000 molecules across a 
wide range of disease areas.

Generics and biosimilars enable 
healthcare systems to improve access 
while containing spending growth. In 
the US, for example, generics 
accounted for 90% of the volume but 
only 18% of the cost of prescription 
medicines in 2020, according to 
research firm IQVIA. 

Sandoz teams consider access in 
pricing strategies for all medicines, for 
example by typically entering the 
market well below the list price of the 
reference product, as well as taking 
local economic realities into account 
and acting to keep prices stable at 
times of market disruption – such as 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our portfolio of generics and biosimi-
lars increases the supply of affordable 
medicines across the income pyramid. 
They also provide the majority of 
products to our global health markets. 

As one of the world’s largest suppliers 
of antibiotics, Sandoz also plays a 
central role in our efforts to tackle 
antimicrobial resistance. For more

The Novartis US Foundation
The Novartis US Foundation seeks to 
improve health in underserved com-
munities in the US by creating innova-

expand access to healthcare and 
build trust within the healthcare 
system. 

In the US, health disparities affecting 
minority groups are endemic – an 
issue that was highlighted and exacer-
bated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 
2021, Novartis and the Novartis US 
Foundation announced plans to invest 
approximately USD 13.7 million to 
establish three research centers at 
Morehouse School of Medicine in 
Georgia, including a clinical trial 
center of excellence that could be a 
model for possible expansion to other 
historically Black colleges, universities 
and medical schools.

OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2021

Holding ourselves to 
high ethical standards

Acting in an ethical manner is essen-
tial to building trust with society. Our 
stakeholders not only expect us to do 
what is legally required, but also to fol-
low high standards of ethical behavior 
wherever we operate. 

Supporting ethical  
decision-making 
We are making progress in embed-
ding our Code of Ethics across the 
organization and supporting employ-
ees to do what’s right when faced with 
ethical dilemmas. 

In 2021, around 98% of employees 
completed e-training on the Code of 
Ethics. In addition, around 84 000 
employees visited an internal Code of 
Ethics information platform and 
around 65 000 accessed an online 
tool called Decision Explorer that 
provides guidance to help resolve 
ethical dilemmas. We also launched a 
toolkit to support leaders in discuss-
ing ethical dilemmas with their teams. 

We improved the way we manage 
conflicts of interest with the release of 
a revised framework, including a new 
guideline, disclosure process and 
supporting tool. Around 97% of 
employees completed a declaration 
on potential conflicts of interest.

Further, we took steps to integrate an 
ethics dialogue into the process for 
recruiting potential new employees. In 
2021, we launched a guide for inter-
viewers to assess the ethical profile of 
potential hires and their fit with the 
Novartis Values and Behaviors and 
our Code of Ethics. By signaling that 
ethics and integrity matter to Novartis 
during the first interaction with a 
candidate, we improve our chances of 
hiring high-integrity individuals who 
are a good fit for our ethical culture.

In our Code of Ethics, we commit to 
use artificial intelligence in a transpar-

ent and responsible way. In 2021, we 
were one of the first companies to 
issue a position statement on the topic. 
For more information, please see the 
section “Go big on data and digital.”

Advances in digital technology have 
led to new, more personalized ways of 
engaging with our customers across 
multiple channels. To ensure we 
navigate these changes in the external 
environment ethically, we are adjusting 
our Professional Practices Policy and 
processes to create consistency in 
how we manage new relevant types of 
compliance risks. We have rolled out a 
global system architecture to ensure 
our processes are implemented 
consistently across markets. 

Measuring our ethical climate 
We launched our first annual global 
ethics survey in 2021 to measure our 
progress in embedding our Code of 
Ethics across the organization. 
Translated into 15 languages, the 
survey was sent out to 150 000 
Novartis employees and external 
contractors. 

The results from more than 50 000 
responses to the survey provide us 
with robust data across different 
parts of the company to evaluate the 
effectiveness of our policies, pro-
grams and controls. Importantly, they 
also help us identify areas where we 
may need to reinforce our ethical 
culture and climate. We are working 
to turn these insights into processes 
and tools to further encourage 
ethical behavior, and we plan to 
repeat the survey in 2022 to gain 
further insights. 

Novartis participated in a collective 
action initiated by Norges Bank 
Investment Management (NBIM) to 
jointly develop a reporting standard 
on anti-bribery. In early 2022, we 
published our first anti-bribery report 
based on the guidance issued by 
NBIM and aligned with principles such 
as the United Nations (UN) Global 
Compact and the OECD Guidelines 
for Multinational Enterprises. 

Upholding our commitment 
to human rights

We continue to make progress in 
expanding our efforts to respect 
human rights within our operations 
and throughout our supply chain. In 
2021, we published a holistic Human 
Rights Commitment Statement that 
builds on our previous commitments 
and reflects the increasing impor-
tance of integrating human rights 
across the organization.

New measurement framework
In 2021, we took another key step in 
implementing the UN Guiding Princi-
ples on Business and Human Rights 
by developing a measurement frame-
work to track our performance across 
three pillars: due diligence, empower-
ment and external engagement. 

We continued our engagement in five 
priority areas: third-party labor rights, 
diversity and inclusion, clinical trials, 
grievance mechanisms, and anti-brib-
ery and corruption. We also updated 
our list of 12 salient human rights 
issues based on human rights assess-
ments conducted since 2017.

Anti-bribery policies and practices
Our Anti-Bribery Policy states expec-
tations for all employees, and we also 
clearly state our standards in our Code 
of Ethics. Specific principles are set 
out in our Professional Practices 
Policy, while third-party risk is gov-
erned by our Anti-Bribery Third-Party 
Guideline. Our SpeakUp Office 
investigates allegations of misconduct.

Human rights assessment of 
clinical trials
Clinical trials play a critical role in 
medicine development, but they also 
raise significant human rights consid-
erations. In 2021, we completed a 
human rights assessment of the 
global policy framework governing our 
clinical trials. Results showed that we 
are aligned with external expectations 

on human rights, including on informed 
consent, transparency, post-trial 
access to medicine, financial compen-
sation, and potential conflicts of 
interest, among other areas. Please 
see here for a list of relevant policies 
and here for clinical trial results. 

Empowering employees to under-
stand and assess human rights
Through our internal Human Rights 
Ambassador Network, we worked 
with our pharmaceutical export 
business to develop a human rights 
assessment toolkit. We are piloting 
two remote human rights assess-
ments in countries with heightened 
human rights risk. 

Purchasing raw materials from 
certified sources 
Internally, we continued to address 
risks from raw material inputs into our 
medicines, and we are rolling out 
guides to support our procurement 
team in purchasing ingredients from 
certified sources. Externally, through 
the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain 
Initiative’s Human Rights and Labor 
Subcommittee, which Novartis co-
chairs, we continued to investigate 
human rights risks associated with raw 
material inputs in pharmaceutical 
products and to develop approaches 
for collective action in our supply 
chains.

Integrating human rights into our 
third-party risk process 
In 2021, we completed the integration 
of human rights into the four relevant 
risk areas (labor rights; health, safety 
and environment; data privacy; and 
anti-bribery and corruption) in our 
Third-Party Risk Management  
process. This included updating 
our Third-Party Code and self-
assessment questionnaires, as well  
as ongoing training with our third-
party labor rights risk experts.  

Further, we launched a pilot to sup-
port suppliers with higher-risk profiles 
in implementing our Third-Party Code.

Encouraging employees to 
speak up

The Novartis SpeakUp Office, which 
from 2021 has been integrated into 
the Ethics, Risk & Compliance (ERC) 
function, enables employees and 
external parties to raise concerns 
about potential misconduct while 
being protected against retaliation.

In 2021, a total of 2 099 complaints of 
alleged misconduct resulting in 1 932 
cases, with 2 385 allegations, were 
received and handled. Of the com-
plaints, 84% came via the SpeakUp 
channel and the remainder were 
self-identified via existing internal con-
trols. Anonymous complaints were 
33% of the total. We saw a 5% 
increase in SpeakUp complaints in 
2021 compared with 2020, primarily 
due to employees returning to work-
sites as the pandemic situation eased 
in some countries, and due to 
increased training and awareness of 
the program.

Of the total cases, 174 (9%) were 
classified as central matters (higher-
risk cases) warranting further investi-
gation, while 1 758 lower-risk matters 
were addressed or investigated 
locally. The investigated central 
matter allegations resulted in 62 
dismissals or resignations, and in 27 
written warnings. Other remedial 
actions such as training, coaching and 
implementing new controls were also 
used when deemed appropriate.

The shift to new ways of working amid 
the COVID-19 pandemic led to certain 
SpeakUp topics arising more fre-
quently. For instance, we observed an 
increase in complaints regarding 
leadership behaviors amid flexible 
working arrangements, as well as 

those related to company guidelines 
on vaccinations or testing. Such 
complaints typically did not require 
investigation and could be addressed 
through local management or human 
resources teams. Allegations related 
to improper professional practices 
continued to decrease in 2021 due to 
the strengthening of our ERC policy, 
training and monitoring program.

In 2021, we took steps to increase 
awareness about the SpeakUp pro-
gram in certain markets and regions 
through targeted training and aware-
ness sessions. We saw, for instance,  
a 6% increase in misconduct reporting 
in the Europe, Middle East and Africa 
region. 

Commitment to 
transparency and 
disclosure 

Transparent reporting and disclosure 
play a key role in building trust with 
society. Novartis applies and supports 
laws and regulations that promote 
transparency around relationships 
between healthcare companies and 
healthcare professionals, healthcare 
organizations and patient organiza-
tions, and related transfers of value. 
Novartis is keeping pace with these 
developments and is committed to 
meeting new transparency require-
ments. Please see here for further 
details.

For patient organizations, Novartis 
goes beyond the reporting require-
ments set by the EFPIA (European 
Federation of Pharmaceutical Indus-
tries and Associations) Code of 
Practice. We publish a global report 
covering transfers of value made to 
patient organizations in all countries 
where we operate. 

Novartis has supported transparency 
in clinical trials for more than 20 years 
and was one of the first companies to 
commit to publishing trial results of 
innovative medicines within one year 
of study completion, regardless of 
outcome. For more information, please 
see www.novartisclinicaltrials.com.

Being a responsible 
citizen

Our purpose as a global medicines 
company is inherently social, and we 
have a responsibility, together with 
governments and civil society, to 
contribute solutions to big societal 
problems such as climate change and 
antimicrobial resistance. We can help 
drive positive change by harnessing the 
assets that make us successful in the 
first place: people, ideas and capital. 
For information on how we help combat 
the global problem of falsified medi-
cines, please see the section “Embrace 
operational excellence.”

Enhancing environmental 
sustainability

Our commitment to environmental 
sustainability is an important part of 
how we build trust with society and is 
aligned with our purpose. Unless we 
can operate sustainably, our efforts to 
improve and extend people’s lives may 
be compromised by our environmen-
tal impact.  

In 2021, we further strengthened our 
environmental targets by committing 
to become net zero in terms of climate 
emissions across our value chain by 
2040, building on our mid- and 
long-term goals to become carbon 
neutral, plastic neutral and water 
sustainable. More details on our 
performance in 2021 can be found in 
our climate-related financial disclo-
sures (TCFD). Please see our corpo-
rate website for full details of our 
environmental sustainability strategy.

Environmental targets
Our targets to be carbon neutral, plas-
tic neutral and water sustainable are 
the central focus of our environmental 
sustainability strategy. In 2021, we 
reduced greenhouse gas emissions 
by 34% (Scope 1 and Scope 2) versus 
our 2016 baseline, making further 
progress after a 26% reduction in the 
previous year. We reduced water 
consumption by 40%, compared with 
35% in 2020, and reduced waste

used at some locations). For example, 
in the US, all single-use plastic bottles 
in vending machines were replaced by 
recyclable aluminum, glass or biode-
gradable containers.

To reach our emissions targets, we 
are reducing our energy demand and 
accelerating our procurement of 
renewable electricity. We aim to use 
100% renewable electricity in our own 
operations by 2025. In 2021, we signed

value chain will therefore require a 
coordinated approach with our 
suppliers. In 2021, we launched 
Novartis Green Expectations from 
Suppliers, which requires suppliers to 
map out their emissions, water 
consumption and waste footprint 
baselines; understand water quality 
thoroughly; set targets; and report their 
progress. For more on how we 
approach environmental sustainability 
in our manufacturing operations and 
our supply chain, please see the 
section “Embrace operational  
excellence.”

OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2021

In 2021, Novartis laboratories were 
certified by My Green Lab, a third-
party framework that aims to improve 
environmental sustainability in labora-
tory settings. More than 800 Novartis 
researchers across 24 laboratory sites 
in 11 countries took part in the certifica-
tion process.

Novartis sites use water for cleaning 
and cooling purposes, and as a 
solvent. To ensure the effective 
management of water quality, we go 
beyond regulatory requirements and 
ensure that our active pharmaceutical 
ingredients (APIs) are discharged at 
levels that are predicted to not cause 
harm to the environment. 

By 2030, we will expand our current 
water quality scope to include all efflu-
ents from API and finished dosage 
form production within Novartis and 
relevant suppliers, and become water 
neutral. This means ensuring the 
amount of water Novartis withdraws 
from the local environment does not 
contribute to the depletion of local 
water reserves. It entails valuing the 
water needs of stakeholders and the 
ecosystem in an equitable way.

Further details of our progress in the 
area of water quality and quantity are 
included in the CDP Water Security 
Report, the AMR Industry Alliance 
report and the Access to Medicine 
Foundation AMR Benchmark report.

Sustainable medicines
Novartis is committed to embedding 
environmental sustainability into the 
design of new products, devices and 
packaging. We assess the environmen-
tal impact associated with all stages of 
a product’s life, from raw material 
extraction to processing, manufactur-
ing, distribution, use and disposal. In 
2020 and 2021, we conducted pilot 
life-cycle assessment studies for one 
of our respiratory dry powder inhaler 
devices, which showed that on average 
our product has a low carbon footprint 
compared to other products with 
similar published studies. 

We also aim to create a culture where 
sustainability is embedded in the

1  Other than where indicated, environmental data for the current year are based on actuals for 
January-September and estimates for October-December (to be updated with actuals in H2 
2022 in our annual Novartis Environmental Sustainability and Occupational Health and Safety 
Data Supplement). Any significant deviations are restated the following year in the Novartis in 
Society Integrated Report. Previous years’ data reflect only actuals.

2  2021 data includes indirect emissions from air travel, train travel, car rentals and hotel stays. 
The methodology changed in 2021, with previous years’ data covering emissions from air 
travel only. This is part of a calculation effort to expand the Scope 3 category 6 emission 
activities reported and part of a wider Scope 3 calculation review that aims to increase the 
coverage to more than 90% of the overall Scope 3. New to 2021, air travel emissions now also 
cover radiative forcing, which multiplies the indirect emissions by 1.9. The published metric 
represents actual data from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, which was made 
available on January 5, 2022. This data may be updated after the reporting date as emissions 
are calculated based on bookings, which may be adjusted after the reporting period. For 
further Scope 3 disclosures, please see our latest HSE supplement.

4  GHG offsets are based on data provided by third parties. The Santo Domingo forest carbon 

offset project in Argentina is due to reach maturity; as projects near this phase, routine 
operations involve thinning and harvesting. These operations have generated the negative 
GHG emissions offset value for 2021. The Santo Domingo offsets are based on January-June 
actual data and July-December estimates, while offsets from our Hacienda El Manatial project 
in Colombia are based on January-September actual data and October-December estimates 
(to be revised with actuals in Q1 2022). The methodology we use to measure offsets will be 
reviewed in 2022.

Our AMR approach

We take a balanced, cross-secto-
rial approach to combating AMR.

Prevention
•  Responsible manufacturing to help reduce 
the environmental impact of the production 
of antibiotics

•  Manufacturing site in Austria is hub of last 
vertically integrated antibiotic production 
chain in Europe

Access
•  Strengthening high-quality, affordable 

antibiotics portfolio

•  Adaptable portfolio for tailored AMR 

response

•  Pediatric-specific formulations

•  Stable formulations for LMICs

Responsible use
•  Balancing access efforts with global and 
local initiatives to ensure prescription of 
the right drug at the right dose for the right 
duration

•  New tools and technological solutions for 
advocacy, surveillance, diagnostics and 
education

•  Healthcare professional/patient education, 
user-friendly packs, awareness campaigns, 
safe drug disposal

Innovation and adaptive 
development
•  Focusing on areas where we can really make 

a difference

•  AMR Action Fund 

decision-making process. To this end, 
in 2021 we established a Green 
Ambassadors Network to communi-
cate, sponsor and share sustainability 
initiatives between local and global 
teams. We also established a global 
network of colleagues collaborating 
on sustainability projects, and we 
offered new training modules to all 
employees on our environmental 
sustainability strategy. 

Advancing our program 
to combat antimicrobial 
resistance 

The WHO has declared antimicrobial 
resistance (AMR) – when antibiotics 
and other antimicrobial medicines 
become ineffective and infections 
become increasingly difficult or 
impossible to treat – as one of the 
major public health threats facing 
humanity. 

Novartis supports the global scientific 
consensus that overuse, underuse 
and misuse of antimicrobial medicines 
all contribute to the spread of AMR, 
and that a balanced approach encom-
passing prevention, stewardship, 
access and innovation is needed. 

Responsible manufacturing is a 
central part of our efforts. This 
includes minimizing antibiotic residues 
– especially into water bodies – and 
reducing waste. Please see the 
section “Enhancing environmental 
sustainability” for more information.

We also continue to invest in new 
antibiotic manufacturing facilities. In 
2021, our Sandoz Division – which is 
the world’s largest volume provider of 
generic antibiotics – confirmed it 
would invest more than EUR 100 
million in new manufacturing technol-
ogy at its Kundl site in Austria, the hub 
of the only remaining end-to-end 
antibiotic manufacturing network in 
Europe. Sandoz also announced a 
EUR 50 million investment in new 
production technology and increased 
manufacturing capacity at its Palafolls 
site in Spain. 

Education on responsible use is key to 
tackling AMR. We embarked on a 
program with MedShr to train health-
care professionals on antimicrobial 
resistance, reaching 250 000 individ-
uals through 33 000 engagements. 
AMR education is a key feature of our 
partnerships with Save the Children in 
Kenya and with the Commonwealth 
Pharmacists Association across SSA. 
We also engage with communities 
directly in rural areas of Africa and 
India as part of our Healthy Family 
program, including on water rehabili-
tation projects in Kenya and India.

We embarked on a program 
with MedShr to train health-
care professionals on 
antimicrobial resistance, 
reaching 250 000 indivi duals 
through 33 000 engagement

In addition, we contribute to multi-
stakeholder solutions to combat AMR. 
For instance, through STELLA and 
Bio-Campus, we are developing 
solutions for enhanced AMR surveil-
lance and recommendations for 
improved treatment guidelines to 
mitigate the risk of resistance. As a 
member of the AMR Industry Alliance, 
we are working with peer companies 
to roll out voluntary standards for 
responsible manufacturing, and with 
the Responsible Antibiotics Manufac-
turing Platform (RAMP) on responsi-
ble antibiotic manufacturing. We also 
extended our collaboration with Ares 
Genetics to further leverage molecu-
lar predictive antibiotic susceptibility 
testing to support physicians in 
selecting appropriate antibiotic 
therapies.

We support innovation and adaptive 
development in antibiotics. For 
example, Novartis is an investor in the 
AMR Action Fund together with other 
pharmaceutical companies, philan-
thropic organizations and develop-
ment banks. The initiative aims to 
bring two to four new antibiotics to 
patients by 2030.

Antimicrobial  
Resistance Benchmark
improving our ranking by  
one place since 2020

Responding to the call from UNICEF 
to combat childhood pneumonia, 
Sandoz developed pediatric amoxicil-
lin, today recommended by the WHO 
as first-line treatment for childhood 
pneumonia. 

Novartis was ranked fourth in the 
2021 Antimicrobial Resistance 
Benchmark (from fifth in 2020), which 
evaluates the performance of the 
world’s 17 largest pharmaceutical 
companies in the fight against AMR. 
We are recognized for performing 
strongly in the areas of responsible 
manufacturing, appropriate access 
and stewardship. 

Conducting animal 
research responsibly

Novartis is committed to using alter-
natives to animal research wherever 
feasible. Our global policy and stand-
ards define key principles, responsibil-
ities and requirements governing 
animal research. All studies spon-
sored by Novartis, whether conducted 
internally or externally, must adhere to 
our policy and standards. 

In 2021, all Novartis Institutes for 
BioMedical Research in-vivo research 
sites received accreditation from the 
Association for Assessment and 
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal 
Care International, underscoring our 
progress in conducting responsible 
animal research.

We adhere to the 3R principles: 
reduce the number of animals in 
studies, refine study methods to 
improve the animal’s experience, and 
replace animal studies with alternative 
options. In 2021, for example, 
researchers across three disease 
areas joined forces to profile neuroin-
flammation pathways in a model for 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
reducing the number of animals 
needed for study by 86%.

Similarly, researchers reduced the 
number of animals needed for a 
chimeric antigen receptor T-cell 
(CAR-T) study by developing a 
non-invasive method for measuring 
anti-tumor activity in the same animals 
over time. We also replaced the use of 
animals in a training program on key 
principles of surgery by deploying a 
new digital training platform.

Our corporate governance 
framework 
Our system of corporate governance 
is based on effective checks and 
balances. We have a three-tier 
structure: the Annual General Meeting 
of Shareholders (AGM), our Board of 
Directors, and the Executive Commit-
tee of Novartis (ECN):

• Shareholders approve the compa-

ny’s financial statements and other 
disclosures, as well as compensation 
for members of our Board and ECN. 
They also approve the dividend and 
elect the company’s Chairman, 
Board members, Compensation 
Committee members, Independent 
Proxy and external auditor.

• Our Board of Directors holds the 

company’s ultimate decision-making 
authority, with the exception of 
decisions reserved for shareholders. 
The Board represents the interests 
of all stakeholders. The Board 
operates through five committees: 
Audit and Compliance; Compensa-
tion; Governance, Nomination and 
Corporate Responsibilities; Risk; and 
Science & Technology. 

• The ECN, which reports to the Board 
and is led by the CEO, is responsible 
for operational management, includ-
ing achieving the company’s financial 
and strategic objectives. 

The external auditor provides their 
opinion on the compliance of Novartis 
Group consolidated statements and 
other financial information, the 
Compensation Report, internal 
controls over financial reporting, and 
sustainability reporting with applica-
ble standards and laws. 

Board of Novartis
All members of the Board, including 
the Chairman, are independent and 
non-executive, as defined by our 
corporate governance rules. When 
choosing Board members, we aim for a 
balance of skills, expertise and experi-
ence. We believe a diverse Board, 

including in gender, age, nationality 
and ethnicity, supports long-term value 
creation. Most of our Board members 
have experience in leadership or 
management positions; half have direct 
experience in the healthcare or 
pharmaceutical industry. 

Members of the Board are elected for 
one-year terms and may serve a 
maximum of 12 years; this term limit 
was approved by shareholders in 2021. 
The Board is subject to an annual 
assessment, which is carried out by an 
external consultant in every third year. 

Board members also have regular 
training sessions. In 2021, these mostly 
virtual sessions included training on 
diversity and inclusion, our ethical 
commitments and our Professional 
Practices Policy, as well as insider 
trading, data privacy, and digital 
engagement for personal use. Please 
see page 91 for Board highlights in 
2021.

Executive Committee of Novartis
The Board appoints the ECN mem-
bers and delegates to them the overall 
responsibility for and oversight of the 
operational management of Novartis. 
The ECN currently has 12 members 
and is led by the CEO (see next page 
for details).

Novartis AG 
and Novartis shares
Novartis AG, the Group’s holding 
company, is a corporation organized 
under Swiss law with its registered 
office in Basel, Switzerland. Novartis 
shares are listed on the SIX Swiss 
Exchange (symbol: NOVN) and the 
New York Stock Exchange (symbol: 
NVS). The latter are in the form of 
American depositary receipts repre-
senting Novartis American depositary 
shares.

Shareholder rights
Shareholders have the right to vote 
and to execute all other rights as 
granted under Swiss law and the 
Articles of Incorporation. All shares 
have equal voting rights and carry 

equal entitlements to dividends. 
The AGM usually takes place in late 
February or early March. Normally, 
shareholders can vote their shares by 
themselves or appoint another 
shareholder or the Independent Proxy 
to vote on their behalf. However, in 
accordance with Swiss legislation 
passed in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, it was not possible to 
physically attend our 2021 AGM, and 
shareholders could exercise their 
voting rights only through the Inde-
pendent Proxy.

ESG governance
The Governance, Nomination and 
Corporate Responsibilities Committee 
(GNCRC) regularly reviews corporate 
governance principles and key 
governance documents against 
evolving best practice standards and 
new developments. 

The ECN-level Trust & Reputation 
Committee, chaired by the CEO, 
meets every two months to oversee 
the company’s environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) performance. 
In addition, we have an ESG Manage-
ment Office to further embed ESG 
priorities across our business.

Stakeholder engagement is key to our 
ESG approach. We engage with our 
stakeholders through regular meet-
ings, conferences and seminars; this 
engagement is a key part of building 
trust with society. For shareholders, 
we organize ESG investor days and 
issue a quarterly progress update. For 
more information, please see page 12. 

In addition, we work through external 
initiatives on important health, indus-
try and social issues. Please see 
“External initiatives and memberships 
of associations” in the appendix of 
this report. 

Board highlights for 2021

During 2021, the Board of Directors 
met nine times, including both regular 
and ad hoc meetings. In response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board 
held virtual, hybrid and physical 
meetings, with participants joining in 
person when possible. In their discus-
sions, the Board and committees 
covered a number of issues, including: 

{  Progress with the company’s stra te gy, 

including therapeutic areas and 
technology platforms, key geographic 
areas and the generics business

{  Review of larger strategic considerations 

to drive sustainable growth, such as 
mergers and acquisitions

{  Review of the Novartis ESG strategy

{  A key strategy review for the US and 

China markets

{  Longer-term Board succession planning 
and required profiles, including propo-
sing one new Board member candidate 
to be elected at the 2022 AGM

{  How Novartis is prepared to respond to 

cybersecurity incidents

{  The annual Board self-evaluation 

{  Discussion and approved the divestment 
of the Company’s investment in Roche 
Holding AG 

{  Initiation of a strategic review of Sandoz

Ethics, risk and compliance

We have an extensive ethics, risk and 
compliance approach, comprising:

Ethics

Risk

Compliance

•  Ethics (including our Code of Ethics)
•  Human rights
•  Ethical culture and impact

•  Enterprise risk and crisis management
•  Enterprise policy and control 

 management

•  Third-party risk management 
•  Health, safety and environment (HSE) 

governance

•  Compliance management system
•  SpeakUp Office (our whistleblower program)
•  Centralized team for monitoring  

and remediation

This approach is overseen by our 
Ethics, Risk & Compliance (ERC) 
function; it ensures clear alignment 
between risk management, policies 
and controls. We have specific internal 
policies in place in areas such as data 
privacy, non-discrimination, anti-brib-
ery, human rights and HSE, which help 
us maintain high standards of ethics 
and integrity across our business.  

Risk management
The Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) process at Novartis is a series 
of coordinated activities designed to 
identify risks, promote accountability 
and support balanced decision-mak-
ing. Our objective is to prevent or 
minimize risks that may affect our 
business, while ensuring that we can 
still capture opportunities for growth.

Central to our approach is the 
Novartis Code of Ethics, which 
comprises 23 commitments on topics 
such as human rights, drug safety, 
data use, and access to medicines. 
The code guides employees in daily 
decision-making and provides an 
ethical framework to our risk manage-
ment approach. For more information 
on how we embed our Code of Ethics 
across the organization, see page 80.

Many of our policies and controls are 
based on international norms and 
standards, including the United 
Nations Global Compact, the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enter-
prises, and standards published by 
the International Labor Organization. 
We regard ethics, compliance and 
good risk management as crucial to 
maintaining public trust.

Our objective is to prevent 
or minimize risks that may 
affect our business, while 
ensuring that we can still 
capture opportunities for 
growth

Regular workshops are held across 
the company to identify risks and 
possible mitigation measures. These 
are consolidated into the Novartis 
Risk Compass, which provides an 
overview of strategic, operational and 
emerging risks for use by senior 
management (see page 22). 

The Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance 
Officer is responsible for the overall 
risk management process at Novartis. 

The ERC function oversees the 
company’s risk management and 
compliance functions, including 
risk-based companywide policy and 
internal control management, as well 
as crisis and business continuity 
management. The ECN, led by the 
CEO, reviews and endorses the risk 
portfolio. 

The Board of Directors provides the 
highest layer of oversight. It focuses 
on the most significant risks, while the 
Board-level Risk Committee reviews 
the entire risk portfolio and actions 
implemented by management. For 
further details on the Risk Committee 
and its activities, please see page 142 
of our 2021 Annual Report.

In 2021, we integrated global gover-
nance of our HSE activities within 
ERC, merging it with our Business 
Continuity Management and Novartis 
Emergency Management teams to 
create a new function called Global 
HSE & Resilience. The goal is to 
reduce risks, increase resilience and 
generate further positive impact on 
our people, patients and planet.

Compliance
As part of our ERC approach, we have 
a comprehensive compliance man-
agement system to detect and 
prevent systemic misconduct. This 
system covers five principal risk 
areas: ethical dilemmas, bribery and 
corruption, third-party misconduct, 
professional practices, and conflicts  
of interest. Within our ERC function, 
we have a team responsible for 
monitoring compliance and taking 
action to address any misconduct 
with internal units and third parties. 

In 2021, the Novartis SpeakUp Office, 
which enables employees and exter-
nal parties to raise concerns about 
potential misconduct while being 
protected against retaliation, was 
integrated into the ERC function to 
further align our efforts and embed 
our Code of Ethics across the organi-
zation (see page 82).

Internal Audit

Internal Audit assists the Board of 
Directors and the ECN in discharging 
their governance responsibilities by 
providing independent assurance and 
advice on the effectiveness, efficiency 
and adequacy of processes and 
controls that support Novartis in 
achieving its objectives, managing its 
major risks, and ensuring compliance 
with applicable policies, laws and 
regulations. The Internal Audit func-
tion executes the risk-based annual 
audit plan approved by the Board-
level Audit and Compliance Commit-
tee (ACC) and reports the results to 
the audited units, the ECN and the 
ACC.

In 2021, our Internal Audit function 
carried out a total of 46 audits, ten 
internal reviews and 14 advisories – 
most conducted remotely due to the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These 
engagements covered the entire value 
chain of Novartis and key strategic 
and operational risks. 

Internal Audit is part of Novartis 
Business Assurance & Advisory 
(NBAA), an independent function that 
also comprises the Global Security 
function with its four pillars: falsified 
medicines, investigation, intelligence 
and executive protection. NBAA plays 
an important role in supporting the 
risk and compliance process, and 
provides protection, insight and 
advice to the business and the ACC.

Compensation Report 
summary

In 2021, we continued our transformation into a leading, focused medicines company 
powered by technology, leadership in research and development, world-class commer-
cialization, global access and data science. Feedback from shareholder engagement 
prior to our last Annual General Meeting (AGM) suggested that shareholders were in 
agreement that our current compensation system is aligned with the company’s 
purpose, strategy and culture. No major changes are therefore proposed for 2022.

2021 changes to 
compensation system and 
disclosures

The year completes the first three-year 
performance cycle of the new Long-
Term Performance Plan (LTPP), follow-
ing the combination of the previous 
LTPP and the Long-Term Relative 
Performance Plan (LTRPP), as commu-
nicated in our 2018 Compensation 
Report. The combined plan focuses on 
four equally weighted performance 
metrics: net sales compound annual 
growth rate (CAGR), core operating 
income CAGR, innovation, and relative 
total shareholder return (TSR).

In 2021, we reviewed our Compensa-
tion Report format with a view to 
increase its accessibility while maintain-
ing its depth of disclosure. We chose to 
develop our “compensation at a glance” 
section to incorporate a more graphical 
illustration of the 2021 CEO pay 
outcomes and a summary of our 
executive compensation framework for 
2022. In addition, we provide further 
visibility into the 2019-2021 LTPP 
targets, showing the threshold, target 
and maximum opportunity for each 
performance metric.

2021 performance 
highlights

2021 was a year of solid performance, 
with growth across sales, profits, 
margins and cash flow. Sales growth 
drivers were Entresto (USD 3.5 billion), 
Cosentyx (USD 4.7 billion), and 
Zolgensma (USD 1.4 billion), along with 
therapies like Kesimpta, Promacta/

Revolade, Kisqali and Jakavi. While 
overall sales performance was on 
target, COVID-19 continued to impact 
parts of our business, specifically 
Oncology and Sandoz.

We continued to deliver innovation to 
patients in 2021 with 21 approvals, 
including Leqvio (US, EU) and Scem-
blix (US), and 34 submissions made 
across our top four markets. However, 
the year was not without setbacks, as 
some clinical trials of experimental 
compounds – including Kymriah for 
blood cancer, ACZ885 (canakinumab) 
for lung cancer, and CFZ533 
(iscalimab) in kidney transplant 
patients – did not meet their primary 
goals.

We progressed our efforts to deliver 
next-generation medicines while 
driving our environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) agenda. Pursuing 
new health equity initiatives in clinical 
trial diversity, advancing access to 
medicines, and using data and digital 
technologies in underserved regions 
in Africa, South America and Asia are 
examples of our long-term commit-
ment to transform global health. More 
details on our ESG efforts are pro-
vided earlier in this report.

Performance against the incentive tar-
gets, combined with base salary and 
other benefits, pension, Alcon Keep 
Whole awards and dividend equiva-
lents, resulted in 2021 total realized 
compensation for the CEO of CHF 
11 224 727. This is a reduction of 11.8% 
compared to 2020. Overall, while the 
financial and operational targets were 
met or surpassed, some of the 
innovation targets were missed, which 

led to a reduction in long-term growth 
potential. This is reflected in a TSR 
performance below the peer group 
median. The reduced contribution of 
innovation and relative TSR to the 
2019-2021 LTPP cycle were the main 
drivers of the lower total realized com-
pensation in 2021 versus 2020. Full 
details of the 2019-2021 LTPP perfor-
mance can be found in the Compen-
sation Report of our 2021 Annual 
Report.

Alignment with company 
strategy

Our strategy is to build a focused 
medicines company powered by 
technology, leadership in research and 
development, world-class commercial-
ization, global access and data science. 
We foster a company culture that is 
inspired, curious and unbossed. We 
believe these elements drive continued 
innovation and will support the creation 
of value over the long term for our 
company, society and shareholders. To 
continue to align the compensation 
system with this strategy and to ensure 
that Novartis is a high-performing 
organization, the company operates 
both a short-term Annual Incentive 
plan and a Long-Term Incentive (LTI) 
plan with a balanced set of measures 
and targets. The Board of Directors 
determines specific, measurable and 
time-bound performance measures 
for the Annual Incentive and LTI plans. 
The Compensation Committee has 
reviewed the existing compensation 
system and determined that it contin-
ues to support our strategy.

task Force on Climate-related Financial 
disclosures (tCFd)

Novartis committed in 2020 to fully support the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclo-
sures (TCFD) and included a qualitative disclosure in the Novartis in Society Report that year. This is our first quantitative 
TCFD disclosure, building on our qualitative disclosure and responses to the CDP climate questionnaire in previous years. 
We aim to provide iterative qualitative and quantitative disclosures on climate-related topics on a recurring basis as we 
incorporate the TCFD recommendations into our business, enterprise risk management and strategy development and 
become more mature in how we create actionable information on climate risks and opportunities.

Governance

board oversight
The Governance, Nomination and Corporate Responsibilities Committee of the Novartis Board of Directors receives regu-
lar updates on climate risks and opportunities as part of its oversight of environmental, social and governance (ESG) top-
ics. These are scheduled as written updates semi-annually, with verbal updates in alternating quarters.

Management oversight
Under the leadership of the CEO, the Executive Committee of Novartis (ECN) is responsible for approving the environmen-
tal sustainability strategy of Novartis, including climate, water, and waste targets. The Chief Sustainability Officer provides 
an annually updated climate scenario analysis, and information on physical and transition risks and opportunities to the 
ECN. The Trust & Reputation Committee, chaired by the CEO, meets every two months to assess progress as part of a 
quarterly ESG scorecard submission process. It also updates the ECN and the Board on progress and challenges. 

Novartis launched a new environmental sustainability strategy in 2021. Per the revised governance, under the leadership 
of the Chief Sustainability Officer, the Environmental Sustainability Office will provide the leadership, subject matter exper-
tise and portfolio management support that will support the implementation of our strategy. The primary steering commit-
tee for this strategy is the Environmental Sustainability Strategy Implementation Steering Committee (ESSI), while the Trust 
& Reputation Committee will continue to oversee its delivery.

RELEVANT DISCLOSURES:

tCFd recommendations (governance)

a) Describe the board’s oversight of climate-related risks and 
opportunities.

Refer to CDP question C1.1b.

b) Describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate-
related risks and opportunities.

Refer to CDP questions C1.2 and C1.2a.

Strategy

Climate change will have a major impact on our business, including our operations, strategy, financial planning and value 
chain, as well as on stakeholders such as patients. For example, climate change is already causing extreme heat and poor 
air quality in some areas, which threatens to exacerbate pre-existing health conditions such as heart failure, lung cancer and 
respiratory diseases. In addition, an increase in temperature and humidity may cause a proliferation of insects that carry vec-
tor-borne diseases, including dengue fever, malaria, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. Novartis is working to understand 
and anticipate these risks to ensure we can continue to discover, develop and deliver life-saving medicines.

Novartis has been active in integrating climate and environmental considerations into our financial planning. For example, 
we apply a threshold of USD 20 million for capital expenditure projects requiring an environmental sustainability review. We 
also operate with a USD 100 per ton shadow carbon price to help inform our strategic decision-making and budget plan-
ning with respect to carbon impacts. In 2020 and 2021, climate change met the financial materiality threshold for inclusion 
in our core Annual Report and in our ERM process as part of a broader strategic risk focused on ESG topics.  

Processes
Novartis conducted a long-term sensitivity and stress-testing analysis for climate and water in collaboration with the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change as the first-generation 
climate risk analysis. The analysis was based on a scenario that aligns to the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 
6.0 model for temperature change, which assumes that climate policy remains constant in the wake of the Paris Accord 
after 2030, and that significant technology advancements in low-carbon emissions technologies take time to scale. The 
scenario analysis was a multiphase project which included a detailed climate risk analysis of a key site, as well as an initial 

global assessment of 70 sites that are critical for the production and research parts of the company. The scenarios used 
2030, 2050 and 2070 as timelines.

During 2021, Novartis initiated a second round of climate scenario analysis to define physical and transition risks across its 
operations and supply chain. The physical risk analysis was based on a comparison of outcomes aligned to RCP 4.5 and 
RCP 8.5 over two timeframes (2030 and 2050). Physical risk was assessed at 21 sites to include business-critical opera-
tions sites, major research and development locations, and other major support sites. The transition risk analysis related 
to the transition to a low-carbon economy was based on a 1.5-degree outcome and a 3.0-degree outcome, and was run 
over four timeframes (2025, 2030, 2040 and 2050). Initial risks and opportunities were assessed at the enterprise level. 

The ongoing climate scenario analysis is being coordinated with Novartis employees in production, procurement, facilities, 
finance, risk and business continuity, with the aim of supporting the existing ERM process as well as business decisions in 
areas such as utilities procurement, physical adaptation, and potential future changes in therapeutic research and devel-
opment.

In 2020 and into 2021, we conducted a further analysis with MIT of water scarcity risks in three critical water basins in 
China, Europe and South Africa. The analysis is being used to plan for investments in water stewardship and to achieve our 
water neutrality target.

Progress
The following Novartis accomplishments in 2021 are relevant to the TCFD recommendations:
•  Novartis conducted environmental life cycle analysis (LCA) pilot studies for its respiratory dry powder inhaler (DPI) 

devices across six environmental categories in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol’s sector 
guidance for pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The study suggested that the Novartis DPIs have, on average, a 
carbon footprint of less than half compared to other published DPI LCAs – with classical pressurized metered dose 
inhalers (pMDIs) using HFC-134a as propellant gas displaying an average carbon footprint of up to 50 times higher 
than the Novartis DPI. Including carbon impact and pricing into early-stage development of drugs can drive investment 
optimization and reduce carbon emissions during the scale-up of new products.

•  Following the success of DPI devices, we launched a new sustainability study on Coartem to make it our next and our 

first large-scale carbon-neutral project.

•  We reached the milestone of 1 billion treatments of our artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) delivered since 

1999, with more than 90% supplied without profit. More than 450 million were a pediatric formulation developed jointly 
with Medicines for Malaria Venture. The World Health Organization estimates that adopting ACTs as a first-line 
treatment for malaria, together with prevention efforts and better diagnostics, have saved 7.6 million lives since 2000.
•  Construction started for new generation capacity as part of our pan-European virtual power purchase agreement. It 
will deliver 100% renewable electricity and carbon neutrality for procured electricity in Novartis European operations 
by 2022 through newly built solar and wind projects in Spain.

•  Novartis partnered with One Young World to organize and sponsor Operation Planetary Health to raise awareness 

about environmental sustainability and to create a movement to accelerate change within the organization. The theme 
of “planetary health” aligned with and built on Novartis environmental sustainability targets and strategy. The event 
aimed to inspire employees to address specific environmental challenges with actionable and sustainable solutions. 
Our focus was on carbon neutrality (Scope 3 emissions; emissions in our value/supply chain) and the circular economy. 
We also sought to gain insights and solutions for emerging issues that do not yet form part of our company targets.
•  We developed the Novartis Green Expectations from Suppliers document to outline what is needed from our suppliers 

and support them on that journey. Using the ACCA model, we track and measure suppliers’ journey toward carbon 
neutrality. The four-stage ACCA framework involves:

1.  Awareness building 
2.  Comprehension of the requirements of the carbon emission targets 
3.  Commitment to achieve carbon neutrality 
4.  Definition of action plans to meet environmental sustainability targets

•  The Green Expectations framework was issued to 43 suppliers in 2021. Our Green Supplier Summit complemented the 

Green Expectations initiative, with 88% of participating suppliers acknowledging receipt. We are engaging our 
suppliers in dialogue, and this will be underpinned with concrete tools and mechanisms to facilitate their journey as 
much as possible. The breadth of this engagement – approximately 36 000 suppliers – means the process needs time 
to yield significant results, particularly among suppliers with whom we do not have direct interaction.

•  In 2021, Novartis joined the 100-plus company EV100 initiative, demonstrating our commitment to transition our fleet to 

electric vehicles (EVs). Novartis plans to reduce vehicle fleet emissions by over 63% by 2025, and 94% by 2030. In 
2021, implementation began in 30 countries, impacting 18,000 of 26,000 vehicles in the Novartis fleet.

•  We also joined RE100 in 2021, a global initiative bringing together the world’s most influential businesses committed to 

100% renewable electricity. Our power purchase agreements with renewable power developers, both existing and in the 
commissioning phase, are a key vehicle to us achieving our target 100% renewable energy in the US, Canadian and 
European markets by 2023. 

•  We made further progress in reducing our emissions: Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased by 34% in 2021 versus the 

2016 baseline.

•  In 2021, business travel was 85% less when compared to 2019. While this was largely due to COVID-19 restrictions, 
internal processes have been adapted to maximize virtual meeting technology and dramatically reduce future travel 
even as pandemic restrictions are relaxed in the future.

•  Scope 3 data accuracy has been enhanced in terms of extent and method of calculation. This has resulted in higher 

2019 emissions and a revision of the 2016 baseline. A more robust tracking system is in place to enable comparability 
of calculations and data across years. Currently, we can account for over 90% of our Scope 3 emissions.

•  New manufacturing technologies have been implemented and utility equipment has been upgraded to improve process 

efficiencies. These updates include continuous manufacturing, biocatalysts and high-intensity perfusion batches. 
•  In 2021, Novartis identified 59 locations as being situated in regions that are either currently water-stressed or will be 
classified as such in the coming years. Seven of these locations are currently deemed high-risk. We will work with 
these locations to minimize their water consumption, and we aim to achieve neutrality by ensuring that an equivalent of 
water that cannot be avoided is returned to the same watershed.

•  In 2021, Novartis supported the development of a watershed project in the Telangana, India, region that will address 

the long-term challenge of water availability in water-stressed areas. The goal is to help local communities in the long 
run by increasing water availability, providing additional and safe drinking water, supporting agricultural best practice, 
building personal hygiene structures for schoolchildren, and contributing to the local ecosystems. This will serve as a 
pilot to also examine how Novartis can most successfully contribute to water security in water-stressed regions of the 
world where we may have water-intense production operations.

Refer to CDP questions C3.2, C3.2a and C3.4.

Risk management

Novartis integrates risk and strategy issues in a cross-functional ERM process. All risks are consolidated in a framework called 
the Novartis Risk Compass, which enables senior management, the ECN and the Novartis Board of Directors to focus on key 
risks and to align the company strategy to our risk exposure. For more information on how we identify, assess and manage 
our risks, please see pages 22-25. 

Novartis is potentially exposed to physical risks from varying extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, 
or any other event that may result from the impact of climate change on the environment. For example, some of our pro-
duction facilities are located in places that, because of increasingly violent weather events, sea level rise, or both, are at a 
progressively higher risk of substantial flooding. Other facilities that depend on the availability of water for manufacturing 
processes may be impacted by water scarcity.

During 2021, Novartis initiated a second round of climate scenario analysis to define physical and transition risks across its 
operations and supply chain. All of the detailed calculations were provided by an expert third party, Environmental Resources 
Management, using initial data collection. Knowing that this is an iterative process and that both data granularity and under-
standing of company-specific risks will increase over time, Environmental Resources Management and Novartis have esti-
mated risk exposure and management costs associated with these limited initial risks as:

risk a
Novartis operates globally, and we have significant financial exposure to carbon pricing due to the carbon footprint of our 
production facilities. Our sites in Kundl (Austria), Lendava (Slovenia), Menges (Slovenia) and Ringaskiddy (Ireland)  are all 
subject to the EU’s carbon pricing mechanism (EU ETS), while our site in Grimsby (UK) is subject, as of 2021, to the UK ETS, 
which closely tracks the EU ETS. The benchmark price for EU carbon allowances has been on an upward trajectory for the 
most part of the past few years, rising from EUR 5 a ton in 2017 to over EUR 80 a ton in 2021. We estimate potential expo-
sure in a possible range of USD 19 million to USD 150.9 million related to the carbon price in 2030, according to our best 
current knowledge. Please note that the quantification of our exposure was realized by  Environmental Resources Manage-
ment and that these numbers might change significantly in the future.

risk b
Novartis is exposed to physical risks from climate change, both chronic and acute. The most common types of global risk 
events are heat events, wildfires, water stress/scarcity, cyclones and flooding from sea level rise or severe weather events. 
Our exposure to physical risk due to flooding and cyclones was estimated using scenario analysis based on Representa-
tive Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5, which represent a best case and a worst case scenario of potential dis-
ruption to Novartis operations. Reasonable best and worst risk exposures in 2030 range from USD 80 million to USD 112 
million, and in 2050 range from USD 151 million to USD 163 million. Please note that the quantification of our exposure was 
realized by Environmental Resources Management and that these numbers might change significantly in the future.

risk C
Forty-nine nations have announced that they will decarbonize their healthcare systems, requiring Novartis to also reduce 
its carbon footprint to align with national healthcare sector decarbonization targets, and maintain its competitive position 
in order to have continued opportunities to sell medicines in these markets. The current revenue generated in these mar-
kets is USD 27.5 billion. This is also an opportunity, as success in decarbonizing ahead of our competitors may open up 
more opportunities for revenue in these markets. Potential exposure is USD 27.5 billion if Novartis products are not net zero 
by country-specific deadlines leading up to 2050. Please note that the quantification of our exposure was realized by Envi-
ronmental Resources Management and that these numbers might change significantly in the future.

Further work is already underway and will be completed in 2022 to provide greater clarity on physical and transition risks 
upstream and downstream in our supply chain, and on risks to our core business related to loss of biodiversity and the bur-
geoning impact of climate change on human health.

Metrics and targets

•  Novartis has a goal to be carbon neutral in our own operations by 2025.

independent assurance report 
on the 2021 Novartis in society  
integrated report

To the Board of Directors of Novartis AG, Basel

We have been engaged by the Board of Directors of Novartis AG to perform assurance procedures to provide limited 
 assurance on the ESG performance indicators included within the 2021 Novartis in Society Integrated Report of Novartis 
AG and its consolidated subsidiaries (Novartis Group) for the period ended December 31, 2021.

sCoPe aNd sUbjeCt Matter
Our limited assurance engagement focused on the following 2021 ESG performance indicators, data and information dis-
closed in the Novartis in Society Integrated Report 2021 of the Novartis Group for the year ended December 31, 2021:
•  The “Supply chain performance indicators” on page 52, the “People performance indicators” on page 66 (excluding those 
metrics listed below), the “Access to healthcare performance indicators” on page 72, the “Patients reached with emerg-
ing market brands” on page 73, the “Donations” on page 75, the “Patients reached through support programs” on page 
75, the “Ethical business practices performance indicators” on page 81, and the “Environmental performance indicators” 
on page 84. 

•  The materiality determination and stakeholder engagement process of Novartis at the Group level according to the require-
ments of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards), published by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
and disclosed in the “Global Materiality Assessment 2021 Results Report” linked on page 13 and as applied to the Novartis 
in Society Integrated Report 2021.

•  Reporting processes and related controls in relation to data aggregation of the select ESG indicators.

The following ESG “People performance indicators” on page 66 are not subject to this Assurance Report. Consequently, 
we do not express any conclusion on these ESG performance indicators. 
•  The following indicators within the subheading “Health and safety”:

-  The “Fatalities”

•  The following indicators within the subheading “Gender indicators”:

-  The “Median tenure in years: female/male”

•  The following indicators within the subheading “Gender representation (% female / % male)”:

-  The “Overall headcount”
-  The “Promotions”
-  The “Overall turnover”
-  The “Entry-level positions (job levels 6,7,8)”
-  The “Revenue-producing roles”
-  The “IT roles (IT job family)”
-  The “Engineering roles (R&D + TechOps job families)”

•  All indicators within the subheading “Gender representation by contract type (female/male)”
•  All indicators within the subheading “Number of employees by region, by contract type (permanent/temporary)”

Criteria
The ESG performance indicators disclosed within the Novartis in Society Integrated Report 2021 were prepared by the 
Board of Directors of Novartis AG (the ‘company’) based on the following criteria:
•  GRI Standards
•  Novartis Corporate Responsibility Guideline 
•  Novartis Code of Ethics
•  Novartis procedures for gathering, collecting, and aggregating data for the ESG performance indicators
•  The terms and conditions as outlined within the “Final Listing Prospectus dated 21 September 2020” for the “Patients 
reached with strategic innovative therapies” and “Patients reached through flagship programs” ESG performance  indicators

board oF direCtors’ resPoNsibiLity
The Board of Directors of the company is responsible for preparing the Novartis in Society Integrated Report in accord-
ance with the applicable criteria. This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of the internal 
control system related to the preparation of the Novartis in Society Integrated Report that are free from material misstate-
ment, whether due to fraud or error. Furthermore, the Board of Directors is responsible for the selection and application of 
the criteria and adequate record keeping.

iNdePeNdeNCe aNd QUaLity CoNtroL
We have complied with the independence guidance and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental prin-
ciples of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.

PricewaterhouseCoopers AG applies Swiss Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive sys-
tem of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, pro-
fessional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

assUraNCe PraCtitioNer’s resPoNsibiLity
Our responsibility is to perform an assurance engagement and to express an opinion on the ESG performance indicators 
outlined within the “Scope and subject matter” section above. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Inter-
national Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (revised) ‘Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews 
of historical financial information’. This standard requires that we plan and perform procedures to obtain limited assurance 
about whether the ESG performance indicators outlined within the “Scope and subject matter” section above was pre-
pared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the criteria as outline within the “Criteria” section above. 

Based on risk and materiality considerations, we performed our procedures to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance 
evidence. The procedures selected depend on the assurance practitioner’s judgement. The evidence gathering procedures 
were more limited than they would be on a reasonable assurance engagement and, therefore, less assurance was obtained 
than would be on a reasonable assurance engagement. 

We performed the following procedures, among others:
•  Review of application of the Novartis Corporate Responsibility Guideline
•  Interviewing personnel responsible for internal reporting and data collection
•  Performing tests on a sample basis of evidence supporting selected ESG data concerning completeness, accuracy, ade-

quacy, and consistency

•  Inspecting relevant documentation on a sample basis, including Novartis ESG policies, management reporting structures 

and documentation

•  Review of the management reporting processes for ESG reporting and assessing the consolidation process of data at 

Novartis Group level and the related controls

•  Inspecting the principles of the Novartis materiality assessment process providing the basis for the adherence to the GRI 
reporting requirements, addressing the soundness of the methodology, the identification process, the determination of 
the impacted stakeholders, as well as the prioritization based on the assessed impact of Novartis

We have not carried out any work on data other than outlined in the “Scope and subject matter” section as defined above. 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.

CoNCLUsioN
Based on the work we performed, nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that the ESG perfor-
mance indicators outlined within the “Scope and subject matter” section above of Novartis AG for the period ended Decem-
ber 31, 2021 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria as outline within the “Criteria” section 
above.

iNHereNt LiMitatioNs
The accuracy and completeness of the ESG performance indicators outlined within the “Scope and subject matter” sec-
tion above are subject to inherent limitations given their nature and methods for determining, calculating and estimating 
such data. Our Assurance Report should therefore be read in connection with the criteria as outline within the “Criteria” 
section above.

The maintenance and integrity of Novartis AG’s website is the responsibility of the Board of Directors and Management; the work carried out by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers AG does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers AG accepts no responsibility for 
any changes that may have occurred to the figures or criteria as published on Novartis AG’s website.

Mr. Zhang, who has heart failure, is one of approximately 300 000 people in China using AI Nurse, a digital health app that makes it easier for patients to manage cardiovascular disease progression.

Strong demand for heart failure medicine Entresto, psoriasis and autoimmune disease treatment Cosentyx, and recently launched therapies such as multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta helped us increase sales and net profit as we maintained cost discipline.

Looking ahead, we are confident we can maintain our momentum as we remain focused on operational excellence and science based innovation.

We started a strategic review of our Sandoz generics division with the goal of strengthening its operational performance and maximizing share holder return.

Also, we divested our investment in Roche Holding AG, reflecting our strategy to create a focused medicines company.

With more than 12 new drug approvals by the US Food and Drug Administra tion in the past five years, we are committed to our long term research and development (R D) strategy, which is aimed at creating break through therapies for patients with high unmet medical needs.

We strive to build leading market positions in fast growing areas of medicine and broaden patient reach to deliver on our purpose to improve and extend people’s lives around the world.

Acute pressure on societies and healthcare systems due to the COVID 19 pandemic remains high.

In this challenging environment, our focus on operational excellence and shift to flexible working by our employees continued to help us navigate the crisis.

In a post pandemic world, these lessons will enable us to maintain high levels of resilience and operational efficiency while continuing to position us as an employer of choice in a changing work environment.

Last year we continued to make significant investments in R D, including in cutting edge medical technologies such as radioligand therapy and small interfering RNA.

Our clinical pipeline covers a diverse area of noncommunicable diseases such as cancer and heart disease.

We also made further progress in our environmental, social and governance (ESG) activities, which are an essen tial part of our strategy and an impor tant reputation driver.

States to address health disparities all with the intention to create more equitable and sustainable healthcare systems and support the United Nations’ efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

The Board of Directors took further action to strengthen governance.

We paved the way for comprehensive ESG oversight and changed the leadership of the Compensation Committee and the Governance, Nomination and Corporate Responsi bilities Committee.

Together with the Executive Committee, the Board of Directors will continue the intensive dialogue with all stakeholder groups with a view to further strengthen trust in society and to maximize share holder return.

I thank you for the confidence you have placed in our company and am pleased to be able to propose a dividend increase of 3.3% to CHF 3.10 at the next Annual General Meeting.

The pandemic continues to disrupt care for patients across the spectrum of disease, creating a syndemic, or confluence of epidemics, that requires healthcare systems to cope with COVID 19 while caring for patients with chronic diseases.

Through the challenges ahead, there are reasons to be optimistic a health ier future is within our grasp includ ing the ways our industry has brought to this crisis the power of technology and shown once again the extraordi nary ability of science to overcome humanity’s greatest tests.

As we reimagine medicine at Novartis, our unwavering focus on our strategy and purpose enabled us to continue creating value for patients, healthcare professionals, healthcare systems, employees, shareholders and society.

The adaptability and commitment of our employees, together with the resilience of our operations and capabilities in data science and tech nology, minimized disruptions to our business.

Many changes, such as hybrid working, are now business as usual.

Our impact on the world remains extraordinary, with 766 million patients reached in 2021.

We received 21 approvals in the US, the EU, Japan and China, including two new mole cular entities.

Our siRNA therapy Leqvio is now approved in more than 50 countries, including the US.

We also demonstrated the strength of our in market portfolio, with medicines like Cosentyx, Entresto, Zolgensma, Kesimpta and Kisqali driving growth.

Our pipeline promises innovation for years to come.

We have built depth in five therapeutic areas and are building scale in five next generation technol ogy platforms.

We also received approval for Scemblix, a novel stamp inhibitor for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia.

We have a promising mid and late stage portfolio, with more than 20 assets with expected approval by 2026 that each have sales potential over USD 1 billion.

We also initiated a share buyback of up to USD 15 billion, underscoring our confidence in our mid and long term pipeline and growth outlook.

Progressing on our journey to build trust with society and furthering our legacy in global health and access, in 2021 Novartis reached the milestone of delivering a staggering 1 billion courses of malaria treatment to people in endemic countries.

We continue delivering on our longstand ing commitment to expand access, narrowing the time it takes to scale our latest innovations.

Our progress was underscored by improved envi ronmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings, and we once again ranked second in the Access to Medicine Index.

For example, AI Nurse, developed in collaboration with Tencent, helps patients with heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases manage disease progression.

Novartis also continued doing our part to end the pandemic, quickly scaling up production of COVID 19 vaccines.

We’re proud to have helped develop a potential new treatment option with Molecular Partners.

Our financial performance highlights the progress we’ve made and drives confidence for the future with 4% growth in net sales and 6% growth in core operating income from the previous year.

We’re confident we’ll drive consistent growth to 2030 and beyond.

We’ve also initiated a strate gic review of Sandoz to enable Sandoz to be positioned as a long term leader in the generics industry.

Emerging from the COVID 19 pande mic, I remain optimistic about a new era in medicine.

Stakeholders like you play an important role in that.

We develop and produce innovative medicines to address patient needs in disease areas where our experience and knowledge have the potential to produce transformative treatments.

We also offer about 1 000 generic and biosimilar medicines covering a broad range of therapeutic areas.

They can bring substantial savings to patients and healthcare systems, and help improve access to healthcare.

The greatest strength of Novartis is our people, whose diversity, energy and creativity are crucial to our success.

Around the world, we employ 108 514 people (104 323 full time equivalent positions), with around one fifth of our employees working in research and development.

Our Values and Behaviors underpin our culture and enable us to deliver on our purpose.

We encourage all Novartis employees to be inspired, curious and unbossed while acting with integrity.

The need for high quality healthcare has never been more urgent or important.

People around the world are living longer, fueling a rise in chronic diseases and pressuring healthcare systems to restrain spending growth.

At the same time, digital technology and a deeper understanding of the root causes of disease are accelerating medical innovation and opening new possibilities to improve the lives of patients.

Global demand for healthcare and associated spending is expected to grow over the next five years, supported by renewed economic growth and increased investment in healthcare in many countries after the COVID 19 pandemic.

We see growth for our business in many markets, including in the US and over the longer term in China.

At the same time, pressure on pharmaceutical pricing is expected to continue as payers step up initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare.

The use of data science and technologies such as artificial intelligence is increasing rapidly across our industry in everything from clinical trials and manufacturing to patient diagnostics and treatment.

Meanwhile, customers want more efficient and personalized ways to connect with pharmaceutical companies.

Against this backdrop, data privacy and cybersecurity are growing in importance.

The global medicines market is expected to grow at between 3 6% CAGR through 2025, according to IQVIA, a research firm.

Growth in non COVID 19 spending is expected to return to its pre pandemic outlook by 2023.

In China, spending on medicines is predicted to exceed USD 170 billion by 2025.

According to a 2021 survey by Deloitte, nearly two thirds of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals in the EU have increased their use of digital technology to support clinicians’ new ways of working.

Medical innovation is accelerating, as technologies such as gene therapy and ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapies open new paths to scientific discovery.

Increased co operation within the industry could lead to a new era of open science.

At the same time, innovation is getting harder, with new discoveries requiring significant long term investment.

Almost a third of the world’s population does not have access to the medicines they need.

For the past five years, access rates in the poorest countries have been declining.

Meanwhile, the COVID 19 pandemic has highlighted deep health inequities in both developed and developing countries.

In 2020, spending on research and development by the world’s 15 leading pharmaceutical companies reached USD 123 billion, an increase of 43% since 2015, according to research published in 2021 by IQVIA.

The number of people who lack access to essential medicines, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

As the complexity of the world’s healthcare challenges grows, the nature of the global disease burden is also changing.

Aging populations and lifestyle changes are fueling a rise in noncommunicable conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, driving an increase in disability and early death, and putting additional pressure on healthcare systems.

Post pandemic, many employees continue to want more flexibility in how they work.

Within our own workforce, there is more emphasis on digital skills.

At the same time, workplace diversity is more important than ever to attract and retain talented employees, and support innovation.

Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are responsible for 71% of global deaths, according to the WHO. Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, followed by cancer, respiratory diseases, and diabetes.

Nearly three quarters of workers want a mix of office based and remote working, according to a 2021 survey by Accenture.

Research also shows more flexible working can bring cost benefits for employers and can help companies widen their talent pool.

Climate change is already causing extreme heat and poor air quality in some areas, which threaten to exacerbate pre existing health conditions such as respiratory diseases.

In addition, an increase in temperature and humidity may cause a proliferation of insects that carry vector borne diseases, including dengue fever and malaria.

Ultimately, climate change could undermine decades of progress in improving human health at a time when antimicrobial resistance is also rising.

COVID 19 has brought an opportunity to reset public trust in our industry, with companies working together to end the pandemic.

Trust matters for our industry: Our success depends on patents and trademarks that are granted by society and protect the long term investments required for our business.

Trust also matters for patient engagement, for working with regulators and policymakers, and for attracting talented employees.

Between 2030 and 2050, the WHO expects climate change will cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths each year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress alone.

Worldwide, trust in pharmaceutical companies stood at 57% in 2021, according to the Edelman Trust Barometer.

Trust improved in the US, Germany, the UK and Italy, from 2020, though from relatively low levels.

We can deliver on our purpose only by working with a diverse range of individuals and groups who are important to our business.

Engaging these stakeholders helps us to better understand their needs and expectations, and work together toward common goals.

The table below shows a summary of why and how we engage with our main stakeholder groups.

We work with patients and caregivers to understand the effects of our medicines and to ensure our treatments address unmet medical needs.

We build relationships with customers including healthcare professionals and payers to understand their needs and constraints, and to explain the benefits and risks of our medicines.

We engage employees to develop skills, improve working conditions, and promote an inspired, curious and unbossed culture.

Every four years we conduct a detailed materiality assess ment to identify issues that matter most to our stakehold ers, and where we have the most potential to create value aligned with our purpose.

The assessment informs our strategy and our reporting on ESG topics, and guides our impact performance measurement.

Our latest materiality assessment, conducted in 2021, was based on a survey of more than 500 external stakeholders and 12 000 internal stakeholders, and 140 follow up interviews.

External stakeholders were drawn from our main stake holder groups, including patients, customers, partners and shareholders.

Internal stakeholders including senior management were drawn from across our business divisions.

Participants were asked to rank the impact of Novartis across eight impact clusters.

Overall, results were in line with our previous materiality assessment conducted in 2017 and were consistent across stakeholder groups: patient safety, access to healthcare, innovation and ethical business practices were again ranked highly.

Although environmental sus tainability was ranked lower than other impact clusters, it remains an essential component of our strategy and operating model.

This is about the safety of our medicines and is therefore part of our core responsibilities.

We have an important role to play in making our medicines available and affordable to as many people as possible.

Innovation is about helping to address the global burden of disease by researching and developing new medicines for unmet patient needs.

Acting responsibly and holding ourselves to high ethical standards are closely tied to trust in Novartis.

A strong corporate culture helps us attract and retain talent.

This topic is also about the health and safety of our employees, and fair working conditions.

This relates to our corporate governance: how we manage our company, take decisions and allocate resources.

This is about sustainable financial returns and allocation of capital to areas we believe have the most impact.

This relates to our management of emissions, waste and other effluents, and our consumption of natural resources.

Our strategy is to build a focused medicines company powered by technology leadership in research and development, world class commercialization, global access and data science.

As we implement this strategy, we have five priorities to help shape our decision making and ensure we continue to deliver on our purpose.

We strive to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations while maintaining high standards of patient safety, product quality and environmental sustainability.

These activities underpin our investments in innovation and support our financial performance, while helping to build trust with society.

Our aim is to transform Novartis into a medicines company powered by data science and digital technologies.

Using data, we believe, can improve efficiency, drive sales and spur innovation to enhance our pipeline of new medicines and improve outcomes for patients.

In our commercial operations, we aim to consistently deliver successful launches enabling broad and rapid access to our medicines.

To do this, we are embracing data analytics and technologies such as artificial intelligence while partnering with technology companies both large and small.

Our manufacturing operations are evolving as we invest in new technologies to improve productivity and respond to the changing business environment.

We also work to ensure the ethical and responsible use of new technologies and prioritize effective data privacy and cybersecurity.

We continue to transform our business services and technology functions to enable the execution of our strategy and drive profitable growth.

We seek to find new ways to cure disease, intervene earlier in chronic illnesses, and improve patients’ quality of life.

Our research and development (R D) programs stand to help millions of people living with cancer, heart disease, neurological conditions and immune system disorders, as well as a variety of other diseases.

We prioritize projects with the potential to transform the standard of care for patients, and we are investing in new technology platforms including cell and gene therapies, RNA therapies, and radioligand therapies that offer more targeted approaches to fighting and, in some cases, potentially curing serious diseases.

Our focus on transformative innovation is expected to drive above sector sales growth.

By 2026, we anticipate approval of more than 20 pipeline assets with the potential to become blockbuster medicines with annual sales of more than USD 1 billion.

We continue to transform our corporate culture to support our long term performance.

We want every employee to feel inspired by our purpose, be curious about new ideas, and work in an unbossed environment that encourages initiative and teamwork.

We are exploring new ways of working, post pandemic, to give employees greater flexibility and ensure we continue to attract and retain world class talent.

At the same time, we are making progress in diversity and inclusion to increase employee engagement and support innovation.

Building trust with patients, customers, partners, our employees and society is critical to delivering on our purpose.

It defines our approach to managing our key environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics: being part of the solution on pricing and access, addressing global health challenges, being a responsible citizen, and holding ourselves to high ethical standards.

We strive to make our medicines accessible to as many people as possible, while embedding ethics across our business, reducing our environmental footprint, and helping to address global issues such as antimicrobial resistance.

We take a systematic approach, integrating our ESG priorities across our strategy with clear targets and reporting.

Please see page 16 for more information on our ESG management targets.

We have made significant progress since we launched our strategy in 2018.

We have improved the productivity of our R D pipeline, delivered cost savings, and ramped up our investments in data and dig ital.

We have also made important progress in providing access to our medicines, and further strengthened our approach to ethics and compliance.

For more information on our performance against our strategy, see pages 28 86.

Our management targets covering environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics are integrated throughout our strategy.

By executing on our strategy and delivering on our purpose, we create value for our business and improve the lives of millions of people around the world.

Our medicines positively impact society by improving and extending the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world.

Through our business, we also create jobs and contribute to employee development both in our own operations and across our supply chain.

At the same time, our business impacts the environ ment through carbon emissions, water use and waste.

For more information on how we assess the impact of our business on society, please see the section Measuring and valuing our impact.

We are committed to supporting the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

An analysis by Trucost, a third party sustainability data provider, showed that our most significant positive impact is on goal 3 (good health and well being), which aligns closely with our purpose.

We also positively impact goal 8 (decent work and economic growth), goal 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and goal 10 (reduced inequalities) through our business and operations, including our efforts to expand access to our medicines.

Through our environmental targets, we contribute to goal 6 (clean water and sanitation), goal 7 (affordable and clean energy) and goal 13 (climate action).

The GRI Content Index of this report contains a mapping of our activities against the SDGs.

This infographic is informed by the Integrated Reporting Framework of the Value Reporting Foundation.

Impact valuation is an emerging discipline that seeks to measure the positive and negative effects of companies on society.

Novartis is pioneering an approach called social, environmental and economic (SEE) impact valuation that aims to show the positive impact we bring to countries, health systems and individuals, balanced by the negative impact of our operations on the environment and other areas.

Expressing these impacts in monetary terms makes them transparent and comparable for stakeholders.

Our latest SEE impact valuation figures for 2020 take into account the social impact of our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz product portfolio in 131 countries.

We also assessed our impact on living wages and employee development in our own operations and in our supply chain, as well as our contributions to gross domestic product and employment in the countries in which we operate.

At the same time, we measured the negative impact of our business on occupational safety both in our own operations and across our supply chain as well as the negative impact of carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use and waste.

Minimizing risks associated with third parties in our supply chain and improving environmental sustain ability are key parts of our strategy and operating model.

For more information, please see the section Embrace operational excellence.

While impact valuation methodology is still evolving, our efforts are based on current leading approaches.

For example, we engage with WifOR, an independent economic research institute, to calculate the social impact of our medicines, our direct GDP contribution, and our indirect and induced environmental and economic impacts.

We are also a founding member of the Value Balancing Alliance (VBA), a nonprofit organiza tion that aims to create a standard for measuring and disclosing the value companies provide to society.

With the exception of the social impact of our medicines, which is specific to our industry, all other reported impact indicators are subject to standardiza tion through the VBA.

We first applied our impact valuation methodology in 2016.

Since then, we have further developed the approach and expanded its scope.

SEE impact valuation results have been used by Novartis teams for stakeholder engagement and busi ness decision making.

We also engage with stakeholders to raise awareness of impact valuation and promote standardization.

In 2021, we hosted our fourth annual Co Creating Impact Summit with more than 1 800 participants from academia, industry, the investment community and other areas.

Nature (social impact of wages and salaries), VBA (employee development, occupational safety, waste, land use) and Impact Valuation Roundtable (general approach).

Our strategy brings opportunities for our stakeholders and society for example, by creating new medical breakthroughs or expanding access to our medicines.

At the same time, our strategy also carries risks.

Many of these relate to our business environment, such as the uncertainty inherent in research and development (R D), or changing societal expectations of our industry.

The Novartis Enterprise Risk Manage ment (ERM) framework is designed to generate a holistic view of risks for the company and drive a culture of smart risk taking.

While our Code of Ethics sets the ethical framework for all employees to manage risk across our business, risk management is a fundamental leadership responsibility that involves active engagement by leaders at each stage of the process.

The overall ERM process is the responsibility of the Chief Ethics, Risk Compliance Officer, with oversight from the Executive Committee of Novartis and the Board of Directors.

For further details on governance of risk at Novartis, please see the section Our corporate governance approach.

Our ERM framework is aligned with our strategic planning and helps us better understand our overall level of risk exposure.

The Risk Resilience team conducts risk workshops and collaborates with all risk assurance functions to identify key risks across the company.

Each Novartis unit organizes a focused risk workshop at the leadership level.

In parallel, risk workshops are held in our largest markets by revenue and in certain focus markets.

Compass, which groups risks into three categories: strategic, operational and emerging.

Risks are rated based on likelihood and potential impact over the next five years, using the most probable worst case scenario for each risk as a reference point.

Once key risks are identified, mitigation plans are created.

In addition to the three categories described above, we identify separate awareness topics that we believe may become new risks over time.

The Risk Compass helps senior management and our Board of Direc tors focus discussions on key risks and align strategy with risk exposure.

We regularly monitor risks and revise our assessments, if necessary.

Strategic risks are the most consequential to our ability to execute our strategy or achieve our business objectives.

Emerging risks require close monitoring and have the potential to become strategic or operational risks.

Operational risks relate to internal processes or systems, employee errors or external events.

Awareness topics are longer term trending topics that have the potential to become new risks.

Of these, seven are categorized as strate gic, nine as operational, and the remain ing four as emerging.

In addition, we have identified four awareness topics.

Overall, our 2021 risk portfolio is broadly consistent with the previous year.

Sandoz business transforma tion was added as a new strategic risk in 2021, reflecting the increasingly competitive environment for generic medicines.

Additionally, facility and workplace safety was renamed occupational health and workplace safety in 2021 to incorporate aspects of the post pandemic working envi ronment such as employee well being that were identified as an emerging risk in 2020.

Risks in focus The table below provides an overview of our seven strategic risks.

For more information on our full risk portfolio, please see Item 3.D ( Risk factors ) in the Novartis Annual Report.

We engage in costly, lengthy and uncertain R D activities, both independently and in collaboration with third parties, to identify and develop new products and new indications for existing products.

Failure can occur at any point, including after substan tial investment.

New products must undergo intensive preclinical and clinical testing.

Further, regulatory authorities continue to establish new and increasingly rigorous requirements for approval and reimbursement.

The post approval regulatory burden has also increased.

Enter into agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and with academic and other institutions to develop new products.

Accelerate the use of data science and digital technology to make the drug discovery and development process more efficient and effective.

Rapid adoption of digital technology is transforming our industry.

There is a risk of Novartis missing the opportunity while other companies with specialized expertise or business models may enter the healthcare field, potentially disrupting our relationships with patients, healthcare professionals, customers, distributors and suppliers.

Develop a digital operating model to enable faster innovation, simplify our operations and improve productivity.

Accelerate the implementation of a new customer engagement model, which combines traditional face to face visits with virtual engagements with healthcare professionals.

We are similarly changing our approach to partnering with healthcare systems, payers and other healthcare providers.

Our ability to grow our business depends on the commercial success of key products.

Their success could be impacted by a number of factors, including pressure from new or existing competitive products changes in the prescribing habits of healthcare professionals unexpected side effects or safety signals supply chain issues or other product shortages pricing pressures regulatory proceedings changes in labeling loss of intellectual property protection and global pandemics.

Pursue a launch excellence strategy in commercial execution, including investing earlier in pre launch activities and using data science to test and learn from new commercial models.

Accelerate the implementation of a new customer engagement model, which combines traditional face to face visits with virtual engagements with healthcare professionals.

We are similarly changing our approach to partnering with healthcare systems, payers and other healthcare providers.

As part of our strategy, we acquire and divest products or entire businesses, and enter into strategic alliances and collaborations.

This strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and move forward with strategic opportunities.

Efforts to develop and market acquired products, to integrate acquired businesses or to achieve expected synergies may fail or may not fully meet expectations.

Also, our strategic alliances and collaborations with third parties may not achieve their intended goals and objectives.

Establish an enterprise wide business development strategy to identify external opportunities that align with and advance our corporate strategy.

Enhance our risk based due diligence approach through end to end risk management.

Our Sandoz Division faces competition and pricing pressures as it seeks to increase its market share and achieve sustainable and profitable growth mid term.

Our strategy for Sandoz focuses on accelerating bio similars growth in the long term rebuilding the Sandoz US business and achieving inorganic growth by identifying and successfully executing on merger and acquisition and strategic in licensing partnership opportunities.

Failure to achieve these goals may have a material adverse effect on the success of the Sandoz Division and the Group as a whole, as well as potentially on our results of operations and financial condition.

Rebuild the US business by increasing loss of exclusivity coverage and enhancing our pipeline with first to file launches.

Pursue inorganic growth opportunities, for example through bolt on acquisitions and in licensing.

We experience significant pressures on the pricing of our products and on our ability to obtain and maintain satisfactory rates of reimbursement from governments, insurers and other payers.

These pressures have many sources, including rising healthcare costs (exacerbated by the COVID 19 pandemic) funding restrictions and policy changes and public controver sies, debate, investigations and legal proceedings around pharma ceutical pricing.

Such pressures may impact product pricing and market access.

We also face price controls and other measures imposed by governments and other payers.

In addition, our Sandoz Division faces continued price erosion in the generics and biosimilars segment.

Establish dedicated teams that actively seek to optimize patient access, including formulary positions, for our products.

Increase efforts to enable patient access through innovative pricing and access initiatives in the US, Europe and other markets, including contract structures such as pay over time and outcome based agreements.

Continue to execute against access to medicine and global health targets.

These targets are backed by a sustainability linked bond, which embeds them into the core of our business operations.

Increasingly, in addition to their financial performance, companies are being judged on their performance on a variety of environ mental, social and governance (ESG) matters.

A variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized.

In addition, investment in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such ESG measures in making their investment decisions.

An inability to successfully perform on ESG matters and meet societal expectations can result in negative impacts to our reputation, recruitment, retention, operations, financial results and share price.

Further develop the Novartis ESG strategy based on the results of the 2021 global materiality assessment.

Revisit and further strengthen our environmental target for full carbon neutrality by 2030 by committing to achieve net zero across the Novartis value chain by 2040.

Novartis delivered a solid financial performance in 2021, supported by sales growth in key products and increased margins.

These factors helped counter the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic in some therapeutic areas and a challenging environment for our generics business.

Strong sales of key products contin ued to underpin our financial perfor mance in 2021.

Novartis full year net sales were USD 51.6 billion, up 4% from the prior year when measured in constant currencies (cc) to remove the impact of exchange rate move ments, and up 6% when measured in US dollar terms.

The COVID 19 pandemic continued to impact some therapeutic areas most notably oncology and our generics business.

Sales of our heart failure medicine Entresto grew 40% (cc) to USD 3.5 billion, driven by increased patient share across major markets.

In 2021, Entresto received approval in the US for an expanded indication in chronic heart failure.

Cosentyx, our treatment for psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases, also continued to grow strongly.

Sales rose 17% (cc) from the prior year to USD 4.7 billion, driven by demand in the US and Europe as well as strong volume growth in China.

Meanwhile, Zolgensma, our gene therapy for children with spinal muscular atrophy, delivered sales of USD 1.4 billion, up 46% (cc), reaching blockbuster status for the first time.

Kesimpta, a treat ment for relapsing multiple sclerosis that was approved in Europe in 2021, had sales of USD 372 million, driven by launch uptake, strong access and increased demand.

Our oncology products also con tributed to the solid performance.

Promacta, a treatment for blood disorders that is known as Revolade outside the US, grew 15% (cc) to USD 2.0 billion.

Kisqali, a breast cancer treatment, had sales of USD 937 million, up 36% (cc).

Jakavi, a treatment for blood disorders and cancers, grew 16% (cc) to USD 1.6 billion, showing double digit growth across all regions.

Sales of Sandoz biopharmaceuticals continued to be a bright spot, with a 7% (cc) increase to USD 2.1 billion.

However, that was countered by price competition and softer retail demand, including the impact of a weak cough and cold season, leading to an overall decline ( 2%4 cc 0% in US dollar terms) in Sandoz Division net sales.

Novartis Group sales in Europe, our largest market, grew 5% (cc).

Sales in emerging growth markets grew 11% (cc), led by a double digit increase in China.

Operating income was USD 11.7 billion, up 13% (cc) from the prior year, mainly driven by higher sales and lower legal expenses, partly offset by increased investments in marketing and sales and in research and development, and higher amortization.

Net income was USD 24.0 billion, benefiting from the USD 14.6 billion gain from the divest ment of our investment in Roche.

To help people understand our under lying performance, we also present our core results, which exclude the impact of amortization, restructurings, acqui sitions and other significant items.

Core operating income of USD 16.6 billion rose 6% (cc).

Core earnings per share were USD 6.29, up 7% (cc).

Free cash flow of USD 13.3 billion was up 14%, driven by higher operating income adjusted for non cash items and lower payments for legal provisions, partly offset by a USD 650 million upfront payment to in license tislelizumab from an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd.

Meanwhile, sales of three products Sandostatin, A nitor Votubia, and Votrient declined due to increased competition in major markets.

In February we signed an agreement to acquire GlaxoSmithKline’s cephalosporin antibiotics business, reinforcing Sandoz’s leading global position in antibiotics.

In May we announced plans to further expand Sandoz antibiotics production capabilities in Kundl, Austria, and in Palafolls, Spain.

By modernizing and simplifying its manufacturing setup, Sandoz will improve its ability to consistently deliver high quality medicines to patients while remaining cost competitive in the global market.

In June we announced the launch of generic oncology treatment pemetrexed in 11 countries across Europe, including Germany, Switzerland, and Spain.

The Sandoz Division is a global leader in generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars, and sells products in more than 100 countries.

The division has three global franchises: Retail Generics, Biopharmaceuticals and Anti Infectives.

Sandoz net sales were USD 9.6 billion in 2021, decreasing by 2%1 (cc) from the previous year, as volume growth in our Biopharmaceuticals and contract manufacturing businesses was offset by the effects of price competition and continued headwinds for our Retail Generics business in the US.

We continued to see an impact from COVID 19, particularly in the Retail Generics and Anti Infectives busi nesses.

However, the effects have been more moderate in recent months and the Sandoz business is continuing to normalize.

Sandoz sales in Europe declined 2% (cc) due to the impact of COVID 19 on the Retail Generics business.

Core operating income was USD 2.1 billion, declining 14% (cc) from the previous year due to unfavorable gross margin and lower sales.

Sales in the Retail Generics business declined 4% (cc) to USD 7.1 billion, impacted primarily by continued sales volume decline in the US for oral solids as a result of partnership terminations.

Sales in the Biopharmaceuticals franchise grew 7% (cc) to USD 2.1 bil lion, driven by continued growth outside the US. Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets protein and other biotechnology based products, including biosimilars, and provides biotechnology manufacturing services to other companies.

In Anti Infectives, Sandoz manufactures and supplies active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates, mainly antibiotics, for use by the Retail Generics franchise and for sale to third party customers.

Total franchise sales were USD 1.1 billion, a decrease of 5% (cc) from the prior year.

In 2021, Novartis announced that it will commence a strategic review of the Sandoz Division.

The review will explore all options, ranging from retaining the business to separation, to determine how to best maximize value for our shareholders.

Ms. Delgado is one of 850 million people worldwide living with kidney disease.

Every day, Novartis is working to reduce the burden of disease for patients and societies around the world.

More than 20 000 Novartis employees in research and development deploy cutting edge technologies to find new ways to cure disease, intervene earlier in chronic illnesses and improve patients’ quality of life.

Advancing a strong and diverse pipeline We have one of the strongest clinical development programs in the industry, spanning around 50 diseases.

Putting patients at the center of our clinical trials We integrate the views of patients and caregivers into how we research and develop new medicines, and we strive to include diverse patient populations in our clinical trials.

The COVID 19 pandemic is only one example of the enormous burden that disease puts on society.

From leading causes of death such as heart dis ease and cancer, to rare but debilitat ing genetic disorders, the disability and mortality associated with serious illness harms economic growth and exacerbates social inequality.

Finding solutions to these problems is why Novartis exists.

Our more than 20 000 employees in research and development (R D) work to discover and develop medicines for diseases with high unmet need.

Our R D teams have built depth in core disease areas including cardiovascular and renal, oncology, hematology, immunology and neuroscience, while we maintain innovative investigational and in market programs in ophthalmology and respiratory allergy.

We are also advancing our pipeline of investiga tional medicines for malaria and other neglected diseases.

With our strong capabilities across five platforms chemical biology, biotherapeutics (biologics), radioli gand therapy, cell therapy and gene therapy we have a unique founda tion to address disease burdens faced by people around the world today and for decades to come.

Novartis continued to deliver trans formative innovation to patients in 2021.

We received 21 major approvals, including new treatments for high cho lesterol and chronic myeloid leukemia, and made 34 major submissions.

We advanced our diverse pipeline of investigational therapies, with three breakthrough therapy designations from the US Food and Drug Adminis tration (FDA) and around 20 clinical data readouts paving the way for further launches in 2022 and beyond.

The Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) leads drug discovery and development from concept to early clinical evaluation, and also partners with an external network of around 300 academic collaborators and 100 industry collaborators focused on areas of mutual scientific interest.

Global Drug Development (GDD) leads the advanced clinical development of potential new medi cines, running large clinical trials and steering the way to regulatory approval and access for patients.

These efforts have given Novartis one of the strongest discovery and development programs in the industry, with more than 275 research pro grams as well as 98 assets in devel opment, spanning around 50 diseases and 71 new molecular entities.

We invested USD 9.5 billion in R D in 2021, or approximately 18.5% of our net sales, compared with USD 9.0 billion in 2020.

We prioritize projects with the poten tial to transform the standard of care for patients.

Approximately 85% of our treatments in development have the potential to be first in class or first in a specific indication, while about 80% target areas of high unmet patient need.

We systematically integrate access into our discovery and development work.

For example, we regularly review all drug development submis sions and hold our clinical research teams accountable for acting on access opportunities.

We also engage patients in how we research and develop our medicines, and we strive to include diverse patient populations in our studies to ensure we under stand how patients everywhere might respond to a medicine.

We use data and digital strategies across our R D operations to open new paths to scientific discovery, improve patient outcomes and streamline the development process.

Our investments in digital technology also helped to keep our clinical trials on track during the COVID 19 pan demic.

For more information, please see the section Go big on data and digital.

We are advancing more than 160 projects in full clinical development, with 54 ongoing Phase III programs.

By 2026, we anticipate approval of 20 pipeline assets with the potential to become blockbuster medicines with annual sales of more than USD 1 billion.

Building on our success in small mole cule therapies and biologics, we are also investing in advanced technolo gies that offer new treatment para digms for patients, such as radioligand therapies and gene therapies.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide.

It is one of several complex and often interrelated chronic disorders along with renal and metabolic diseases that together affect billions of people around the globe.

Novartis is pioneer ing treatments that address the spectrum of these diseases.

Entresto is approved in more than 100 countries for the treatment of adult symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, a condition in which the heart fails to pump blood as well as it should.

In 2021, Entresto was granted an expanded indication in the US and other countries, allow ing for the treatment of most chronic heart failure patients, including all those with an ejection fraction below normal.

Also in 2021, Entresto received approval in China and Japan for treatment of patients with essential hypertension, the most common form of high blood pressure.

This new indication makes Entresto the first new therapy for hypertension in China in over 10 years.

Leqvio is a novel treatment that reduces low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a highly important modifi able risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which accounts for over 85% of all CVD deaths.

Clinical studies showed that this first and only small interfering RNA therapy for ASCVD can reduce LDL cholesterol by up to 52%, on top of maximally tolerated statins, through two injections per year, after an initial dose and one at three months.

Leqvio has been approved in more than 50 countries, including the US and the EU, as well as in the UK as part of a population health management agreement that is expected to reach up to 300 000 patients in three years.

TQJ230 (pelacarsen), another nucleic acid based therapy, is currently in Phase III development for the second ary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with elevated levels of lipoprotein(a), an independent inherited ASCVD risk factor that cannot be effectively addressed by diet and other lifestyle changes.

Phase II trial data showed that TQJ230 can reduce lipoprotein(a) in high risk patients below recognized risk thresholds.

LNP023 (iptacopan) is an investiga tional treatment for several severe, life limiting kidney conditions, includ ing C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) two diseases that mainly affect younger patients as well as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a life threatening blood disorder.

In 2021, we announced that LNP023 met its primary endpoints for C3G and its primary endpoint for IgAN in Phase II clinical trials.

Cancer, one of the world’s leading causes of death, inflicts a growing burden.

Global cancer deaths are expected to nearly double by 2040 due mainly to population growth and aging.

Novartis is a leader in finding new treatments for cancer, with approxi mately 45 compounds in development across four therapeutic platforms: targeted treatments, radioligand therapies, cell therapies and immuno therapies.

Lung cancer More people die of lung cancer than any other type of cancer, with death rates increasing in many parts of the world.

ACZ885 (canakinumab) is an antibody treatment currently in Phase III development for non small cell lung cancer.

It was accelerated into lung cancer studies after results in a large scale cardiovascular study demonstrated a significantly lower than expected lung cancer mortality.

In 2021, we reported that two Phase III trials in non small cell lung cancer for second and first line patients did not meet their primary endpoints.

In the first line study, however Novartis researchers observed potentially meaningful improvements among certain groups of patients.

These results support continued study of ACZ885 in earlier stages of lung cancer and further evaluation of Pro Tumor Inflammation in all lung cancer settings.

Studies of ACZ885 in both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting are ongoing.

In our mid stage pipeline, we are exploring the potential of two com pounds discovered at NIBR JDQ443 and TNO155 to target the previously undruggable proteins KRAS and SHP2, respectively.

If proven effective, the combination therapy could open up new treatment options for patients with lung cancer as well as other hard to treat tumors.

Our oncology pipeline also includes LXH254 (naporafenib), a targeted cancer therapy currently being studied in multiple combinations in defined populations of melanoma and lung cancer patients, and NIS793, for which the FDA has granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in combination with chemotherapy.

Prostate cancer Prostate cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer in people with a prostate gland, with poor survival prognosis in metastatic disease.

Novartis is exploring a new, targeted way to treat metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with 177Lu PSMA 617 (lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan), an investiga tional radioligand therapy.

In 2021, the FDA granted 177Lu PSMA 617 break through therapy designation after a Phase III study showed that the treatment plus existing care options significantly improved overall survival and radiographic progression free survival for patients with mCRPC compared to existing care options alone.

Regulatory submissions for 177Lu PSMA 617 have been accepted by the FDA and European Medicines Agency.

Breast cancer Breast cancer, the most common cancer in women, is responsible for more than 685 000 deaths per year.

We continue to see results from our clinical program for Kisqali.

The results of a Phase III study announced in 2021 showed that Kisqali in combi nation with an aromatase inhibitor achieved an overall survival benefit of more than five years for postmeno pausal women with hormone receptor positive (HR ) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2 ) advanced breast cancer, which is the most common subtype of the disease.

The data represent the longest reported median survival from a randomized trial in HR HER2 advanced breast cancer.

Novartis is also conducting a Phase III study of Kisqali with endocrine therapy in the adjuvant treatment of HR HER2 early breast cancer.

Piqray is approved in the US and the EU for breast cancer patients whose disease harbors a PIK3CA mutation.

With a breakthrough approval 20 years ago, Novartis opened the door to reimagine CML and other cancers.

Despite these advance ments, we’re not standing still.

In May 2001, Novartis received approval in the US for the first targeted therapy for cancer, known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

This was a watershed moment in drug discovery, transforming the treatment landscape for CML and opening the door to treatment possibilities for other forms of cancer and blood disorders.

Today the estimated five year survival rate for CML is above 70% in the 1970s, it was only 22%.

Yet despite CML being transformed into a chronic disease for many patients, significant unmet needs still remain particularly for patients who have experienced resistance or intolerance to available treatments.

Our research continues, and in 2021 we received US approval of a new treatment for CML in two distinct indications, offering a new treatment option for patients who are resistant or intolerant to existing therapies, and marking another milestone in our long standing scientific commitment to patients living with CML.

PIK3CA mutated advanced breast cancer patients immediately after failure on prior CDK4 6i treatment (a type of targeted treatment).

Devel opment is underway for five new indications, including PIK3CA relative overgrowth syndrome, a group of rare disorders that cause overgrowth of parts of the body.

In 2021, we reported that a Phase III clinical study of our chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy Kymriah as a second line treatment in aggressive B cell non Hodgkin lymphoma did not meet its primary endpoint.

We continue to study Kymriah in other forms of lymphoma and leukemia.

Hematology Scemblix, a new treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), was approved by the FDA in 2021 for use in patients who are resistant or intolerant to prior treatments, and also for patients with a specific mutation.

Discovered by researchers at NIBR, the treatment highlights our ongoing commitment to patients with the disease (see Two decades of pio neering innovation in chronic myeloid leukemia on the previous page).

MBG453 (sabatolimab) is an anti TIM 3 monoclonal antibody being studied for the treatment of higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, both rare blood cancers.

In 2021, MBG453 received a fast track designation from the FDA and an orphan drug designa tion from the European Commission.In 2021, we reported that a Phase III clinical study of Kymriah as a second line treatment in aggressive B cell non Hodgkin lymphoma did not meet its primary endpoint.

We continue to study Kymriah in other forms of lymphoma and leukemia.

Our R D teams are pioneering the development of therapies for immune system disorders, skin conditions and other diseases with high unmet needs.

We are committed to developing medicines that will advance the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), so patients are able to live their lives without the distressing and unpredictable symptoms of this skin disease.

Any new therapies will add to our portfolio of medicines that already includes Xolair, our existing approved therapy for CSU.

Enrollment began in 2021 for Phase III studies in CSU of LOU064 (remibruti nib), an oral BTK inhibitor that we are investigating for a number of immune mediated conditions.

Also in 2021, Phase III clinical trials for QGE031 (ligelizumab), a next genera tion monoclonal anti immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody, showed that QGE031 demonstrated superiority compared with placebo in the treatment of CSU, but not versus Xolair.

Novartis is continuing to evaluate the trial data.

We also continue to evaluate the potential for QGE031 to bring benefit to patients in the areas of chronic inducible urticaria and food allergy, where there is significant unmet need.

Cosentyx, our treatment for several systemic inflammatory conditions, continues to show strength in addressing a variety of debilitating dermatological and rheumatological conditions.

In 2021, we announced approvals of Cosentyx in the US and China for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, as well as in the US to treat active juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) in patients aged 2 years and older, and active enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) in patients aged 4 years and older.

Cosentyx is the only biologic treatment approved for children and adolescents for both ERA and JPsA in the US.

Cosentyx is also being studied for other inflammatory conditions, including hidradenitis suppurativa, giant cell arteritis and lichen planus, highlighting our commitment to expand Cosentyx to more indications and provide new treatment options for patients.

In 2021, we announced the discontin uation of a Phase IIb study of CFZ533 (iscalimab) in kidney transplant patients.

The study of CFZ533 in liver transplant continues, as do studies exploring CFZ533 as a potential treatment in other conditions, such as hidradenitis suppurativa and Sj gren’s syndrome.

Neurological diseases are a leading cause of death and disability world wide.

Our work in neurological disor ders includes investigational treat ments for multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and other diseases.

Our gene therapy Zolgensma is a treatment for both presymptomatic and symptomatic children with SMA, a devastating neurodevelopmental disease.

Building on our success with Zolgensma, in 2021 we started a new Phase III study of an intrathecal formulation in treatment naive patients with SMA type 2.

Early patient identification through newborn screening is critical for SMA patients since the disease causes irreplacea ble motor neuron loss.

For more on how we work with payers and health care systems to highlight the impor tance of early screening for SMA patients, please see the section Embrace operational excellence.

Our comprehensive portfolio for MS a debilitating chronic disease that affects 2.8 million people worldwide emphasizes our commitment to improving the quality of life for people living with MS at all stages of the disease.

Kesimpta, one of our thera pies for MS, received approval in the EU in 2021 for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS in adults with active disease.

It is already approved in the US and other key markets.

Kesimpta is the first B cell therapy that can be self administered at home.

In 2021, we also started Phase III trials to investigate LOU064 in patients with relapsing forms of MS.

We are exploring other neurological conditions where the need for new treatments is pressing.

One example is Huntington’s disease, a rare, inherited neurodegenerative condition that leads to progressive disability and death.

There currently are no approved therapies that delay onset of the disease or slow its progression.

LMI070 (branaplam), our investiga tional, oral small molecule RNA splicing modulator, could potentially treat Huntington’s disease by targeting RNA to reduce levels of a mutant protein.

In 2021, Novartis and UCB announced a global co development and co com mercialization agreement to bring potentially disease modifying thera pies to people living with Parkinson’s disease, which affects more than 10 million people worldwide.

These investigational therapies include UCB0599, a small molecule, alpha synuclein misfolding inhibitor currently in Phase II development, which is being studied to understand if it can slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease.

In addition, upon completion of an ongoing Phase I program, there is an opt in to co develop UCB7853, an anti alpha synuclein antibody.

We are working to find innovative treatments for diseases of the eye, with the goal of reducing or eliminat ing the huge burden on patients and society caused by visual impairment and blindness.

One of our novel treatments is UNR844, a topical ophthalmic solution currently in Phase II development for presbyo pia a common, gradual, age related loss of the ability to focus actively on nearby objects, caused by loss of elasticity of the lens of the eye.

In 2021, Novartis announced an agreement to acquire the UK based ocular gene therapy company Gyro scope Therapeutics, adding to our pipeline a one time gene therapy that could transform care for geographic atrophy (GA), an advanced form of dry age related macular degeneration (AMD) that leads to progressive and irreversible vision loss.

There are no approved treatments for GA, making it one of the most significant unmet needs remaining in retinal diseases.

GT005, the lead asset from Gyro scope Therapeutics, is designed as an AAV2 based, one time investiga tional gene therapy for GA secondary to AMD that is delivered under the retina.

Completion of the acquisition is subject to customary closing condi tions.

Novartis and Gyroscope Thera peutics will continue to operate as separate and independent companies until closing.

Respiratory and allergy and accelerate the next generation of radioligand therapies for cancer.

Novartis is developing novel therapies to treat respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmo nary disease and fibrotic lung dis eases.

These illnesses affect the lives of millions of people worldwide, and evidence suggests the burden is increasing due to climate change.

Building on our success with Xolair, the first biologic brought to market for asthma, we are pursuing Phase II studies for CSJ117, an inhaled biologic adjuvant therapy for severe uncon trolled asthma.

We also initiated Phase III studies of QGE031 for patients with IgE mediated peanut allergy.

Novartis is investing in new technolo gies and platforms that offer more targeted approaches to fighting and, in some cases, potentially curing serious diseases.

We have the depth and scale to discover, develop and commercialize therapies using these advanced platforms.

Radioligand therapy delivers preci sion targeted radiation to cancer cells widely disseminated in the body, with the goal of limiting damage to sur rounding tissue.

It has the potential to address a wide range of cancers and become a major pillar of cancer care.

Novartis has built a strong foundation in this area with Lutathera, our first approved radioligand therapy, and with 177Lu PSMA 617, our investiga tional therapy for prostate cancer (see Oncology above).

In 2021, we acquired fibroblast associated protein (FAP) targeted assets from iThera nostics.

We launched a collaboration with Artios to explore novel combina tions of radioligand therapy and DNA damage pathway inhibitors and with PeptiDream to work on macrocyclic and constrained peptides.

We also established a partnership with Molec ular Partners to work on DARPin protein based binding domains.

In gene therapy, one of our technolo gies uses benign viruses called adeno associated viruses (AAVs) to deliver genes to cells inside the body.

The goal is to repair the cells with a one time treatment.

Our first approved AAV based therapy was Zolgensma for SMA, and we are now exploring experimental forms of gene therapy for other diseases, from brain disease to blood disorders.

Altogether we have more than 20 research programs in gene therapy.

The Novartis early stage pipeline features a growing arsenal of optoge netic gene therapies, based on genetically engineered light sensitive proteins that can rewire cells in the eye, allowing them to act as replace ment photoreceptors.

In 2020 and 2021, we obtained two key optoge netic technologies through the acquisitions of Vedere Bio and Arctos Medical.

The resulting therapies could potentially treat blinding diseases such as inherited retinal dystrophies and age related macular degenera tion, which affect millions of patients worldwide.

With cell therapy, a patient has key cell types extracted and genetically modified in a clinical lab before being injected back into the body.

An example of this is CAR T therapy, a treatment generated from a patient’s own T cells.

Novartis was the first pharmaceutical company to signifi cantly invest in pioneering CAR T research and initiate global CAR T trials.

Our flagship CAR T therapy, Kymriah, was the first cell therapy approved in the US for certain kinds of leukemia and lymphoma, and is now available to patients in 30 coun tries.

We aim to broaden the impact of CAR T technology to help patients with a variety of difficult to treat hematological cancers and solid tumors.

Novartis has a resilient global CAR T manufacturing footprint, spanning seven facilities across four continents.

In 2021, we announced the develop ment of a novel manufacturing plat form created at NIBR called T Charge, which is expected to improve the therapeutic potency of the T cell product while halving the time needed to take cells from the patient, manufacture the product, and return it to a healthcare professional for administration.

Our R D efforts include discovering and developing novel medicines for our company’s flagship global health priorities, as well as other diseases that predominantly affect underserved patients in lower income countries, while exploring new ways to treat COVID 19, the most urgent public health issue in the world today.

We are collaborating with Molecular Partners to develop ensovibep, a potential new treatment option for COVID 19 that targets the virus using proprietary DARPin technology to neutralize SARS CoV 2.

The topline results of a Phase II study reported in early 2022 showed that a single intravenous dose of ensovibep reduced viral load through Day Eight, shortened symptom duration, reduced emergency room visits and or hospi talizations related to COVID 19, and reduced deaths, compared to pla cebo.

In separate studies, it main tained potent in vitro pan variant activity against all variants of concern identified so far, including Omicron.

Novartis in licensed ensovibep from Molecular Partners.

We will accelerate manufacturing scale up and plan to seek expedited regulatory authoriza tions globally.

Separately, we are working to dis cover a novel therapy targeting the main protease an enzyme essential to viral replication across coronavi ruses, including SARS CoV 2.

The goal is to develop a therapy that could treat many or all other forms of coronaviruses, potentially addressing future pandemics.

Malaria continues to burden societies across the globe, particularly in Africa, and evidence suggests that cases may rise as a result of climate change.

Novartis has taken a multipronged approach to fighting the disease, working with partners such as Medi cines for Malaria Venture to research, develop and manufacture a portfolio of essential antimalarial drugs.

In 1999, we introduced our first malaria drug, a highly effective fixed dose of artemisinin based combina tion therapy.

In 2021, we crossed the 1 billion mark in antimalarial treat ments delivered to patients worldwide (please see Build trust with society for more information).

For more than 20 years, the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD), part of NIBR, has been at the fore front in the search for novel medicines for malaria and other neglected diseases.

Two Novartis compounds for uncomplicated and severe malaria, KAF156 (ganaplacide) and KAE609 (cipargamin), respectively, are in clinical trials in Africa and Asia.

These compounds could potentially address resistance to current therapies as well as provide simplified therapeutic regimens.

In 2021, a Phase IIb study of KAF156 and its partner medicine, lumefantrine, in adults and children with malaria reported positive results, supporting continued development of the combination treatment.

NITD, with funding from the Wellcome Trust, is in the early stages of a discovery program aimed at finding first in class curative anti parasitic therapies for Chagas disease, a serious condition affecting more than 6 million people mainly in Latin America.

We are also conducting a Phase IV trial of our heart failure medicine Entresto in patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy.

Chagas disease is a tropical parasitic infection but can manifest in the long term as chronic heart failure or other complications, causing disability and even death.

With an estimated 50 000 to 90 000 new cases per year, visceral leishmani asis is the most serious form of leishmaniasis, causing fever, weight loss, spleen and liver enlargement, and death if left untreated.

In 2020, we announced a collaboration with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initia tive (DNDi) to jointly develop LXE408, a first in class inhibitor of the kineto plastid proteasome, for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis.

Within the scope of the agreement, Novartis is responsible for Phase I studies, technical research and development activities, and regulatory interactions.

Upon approval, we have committed to distributing the drug on an affordable basis worldwide to maximize access in endemic countries.

DNDi will lead Phase II and III clinical development activities, with the first Phase II study scheduled to start in 2022 in India.

Additional trials are planned in East Africa, which has the highest burden of visceral leishmaniasis.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a heredi tary blood condition that afflicts millions around the globe, particularly people of African descent, with sub Saharan Africa bearing roughly 80% of the disease burden.

Our commitment to addressing SCD includes a therapeutic pipeline as well as a holistic approach to diagnose, treat and manage the disease in sub Saharan Africa.

While the genetic cause of SCD has been known for decades, only recently has medical science gained the tools to potentially mitigate the biological effects of the errant gene that causes the disease.

We also are pursuing an ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell program for SCD, using CRISPR gene editing technology licensed from Intellia Therapeutics, and in 2021 we initiated patient dosing.

Also in 2021, Novartis announced a pioneering collaboration with the Bill Melinda Gates Founda tion to support the discovery of a single administration in vivo gene therapy to cure SCD, designed from the start to be practical for use in lower resourced settings.

Putting patients at the center of our clinical trials Engaging with patients and caregivers across the life cycle of our medicines is critically important to ensure we develop treatments that not only are safe and effective, but also truly address unmet medical needs.

The Novartis Commitment to Patients and Caregivers, launched in 2018, guides our teams across functions and divisions in ensuring patients have a voice in the research, development and commercialization of our medi cines.

We continue to roll out a systematic approach to patient engagement that covers the full development life cycle from early research to post launch.

In 2021, 57, or around 30%, of our clinical development programs had a patient engagement component, up from 44 in 2020.

Patients provided input on key aspects such as clinical study endpoints that matter to their disease, how to facilitate easier access to clinical trial sites, and how to enable remote trial participation.

We also integrated patient insights into early stage research: In 2021, 46 NIBR programs had a patient engagement component.

Patient engagement also enables us to streamline our clinical trials and bring our medicines to market more quickly.

For example, early input from patients in trial design can help us reduce the need for costly and time consuming protocol changes later in the development process while ensuring that the trial design is aligned with study participants’ needs and preferences.

In addition, we continue to help patients access medicines through our patient support and managed access programs.

Please see the section Build trust with society for more details.

In 2021, we engaged with 162 patient organizations across 48 disease areas to inform our decision making.

During the COVID 19 pandemic, the need for patient support grew while the income of patient organizations dropped, primarily due to the cancel lation of educational events and fundraising activities.

We provided funding to the community that was among other purposes used to strengthen digital communications tools and channels to help bridge these gaps.

In 2020, the latest year for which data is available, Novartis supported 1 248 patient organizations in 79 countries.

Please see the Novartis corporate website for more information.

We strive to include diverse patient populations in our clinical trials both to understand how patients who are most likely to be treated for a disease will respond to a medicine, and because it is the right thing to do.

We are working to address barriers to clinical trial participation, such as identifying sites where patients with a particular disease or condition may be located, identifying healthcare provid ers that treat underserved or under represented populations, and colla borating with researchers to enroll diverse populations in clinical trials.

In 2021, we published a Commitment to Diversity in Clinical Trials.

In the short term, we committed to evaluate diversity and inclusion principles for all our Phase III studies with US country participation.

In the longer term, we aim to expand this to all our global trials while leveraging data science and digital technology to track diversity data across our drug development programs.

In the US, health disparities affecting minority groups are endemic an issue that was highlighted and exacerbated by the COVID 19 pandemic.

Compared with non Hispanic whites, the Black and African American community has a lower life expectancy, a higher mortality rate from cancer, a greater likelihood of diseases such as asthma, and significantly increased rates of maternal and infant mortality.

Health inequity is also a particular challenge for the Black and African American community in medical schools and among physicians and clinical trial investigators in all three groups, Black and African Americans are proportion ally underrepresented.

In 2021, Novartis and the Novartis US Foundation announced plans to invest approximately USD 13.7 million to establish three research centers at Morehouse School of Medicine in Georgia, including a clinical trial center of excellence that could be a model for possible expansion to other historically Black colleges, universities and medical schools.

The investment is part of a 10 year commitment with Morehouse 26 historically Black colleges, universities and medical schools and other organizations.

The objective is to co create programs that address the root causes of systemic disparities in health outcomes and foster greater diversity, equity and inclusion across the R D ecosystem.

In addition, we are collaborating with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to support research investigating the link between genetic diversity across different regions in Africa and its potential impact on response to drug therapeutics.

With a combined funding commitment of GBP 2.8 million (USD 3.6 million) over five years, the project calls on African researchers to submit research proposals on the relevance of African genetic diversity to the treatment of malaria and tuberculosis.

Proposals selected for funding are expected to be announced in the first half of 2022.

From discovery to delivery, we work to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations.

These activities support our profitable growth and free up resources to invest in innovation for patients.

In everything we do, patient safety and product quality remain paramount.

Transforming manufacturing We are transforming our manufacturing operations to support our strategy while reducing the environmental footprint of our facilities.

Ensuring patient health and safety Patient health and safety is fundamental to our purpose.

Our activities are focused on three areas: product quality, pharmacovigilance and combating falsified medicines.

In our commercial operations, we aim to consistently deliver successful launches to support our financial performance and enable broad and rapid access to our medicines.

In 2021, launch brands and medicines we consider our key growth drivers1 contributed 52% of net sales in our Innovative Medicines Division, com pared with 44% in 2020.

By 2026, we expect approval of more than 20 pipeline assets with the potential to become blockbuster medicines with sales of more than USD 1 billion.

We have developed a launch roadmap to codify best practices.

For example, we start to prepare early more than three years before the anticipated launch date in many cases including talking with patients, physicians and payers to better understand their perspectives and needs.

In our Novartis Pharmaceuticals business unit, for example, around 80% of investment in medical affairs is now focused on the pre launch stage.

For Kesimpta, our treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS), we focused pre launch investment on three key markets: the US, Germany and China.

We deployed an unbranded digital information platform that reached up to 2 000 physicians in the US.

We also worked with patient advocacy groups to ensure their views were integrated into our launch prepara tions, and we talked to payers to understand their needs.

The preparations paid off: In the six months after launch in the US, we had reached 85% of our target customer base, most of them virtually, while around 20% of patients received Kesimpta as their first ever treatment for MS and more than 50% of patients received it as their first line treatment.

Kesimpta is approved in more than 60 countries worldwide.

Another example is Zolgensma, our gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) that reached USD 1.4 billion in sales in 2021.

Early patient identification through newborn screen ing programs and treatment aware ness are critical for SMA patients.

We work closely with stakeholders such as payers to highlight the importance of early treatment, and provide disease awareness programs for parents, physicians and other health profes sionals to spot the signs and symp toms of SMA.

In 2021, around 85% of new births in the US underwent screening for SMA, and we anticipate that the EU will have SMA screening in place for all new births by 2025.

Our pre launch preparations also found that achieving sustainable access to a one time gene therapy like Zolgensma in diverse markets such as Argentina and Egypt requires a menu of options to address the needs of stakeholders.

For example, our early access and Day One access agreements offer customiza ble options for payers including retroactive rebates, deferred pay ments, installment options and outcome based rebates and are designed to ensure that access is available to patients even before regulatory approval and formal national reimbursement agreements are in place.

In 2021, we had early access agreements in place in six markets, and pay for performance agreements in place in 16 markets.

The therapy was commercially available in over 40 countries.

Growth drivers include Cosentyx, Entresto, Xolair, Ilaris, Xiidra, Aimovig, Promacta Revolade, Ta nlar Mekinist, Kisqali, Lutathera, Kymriah and Jakavi (marketed by Novartis outside the US).

Meanwhile, in our Oncology business unit we leveraged more than 20 years of experience in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) to launch Scemblix, a new treatment option for patients that was approved in the US in 2021 for treatment of CML in two distinct indications.

Despite tremendous advances in CML treatment over the past decades, some patients struggle to meet treatment goals due to intolerance or inadequate response.

Before launch, we took steps to raise awareness of remaining unmet needs for CML patients.

Additionally, at the time of launch we estimate that more than 80% of US healthcare providers who treat CML were aware of the com pound and or its unique mechanism of action known in scientific litera ture as a STAMP inhibitor.

We antici pate approval in Japan and Europe during 2022.

We are also preparing for other launches in our oncology pipeline.

For example, we plan to enter the growing checkpoint inhibitor field with VDT482 (tislelizumab), an anti PD 1 monoclonal antibody that we in licensed in 2021 as part of an agree ment with an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd. We anticipate launch of VDT482 in second line esophageal squamous cell carcinoma the most common type of esophageal cancer globally in the US in mid 2022.

Looking further ahead, the need to extend survival for more patients with differ ent tumor types still exists.

We believe VDT482 has the potential for syner gistic combinations with other Novartis medicines to help address these unmet needs, and we have initiated three combinations in clinical trials and aim to advance several more within the next years.

The Novartis Technical Operations (NTO) organization, which manufac tures innovative medicines and Sandoz products, helps us to optimize resource allocation while ensuring quality across our 53 production sites worldwide.

NTO is split into different technology platforms with responsibil ity for large molecules, small mole cules, Sandoz products, cell and gene therapies, and ophthalmology and local market production.

In 2021, we continued to ensure a reliable supply of medicines to patients worldwide.

Our NTO employees supplied 71 billion treatments in 2021, broadly in line with the previous two years, while also supplying tens of millions of vaccine doses for COVID 19.

Novartis is helping produce COVID 19 vaccines at our facilities in Switzerland and Austria as part of our efforts to help end the pan demic and support the stability of global health systems.

Although Novartis no longer has a vaccines business, our many biologics products give us the capabilities to perform mRNA manufacturing and the final step of aseptically filling the vaccine into vials.

We prepared our facilities to do this task in only a few months a process that usually takes more than a year.

We produced 40 million doses of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine in 2021.

We also signed an agreement with Roche for the production at our Singapore site of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for Roche’s Actemra RoActemra , a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis that received emergency use authorization by the US FDA for the treatment of COVID 19 in hospitalized adults and children.

Our manufacturing operations also continue to evolve as we invest in new technologies and respond to the changing business environment.

In 2021, we started manufacturing our cholesterol lowering drug Leqvio at our Schaftenau drug production site in Austria.

Leqvio is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy that is approved in more than 50 countries.

We are also installing our first siRNA oligonu cleotide manufacturing facility at our Schweizerhalle site in Switzerland, which will produce the active ingredi ent of Leqvio.

In 2021, our production sites responded to sharply increased demand for some Novartis products in China after their inclusion on the country’s National Reimbursement Drug List made them available to more patients.

For exam ple, we responded to a significant increase in demand for Cosentyx and Ta nlar versus the previous year.

We are also pursuing a digital trans formation of our manufacturing operations with the aim of improved quality and greater efficiency.

For more details on how we are using digital technology and data analytics across the company, please see the section Go big on data and digital.

We continue to optimize our network of manufacturing sites worldwide, adjusting our production capacity to match our changing product mix.

In 2021, we announced plans to trans form 11 sites, including three that we plan to sell or close and one that we already sold.

We are working with employees affected by the changes to help them manage through the transition.

In addition, Novartis sites are on track to eliminate polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in secondary and tertiary packaging by the end of 2022.

For example, we now use a carton based packaging design for Aimovig, a migraine treatment.

For more on this topic, please see the section Build trust with society and our TCFD disclosure.

Patient safety is fundamental to our purpose: We cannot improve and extend people’s lives if we do not deliver safe, high quality medicines.

The importance of patient safety was highlighted in our 2021 materiality assessment, with both internal and external stakeholders identifying it as the most material topic.

Patient safety cuts across several strategic priorities for Novartis, including operational excellence and building trust with society.

Our activities are focused on three areas that span the life cycle of our medi cines and cover both our own opera tions and activities outside our walls: product quality, pharmacovigilance and combating falsified medicines.

Sustainability in manufacturing Our manufacturing facilities are central to our efforts to minimize our environmental footprint.

The majority of Novartis carbon emissions, water usage and waste in our own opera tions come from our production sites.

In 2021, efforts to reduce the environ mental footprint of our manufacturing sites contributed more than 10% of our overall reduction in carbon emissions (Scope 1 and 2) and more than 7% reduction in water consump tion, as well as more than 34% of waste reduction in our own operations.

We are investing in new technologies to make our manufacturing processes more resource efficient.

For example, an upgrade to the solvent process at our Kundl site in Austria led to a reduc tion of 8 500 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually.

Our site in Huningue, France, reduced 19% of its annual energy consumption equivalent to 1 600 tons of CO2 through a more energy efficient system.

A site in Turkey used a filtration system to cut water consumption by 14%.

All manufacturing sites are required to treat process water according to local legal requirements before it is returned to the environment.

Novartis facilities and priority suppliers are included in our PiE (Pharmaceuticals in the Environment) program to assess their effluent load of active pharma ceutical ingredients (APIs) in water streams against internal standards and requirements from the AMR Industry Alliance framework a private sector coalition providing sustainable solu tions to curb antimicrobial resistance.

Potential impacts on water quality from the use of our products downstream in the value chain are considered part of the marketing authorization approval process.

We maintain a robust quality manage ment system for the production of marketed products and investigational medicines, in full compliance with requirements from health authorities and other regulators around the world.

We hold relevant manufacturing licenses and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certificates for 100% of our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations.

These are issued after inspections by external health authorities such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the World Health Organization (WHO) and Swissmedic.

We hold relevant ISO certifications for the manufacture of medical devices.

Of 126 inspections of our facilities by health authorities around the world in 2021, all but one (99.2%) were found to be acceptable without major findings.

For the one inspection that required further improvement, a corrective action plan was deemed acceptable by the relevant health authority (EMA).

Of the 126 inspec tions, 31 were performed remotely, and one FDA inspection relied on a prior inspection conducted by the Austrian healthcare authorities under a mutual recognition agreement.

We also have a strong auditing program covering both our own operations and those of our suppliers.

All but six audits were found to be acceptable (99.1%).

One of the audits that required further improvement was at our own site due to unretrievable source data from a legacy system that is set to be decommissioned and replaced by the end of 2021.

The other audits with opportunities for improvement were at external suppliers with corrective actions in progress.

We conduct thorough investigations when any deviations from current GMPs or other relevant regulations occur, or when we detect out of speci fication results or any other failures in our manufacturing processes.

Inci dents are assessed by subject matter experts and conclusions are provided to the appropriate health authorities with relevant documentation.

Actions such as recalls are executed in agree ment with the relevant authorities.

We also monitor our medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines and completed all necessary nitrosa mine assessments in 2021, closely following the recently agreed EMA FDA implementation plan for the pharmaceutical industry.

We have a robust quality and safety training process for employees and third parties.

We require all employees involved in manufacturing, supply and distribution to undergo at least two annual training sessions on quality standards.

Employees can take additional training relevant to their role or worksite.

We are regularly audited on our training procedures.

We look for ways to strengthen and streamline our quality processes to improve efficiency and bring our medicines to patients faster.

This includes the use of digital technology and remote work across our quality operations, a trend that has been accelerated by the COVID 19 pan demic.

For example, in 2021 we rolled out paperless quality control at three sites, including in Torre Annunziata, Italy, and in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

For more on this topic, please see the Novartis quality management system section of our corporate website.

Novartis continues its efforts to boost pharmacovigilance capabilities to support patient safety worldwide.

While clinical trials provide important information on a medicine’s safety during development, it is only after its use in greater numbers of patients in real world settings that some adverse events become known.

Effective pharmacovigilance requires activities to educate patients, providers and pharmacists, and strengthen reporting of adverse events to the company.

Our pharmacovigilance and falsified medicines teams also work closely together, for example in cases where a disproportionate number of adverse events may indicate the presence of suspected falsified medicines.

All third parties providing services or products manufactured to good practice standards are required to have their own quality assurance department and a formal training process.

Novartis routinely assesses the capability and effectiveness of third party training programs during audits to confirm suitability for the provided service or product.

We maintain a high level of compli ance to regulatory requirements for both individual case safety reports and periodic benefit risk assess ments.

In addition, in 2021 an internal audit confirmed the strength of the Novartis integrated pharmacovigi lance governance model after it obtained ISO 9001 certification in the previous year.

With a growing number of medical devices in the Novartis portfolio, we have also built a robust system to monitor adverse events associated with medical devices worldwide.

Novartis was the first company certified for compliance with the European Medical Devices Regulation, which came into force in 2021.

As a complement to traditional pharmacovigilance methods, we increasingly use technologies such as process automation, machine learning and natural language processing to analyze multiple data sources for adverse events.

Novartis collaborates with pharma covigilance associations and authori ties in multiple countries, including Italy, the Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, China and India, to support the implementation of local and international guidelines as well as the implementation of new adverse event reporting submission methods.

Further examples of our capacity building initiatives in 2021 included training for clinical trial investigators in Mexico and China, as well as support for the creation of a local organization for pharmacovigilance professionals in the Philippines.

In Asia, Novartis participated in regional forums where we presented our pharmacovigilance approach for advanced technology platforms, such as cell and gene therapies, while in Latin America we worked with partners to support them in reporting adverse events under different scenarios of the COVID 19 pandemic.

In response to the COVID 19 pan demic, we set up a task force to ensure the continuity of our pharma covigilance system while providing support to healthcare professionals.

We applied a pragmatic approach that created efficiencies across some of our processes such as the Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) follow up.

We estimate that the ICSR efficiency gain translated into 2 500 saved hours for healthcare professionals at a critical time.

Worldwide patient safety offices contri buted with safety data collection on COVID 19 investigator initiated trials to support assessments about the impact of the new virus.

The Pharmaceutical Security Institute reported a 38% increase in incidents of falsified medicines from 2016 to 2020, a trend that has been exacerbated by increased demand for medicines amid the COVID 19 pandemic.

At Novartis, our priority is to protect patient health and safety through quick authentication and reporting of falsified medicines to health authori ties and the WHO. Since 2017, our efforts have helped prevent falsified medicines from reaching and harming more than 1.6 million patients.

In 2021, close collaboration with local law enforcement led to the investiga tion of 318 incidents in 41 countries, 66 successful enforcement actions, and the seizure of 1 million units of falsified medicines as well as the removal of more than 10 100 illicit advertisements from online platforms.

Digital technology is a critical part of our efforts to quickly authenticate falsified medicines.

In 2021, we made significant progress on three intercon nected digital solutions.

Authenti eld by Novartis is a cost effective mobile spectrometric sensor that can reduce the time needed to authenticate suspect medicines from several weeks to a maximum of five days.

By early 2023, we aim to train 1 000 end users and deploy 500 sensors in 96 countries across 100 high risk products in our portfolio.

Another project is MoVe, a mobile platform that enables Novartis employees to quickly verify the authenticity of secondary packaging for any product.

The solution was in use in 24 countries by the end of 2021.

Finally, Novartis continued to lead an initiative with the Innovative Medicines Initiative and 12 major pharmaceutical companies to develop a use case for blockchain technology in the pharma ceutical supply chain.

The aim is to empower patients to check their own medicines for authenticity while generating data backed by robust privacy controls on trends in falsi fied medicines.

Fast authentication needs to be supported by timely reporting.

Novartis has a policy to report all confirmed incidents of falsified medicines to the WHO within 10 days.

Our efforts have been recognized as a best practice by the Access to Medicine Foundation.

In 2021, Novartis was among the first pharma ceutical companies to join the WHO’s new online reporting platform for falsified medicines incidents.

We also engage with public and private stakeholders, such as the WHO and the Organization for Economic Co operation and Develop ment, to encourage coordinated action and promote effective policy making on falsified medicines.

In 2021, we delivered over 150 engagements and reached over 7 200 stakeholders in 14 countries.

We are committed to working with third parties who operate in a manner that is consistent with our values and ethical principles.

While interactions with third parties at Novartis are broadly defined by our Third Party Code, we identify, assess, monitor and mitigate risk associated with suppliers through our Third Party Risk Manage ment (TPRM) framework.

Implemented globally across Novartis in 2019, our TPRM process promotes ethical behavior and fosters sustaina bility across our supply chain by addressing risk areas such as anti bribery animal welfare health, safety and environment (HSE) labor rights information security and data privacy.

We conduct risk assessments for all new eligible suppliers and new products, services or sites from existing suppliers.

Not all suppliers trigger a detailed risk assessment.

In 2021, we assessed 12 064 suppli ers through our TPRM process, up from 8 448 in 2020.

We agreed on remediation actions with 912 suppli ers, and we stopped engagements with 37 suppliers due to the risk assessment results.

We audited 85 suppliers, a significant increase from the previous year as the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic eased in several countries.

In 2021, we took steps to increase the efficiency of our TPRM process and align it more closely to our overall view of risk at Novartis, while main taining a high level of assurance.

For example, we started to prioritize all third parties in scope by risk severity.

As part of this process, we de scoped two risk areas financial due diligence and business continuity since the former is already embed ded in other process steps while the latter is covered by default within other risk areas.

For example, current manual risk assessments for distribu tors and wholesalers will be gradually incorporated into an automated TPRM process, ensuring a standardized and auditable practice around the world.

To reach our emissions reduction targets, we are working with our suppliers to help them apply, where possible, the same high standards of environmental sustainability as we do.

By 2025, we aim to include environ mental sustainability criteria as part of all supplier contracts.

In our manufacturing operations, we are working with key suppliers to set baselines and targets for CO2 emis sions, water consumption and waste management, as well as confirm the API content of manufacturing effluents.

We are jointly developing sustainability roadmaps by focusing on product spe cific technology action plans.

Suppliers are also expected to report annually on progress and implement remedia tion plans where needed.

We are also engaging our commercial suppliers, with a focus on those with the largest contribution to our carbon footprint.

In 2021, we published the Novartis Green Expectations from Suppliers engagement framework.

Our top 100 suppliers are expected to commit to emissions reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and regularly report on their environmental impact management and achievements through CDP.

Meanwhile, we organ ized a Green Supplier Summit to discuss environmental sustainability challenges and potential solutions with our commercial suppliers.

CTS has around 12 000 em ployees located in over 40 countries and across five global service centers, with offerings spanning technology, facilities, finance, human resources, procurement, consulting, data science and artificial intelligence (AI).

Also in 2021, we worked with Schneider Electric and nine major pharmaceuti cal companies through an initiative called Energize to accelerate the adoption of renewable electricity in our shared supply chains in the US and Europe.

We also provide guidance and tools to our manufacturing suppliers on water quality topics, including a tailored mass balance calculator to identify and quantify APIs in wastewater.

Key focus areas include upgrading and simplifying our global enterprise resource planning systems.

This multiyear project, which started in 2020, will help Novartis leverage digital technology at an even greater scale.

The goal is to significantly simplify our core processes, capabili ties and systems to provide greater flexibility and support to our business operations.

CTS teams are also helping to simplify the employee experience at Novartis.

For example, we have introduced an AI based virtual assistant to support employees with technology and human resource related queries.

The tool will be expanded in the coming years to include all other functions.

We are also accelerating the use of technologies such as cognitive robotic process automation to improve productivity, enhance remote assis tance, and enable employees to focus their time on high impact tasks.

For example, more than 1 million transac tions that account for 75 000 hours of manual, repetitive work in functions such as human resources, finance and drug development are now done in a fraction of the time through AI enabled automation.

For more on this topic, please see the section Build trust with society and our TCFD disclosure.

Since 2018, we have transformed business services at Novartis to better enable our people to execute on our strategy and deliver on our purpose.

Through these efforts, we have improved productivity and user satis faction while reducing our cost base and expanding our service offerings.

In 2021, we made further progress by creating a new organization called Customer Technology Solutions (CTS), which combines the global scale of our business services func tions with the transformative nature of our enterprise digital teams.

The aim is to deliver services and solutions that drive value across Novartis and enable the transformation of our enterprise.

Over the next several years, CTS is expected to continue to improve productivity to drive profitable growth.

We are reimagining medicine using the power of data science and digital technology.

With tools like artificial intelligence (AI), we’re opening new paths to treat disease while finding new ways to engage customers, support patients and streamline our operations.

Accelerating innovation Novartis aspires to be an industry leader in applying data science and digital technologies to the challenge of discovering new medicines.

By enhancing assets in our pipeline through data and digital, we aim to improve patient outcomes, streamline the development process, and sup port diverse, inclusive trials.

One example is the use of digital devices, such as wearable sensors, to capture continuous data on physical activity, sleep quality or fatigue, which could be used as endpoints in trials for diseases including chronic obstruc tive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Sj gren’s syndrome.

Such digital endpoints can improve the relevance and objectivity of clinical trial data, as well as offer new insights.

In our chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) programs, for example, we are using a wearable digital sensor as an exploratory endpoint to pilot the early detection of serious side effects like cytokine release syndrome in outpatient settings.

In 2021, digital endpoints were used in 16 Novartis trials, with plans to add more in the coming years.

Digital technology can also make clinical trials more convenient for patients and caregivers by reducing the need for repeated in person clinic visits.

For example, in a Phase III study of our gene therapy Zolgensma in older children with spinal muscular atrophy, parents can upload videos of their child’s progress remotely from home.

We are taking advantage of a key resource vast amounts of data that once existed in silos at Novartis to improve productivity and spur innova tion.

In 2021, Novartis received a healthcare Eye on Innovation award from Gartner for our success in bringing this data together on a foundational, enterprise wide data and analytics platform that includes more than 100 solutions and covers the life cycle of our business.

One example is data42, which makes data from more than 2 700 clinical trials over two decades, as well as data from real world settings, availa ble to data scientists and researchers across Novartis.

This advanced analytics platform makes it possible to discover connections in our data, identify relevant patient populations, and test hypotheses on a previously unimaginable scale all with the aim of finding more treatments and getting them to patients faster.

Patient data in data42 is anonymized and protected by a robust clinical data access policy, and users are granted access only after receiving training.

We are currently expanding data42 by adding more preclinical data.

In 2021, data42 was used by more than 900 employees working on around 300 projects.

These include efforts to better understand disease progression, optimize treatments and improve clinical trial design.

For example, for an analysis in COPD, researchers can include data from patients in a heart failure trial who have COPD in their medical history or as an adverse event.

For the first time, data scientists and researchers can also view the gender balance across all Novartis trials, sorted by disease area, indication and country.

These insights help us design future trials with more emphasis on diversity and inclusion.

Our investments in technology also helped keep our clinical trials on track during the COVID 19 pandemic.

For example, more than 3 000 partici pants across nine clinical trials were referred through an online enrollment portal, after more than 15 000 poten tial participants completed an online trial qualification questionnaire.

In one Phase II trial, digital recruitment contributed over 25% of the cohort of randomized patients.

We used another digital tool to forecast COVID 19 case progression and anticipate disruptions to clinical trials.

In one trial, for instance, we identified potential delays of up to several months in patient enrollment and first visits related to specific locations.

By redirecting resources to compensate, we reduced this gap to a few weeks.

In other trials, we switched to remote solutions such as home nursing and home delivery of the investigational medicine.

The Novartis AI Innovation Center (AI Lab), a collaboration with Microsoft, continues to scale a range of solutions to improve productivity in early research through to product launch.

For example, the AI Lab developed a platform that assists medicinal chem ists in optimizing molecular structures of promising molecules, enabling faster compound design and selection.

Also in partnership with Microsoft, we rolled out a new AI platform to help simplify and streamline some of our processes.

In 2021, it was used by employees responsible for formulation development and early manufacturing of investigational medicines.

The platform is improving efficiency by connecting data sets and leveraging information from thousands of past formulations, and is expected to yield cost savings of several million dollars per year.

We plan to expand the platform to other areas in our R D operations.

Novartis saved over USD 14 million from 2018 to 2021 by deploying BenchSci, an AI platform that derives actionable knowledge from scientific publications.

Scientists at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) use BenchSci to select the best antibody and other key reagents for their work, avoiding costly and unproductive experimental dead ends.

BenchSci has helped accelerate projects by months, while also deliver ing novel scientific insights.

We also work with academic organiza tions in areas of mutual scientific interest.

For example, a collaboration with the Oxford Big Data Institute uses AI to generate insights from a multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical data set containing brain MRI scans and other data from approximately 35 000 patients.

The data set includes up to 15 years of follow up for some patients.

The project has already yielded peer reviewed publications and will generate further insights on long term disease progression and prognosis of MS patients.

We continue to invest in digital tools to provide personalization and better experiences for customers.

These include AI powered digital assistants to optimize the content, timing and method of communications with physicians based on their preferences.

For example, a tool used by our Medical Affairs function provides data insights to 685 field based medical science liaisons in 28 countries, helping to personalize their engage ments with healthcare professionals.

Such tools are part of a broader initiative to tailor information to the needs of healthcare professionals.

This enterprise wide, multiyear effort uses data insights to provide relevant information to physicians at the right time, through preferred channels, and at a frequency that best meets their needs helping to improve the quality of our commercial and medical affairs interactions.

In the US, commercial teams working on Cosentyx, Promacta and our portfolio of breast cancer medicines are using predictive analytics and machine learning to determine the most effective mix of face to face and digital communications to healthcare professionals a personalized approach that has led to increased customer engagement.

We aim to scale it to additional countries, including Germany and China.

We are expanding patient focused digital health solutions in key markets.

This includes the cardiovascular disease app AI Nurse in China, which was developed in collaboration with Tencent.

For more information, please see Improving heart health in China on the following page.

Another patient focused solution is our clinically validated, AI powered symptom checker for difficult to diag nose conditions such as psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis, a chronic inflammatory disease that can take up to five years to diagnose.

Patients enter their symptoms through a website that provides a detailed report that can be shared with their doctor.

The site also gives links to disease information, details about local specialists and, in some cases, a telemedicine consultation.

At the end of 2021, users had completed more than 53 000 assessments.

Over 12 100 had symptoms consistent with psoriatic arthritis or axial spondyloar thritis, and approximately 2 300 took follow up actions.

Appendices scope of the partnership has been expanded to include psoriasis, familial Mediterranean fever and Still’s disease across 13 markets.

We are also scaling projects through the Novartis Biome, a global network of innovation hubs that works with external partners on digital solutions across all aspects of our strategy.

OdySight, for example, is a smart phone game that encourages patients with chronic eye diseases such as age related macular degeneration to monitor any deterioration in their vision.

OdySight provides insights to doctors, enabling them to make earlier interventions and improve patient outcomes.

Developed in France in collaboration with a startup called Tilak Healthcare, OdySight is now helping patients in six countries.

In 2021, we added five Novartis Biome hubs in Germany, Spain, Brazil, Singapore and sub Saharan Africa, expanding the total network to 11 locations.

Digital solutions for global health One of the first companies to partner with the Novartis Biome was Hemex Health, which developed a small, automated testing device already approved for use in Ghana to quickly detect genetic blood disorders such as sickle cell disease.

The Novartis Biome is now working with Hemex Health on an extensive research implementation study to support expanded use of the device in primary care settings in sub Saharan Africa, which carries 80% of the global disease burden.

We continued to work on an initiative co founded by Novartis that aims to strengthen the foundations of digital healthcare systems in low and middle income countries (LMICs).

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in China.

AI Nurse is a digital health app, developed in collaboration with Tencent, that leverages the WeChat social media platform to make it easier for patients with heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases to manage disease progression.

Hospitals enroll patients with the AI Nurse app after treatment for a cardiac event.

Upon discharge, patients send regular updates to their doctor via an AI enabled chatbot, which provides medication reminders and recommendations for diet and exercise.

The app alerts the doctor to signs of deterioration, helping to determine if follow up care is needed.

At the end of 2021, usage of AI Nurse had grown to more than 300 000 patients, from around 20 000 in the prior year.

More than 5 000 healthcare professionals and over 1 000 hospitals in at least 200 cities across China are using AI Nurse.

We are in the process of expanding AI Nurse to hypertension (high blood pressure).

Patients using AI Nurse compared with around 20 000 in the prior year and respectful of human rights in our use of AI.

We created these guidelines in collaboration with leading ethicists from the International Bioethics Advisory Committee, and specialists in AI and data privacy.

The position outlines our commitment to data privacy, security, accountability and environmental sustainability.

We are taking steps to integrate these principles across the organization.

We have robust governance, policies and systems in place to ensure the security of our data and IT systems, including Board level oversight of cybersecurity through the Risk Committee, and management level responsibility through our Chief Information Security Officer.

Novartis did not experience any material cyber security incidents in 2021.

To prevent system interruptions, we have business continuity plans that we test at least every six months.

We conduct internal vulnerability analyses as well as external testing via a third party to ensure the effectiveness of our controls.

The Novartis Global Information Management Policy is available to all employees via the Novartis intranet.

We include cybersecurity in our Code of Ethics commitments and require suppliers to implement organizational security policies and standards.

Together with our partners, we are adding disease metadata packages for our global health flagship programs to DHIS2, along with other enhance ments, to enable countries to further reduce supply chain bottlenecks and improve access to medicine.

Novartis teams are using the system to support our malaria programs as well.

In addition, we launched a partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise to accelerate the use of data and digital technologies for global health solu tions.

The first use case is a disease surveillance platform for dengue fever, which the World Health Organization has listed as a top 10 global health threat.

For more information about how we address global heath chal lenges, please see the section Build trust with society.

We use technology to drive greater efficiency and cost savings across our operations.

For example, a platform in our manufacturing operations called SpotOn Insights Center provides multiple digital solutions to help maximize economy of scale, reduce throughput times and optimize inventories.

One of these solutions already helps 18 production sites to optimize finished goods supply chains for more than 400 of our products.

In addition, we are automating core operational processes at scale by deploying robot cognitive automation also known as bots across our Customer Technology Solutions organization.

One example is an intelligent assistant that automates large parts of the writing of medical reports.

Bots are also helping to resolve (either partially or fully) approximately 80% of user requests to our enterprise wide IT helpdesk.

We promote training opportunities to develop digital skills among our employees.

We have expanded our data science training and mentoring programs, which we launched in 2020.

We have also invested in a learning platform for data science coding skills, which has been used by over 850 employees who spent a total of over 11 000 hours on the platform in 2021.

For more examples of our progress in building digital skills across Novartis, please see the section Unleash the power of our people.

In 2021, we completed the rollout of a new data management process covering the entire data life cycle to accelerate our digital transforma tion while ensuring data privacy.

The new process spans nearly 5 million data sets, covering functions includ ing R D, finance, operations and pro curement.

Each domain has a data owner who is responsible for making their data available to the enterprise with the right quality and traceability, while also ensuring correct usage.

These leaders are working together to unify data govern ance and processes across the organization and ensure that data is a strategic reusable asset for the company.

The use of new technologies such as AI creates new ethical questions, including how to avoid biases in data.

We are transforming our culture to empower each employee to be inspired by our purpose and drive innovation.

We are creating an environment that supports diversity and the freedom to be our authentic selves, while providing the flexibility to deliver our best work.

In this section  Evolving ways of working In a changing working environment, we are giving employees and teams the flexibility to optimize their performance.

Supporting and protecting our employees Novartis provides a range of benefits, including paid parental leave.

We also continue to protect our employees amid the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic.

Our employees are critical to fulfilling our purpose of reimagining medicine to improve and extend people’s lives.

We depend on the skills and creativity of our people to develop and produce new medicines, and deliver them to patients.

Our aspiration is for every employee to feel inspired by our purpose, be curious about new ideas, and work in an unbossed environment that encourages teamwork, initiative and innovation.

In 2021, we made progress in trans forming our culture to attract and retain the best talent to support our strategy.

Amid the COVID 19 pandemic, we explored new working models that allow employees to maximize their performance.

We continued to promote digital skills across the organization and reached more leaders with our flagship leadership development program, while becom ing a more diverse, equitable and inclusive organization.

The score for engagement in our quarterly employee survey stood at 78 in Q4 2021, compared to 80 in Q4 2020.

The latest score was 5 points higher than the industry benchmark and was broadly consistent across genders, with scores of 78 for men and 79 for women.

Engagement favorability, which measures the percentage of agree or strongly agree survey responses, was 86% in the fourth quarter, compared with 87% a year earlier.

In 2021, we continued to score highly in environmental, social and govern ance (ESG) ratings on human capital.

For example, Novartis improved its performance in the S P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, with strong ESG scores achieved in the areas of human capital develop ment, labor practices, and talent attraction and retention.

COVID 19 has reshaped the global working environment.

In an internal survey, more than three quarters of Novartis employees said they wanted to continue with a mix of office based and remote working post pandemic consistent with external trends.

In this environment, we embarked on a multiyear program called Choice with Responsibility to explore new working models.

The aim is to give employees greater flexibility in how they work to optimize their well being and performance while maintaining a focus on productivity and innovation.

As part of this program, we continued a policy introduced in 2020 for employees to choose how, when and where they work within their country (and in the US, within their state) of employment, in alignment with their teams to ensure a continued focus on collaboration and innovation.

Choice with Responsibility applies to all employees, but we recognize there is a wide diversity of roles within the organization.

Some production work and laboratory research, for example, may not allow as much flexibility as other roles.

The choices about how, when and where people work will therefore be different based on their role the nature of the team and health, safety and legal regulatory requirements.

During 2021, we conducted around 70 local and global experiments involving a total of 25 000 employees, which are giving clarity on the path forward.

The results will provide the basis for our ways of working in the future.

For example, 500 employees in 15 countries took part in a three month experiment to understand and address the challenges of moving to a virtual environment.

The results showed 70% of participants prefer a hybrid arrange ment in which their time is divided between their home and workplace.

Meanwhile, teams that determined their own solutions on how to work together felt more able to collaborate and manage their workload compared with teams that had not, leading to an overall feeling of Novartis having improved as a place to work.

In 2021, we continued expanding our global program to help employees manage their physical, mental and social well being.

All 20 000 Novartis leaders and 2 189 other employees took part in an e learning program to enhance their well being, while 57 001 people visited a How are you feel ing webpage with resources to help them manage stress and other topics.

In addition, 14 257 employees attended workshops during a well being month, with 96% of attendees saying they would apply learnings in their daily work.

Meanwhile, two third party smartphone apps provided by Novartis were used by 32 709 employees to increase self aware ness and develop positive habits in areas including movement, nutrition, recovery and mindset, which are important for holistic well being.

In another important change, we transformed our approach to perfor mance management and development by replacing annual performance ratings with a flexible, continuous system of coaching, feedback and recognition by managers and col leagues.

Teams and individuals create objectives that include a focus on longer term impact over several years.

In addition, managers and employees have regular discussions on topics including progress toward goals, devel opment, feedback and well being.

In 2021, we continued to focus on promoting a culture of curiosity and learning.

This was the third year of our Go Big on Learning initiative, which involves a USD 100 million investment in addition to the normal annual training budget of USD 200 million.

Our aspiration is for every internal employee to spend 100 hours a year on learning.

We achieved an average of 52.1 training hours per internal employee in 2021, broadly in line with the previous year.

Our focus on learning and develop ment is being recognized by current and prospective employees.

The score for learning engagement and growth in the OurVoice survey remained at an all time high of 75 in 2021, compared to an industry benchmark of 71.

In addition, opportunities for learning and career growth were cited by successful applicants as a leading reason for wanting to join Novartis.

Learning requirements reflected the change to more flexible working practices as well as greater demand for digital skills to support our strat egy.

Across both LinkedIn Learning and Coursera, we registered a total of more than 47 000 active users and more than 105 000 courses completed in 2021.

We also main tained access to the Coursera friends and family program for 15 000 users.

Approximately 16 000 employees used a digital awareness hub to enhance their knowledge and skills in data science, artificial intelligence (AI) and related areas.

In 2021, training related to digital skills more than doubled from the previous year, based on an analysis provided by Coursera.

Novartis was ahead of the industry benchmark in data analysis and other areas, according to Coursera.

Furthermore, we launched a new learning platform for 10 000 employ ees, primarily in our commercial operations, that uses AI to customize learning on digital skills based on an individual’s role and daily activities.

The idea behind unbossed is that people are most creative and productive when they are empowered to pursue their ideas.

We want Novartis leaders to provide clarity and accountability for their teams, remove obstacles, and empower others to reach their potential.

In 2021, more than 5 000 leaders took part in a development program called the Unbossed Leadership Experience (ULE), which provides them with the skills needed to drive our cultural transformation in an environment conducive to personal growth.

We are now nearly halfway to meeting our ambition of bringing ULE to all 20 000 leaders at Novartis.

In an employee survey, teams reporting to senior leaders who completed the program showed higher results for engagement (3.8 percentage points), empowerment (2.9 1 Placeholder for footnote to explain change in learning hours data methodology percentage points), and feeling safe to speak up (3.6 percentage points) compared with the company benchmark.

Teams working closely with ULE leaders were also more comfortable with experimentation and potential failure, according to a separate feedback process, suggesting they are becoming more open to innovation.

The platform, which will be rolled out to the full Novartis organization in 2022, is intended to build new skills and capabilities to support our enterprise data and digital strategy.

In addition, we launched pilots involv ing around 15 000 people for two AI powered platforms that give employees access to resources for career planning, learning and mentor ing, as well as opportunities to join short term projects to develop new skills.

The aim is to help employees navigate their careers and build the skills they need to succeed at Novartis.

We seek to create a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment that provides equal opportunities for all employees and where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.

We do this not only because it is right, but also because it helps to generate new ideas and brings us closer to the diverse perspectives of patients and other stakeholders.

We recognize that everyone plays a part in building an inclusive environment, and in 2021, 97% of our employees completed the first global e training on diversity and inclusion (D I).

A key element of our D I strategy is gender equity, and we made progress in 2021 toward our Equal Pay Interna tional Coalition (EPIC) pledge to achieve gender balance in manage ment and improve pay equity and transparency processes by 2023.

The percentage of women in manage ment increased to 46% in 2021 from 45% in 2020.

Based on the latest data available as of December 31, 2020, Novartis has a global median pay gap of 2.3% and a global mean pay gap of 3.3%, compared with 3.1% and 3.6%, respectively, in the prior year.

While we acknowledge this percentage is influenced by worldwide workforce demographics, this is significantly ahead of the Bloomberg benchmarks of 19% median and 21% mean for the same period.

In 2021, we achieved external pay transparency in a further 10 countries, including Switzerland and the US, bringing the total to 16 countries.

We continue to extend this initiative, through which employees can com pare their pay to external bench marks, and by February 2022 we expect pay transparency to cover more than 50 000 employees across 33 countries.

We have eliminated historical salary data from 80% of global hiring to reduce the risk of gender bias when making job offers.

We are taking steps to apply this to every job offer world wide by 2023.

Novartis was the first global pharma ceutical company to support the United Nations Standards of Conduct for Business to tackle discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI) employees.

In 2021, we distributed an updated guide for employees and managers to support employees in gender transitioning.

We are working to include coverage for gender dysphoria, the condition in which someone feels a strong desire to change gender, in Novartis com pany healthcare plans, where possi ble.

We continued our senior sponsor ship program for LGBTQI employees with reverse mentoring for partici pants, including two members of the Executive Committee of Novartis.

We recognize the need to provide an environment where people with disabilities can perform at their best.

In 2021, we developed a strategy and solutions to involve them fully in the workplace and ensure they have the same opportunities as everyone at Novartis.

This was done in conjunction with external partners, including the International Labor Organization’s Global Business and Disability Net work the Center for Disability and Integration at the University of St.

Gallen and The Valuable 500, a group of global organizations putting disabil ity on their leadership agenda.

Novartis is committed to promoting racial equity both inside and outside the company.

In 2021, we announced a 10 year collaboration with 26 historically Black colleges, universities and medical schools in the US to address the causes of disparity in healthcare.

For more information, see the section Deliver transformative innovation.

We encourage employees with shared interests, experiences and back grounds to form voluntary communi ties called Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which give them a forum to network with peers and ensure their perspectives are recognized.

There are more than 80 such ERGs at Novartis, including for LGBTQI employees, working parents, employees with disabilities, and other groups.

Our progress in building a diverse and inclusive environment was recognized externally: Novartis was included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the third year in a row.

Where possible, Novartis provides benefits to all full and part time employees.

These vary between countries but generally include comprehensive health, well being and retirement benefits generous vaca tion policies and a global recognition program.

Our enterprise and digital training programs are generally available to all employees regardless of contract type.

All Novartis employees worldwide are eligible for a minimum 14 weeks of paid parental leave on the birth or adoption of a child, effective from their first day of employment.

A total of 4 632 people took advantage of this benefit during the year, based on data that was available for 33 coun tries covering 63% of our employee population.

Of the total employees taking parental leave, 59% were female and 41% were male.

In 2021, Novartis launched an Employee Share Purchase Plan, which enables employees to voluntarily purchase Novartis shares at a dis counted price.

The plan is global in scope: The first phase of its four year rollout, starting in 2021, covers North America (the US, Puerto Rico and Canada), with subsequent waves in other countries and regions starting in 2022, 2023 and 2024.

All permanent employees are eligible for the plan (with certain exceptions).

In 2021, we took further steps to protect the health and safety of employees as the impact of COVID 19 continued to be felt worldwide.

In countries where sufficient vaccines were available and where the guidance was in line with local laws and regulations we asked employ ees to only come on site if they were either fully vaccinated or fully recov ered from COVID 19 within the previous six months.

Local manage ment could decide to adjust these principles based on the local regula tions and in country situation.

COVID 19 test results could also be accepted as a means to access sites if deemed appropriate by the local management team.

When on site, employees were asked to continue to adhere to safety and hygiene measures, with an emphasis on closely following the rules introduced in 2020.

Meanwhile, we made the Everbridge global emergency communications tool available to 160 000 Novartis employees as well as chosen partners and suppliers in 2021.

This provided advance warning of any security, health or environmental risks that could affect employees, whether working on site, at home, or in other remote locations.

In 2021, we continued to strengthen our engagement and volunteering program, building on 25 years of Novartis employees giving back to the communities in which we operate.

We have shifted our focus from a single day of community activity each year to long term partnerships that are aligned with our strategy and where our support can have a sustain able impact.

Since 2015, the program’s virtual platform has been used by a total of 23 346 employees in more than 60 countries, with activities ranging from on the ground projects to virtual volunteering from home.

Employees are empowered to share their skills and experience in a way that best suits their interests and availability with no specific time limits on activities.

Volunteering programs during 2021 included the US President’s Malaria Initiative, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Save the Children, Last Mile Health, The Max Founda tion, and the Tropical Health and Education Trust.

We began a partnership with the International Rescue Committee in which Novartis volunteers supported 22 refugees, migrants and asylum seekers to sustain small businesses in the US. We also engaged with the Tent Partnership for Refugees and committed to provide 50 mentoring opportunities for LGBTQI refugees in the US, Germany and the UK over the next three years.

In addition, we are preparing to launch in early 2022 a new digital tool that matches the needs of our partners with the skills and interests of our employees.

Going forward, this will enable us to better measure the impact of our volunteering activities.

Our long term success depends on building and maintaining trust with society.

We strive to meet the expectations of our stakeholders by making our medicines available to as many people as possible, by acting ethically, and by making a positive difference for society while minimizing our environmental impact.

In this section  Leading the way on access and global health Improving access to medicines remains one of the world’s greatest healthcare needs.

We seek to expand access to underserved patient populations while addressing major global health challenges.

Holding ourselves to high ethical standards Our stakeholders expect us to act with high ethical standards wherever we operate.

We are making progress in embedding ethics and human rights across our company.

Leading the way on access and global health members of the Executive Committee of Novartis have access metrics in their annual performance objectives.

Improving access to medicines remains one of the world’s greatest healthcare challenges.

At Novartis, we know that building trust with society depends not only on finding new treatments but also on making them available to as many people as possible.

Our 2021 materiality assessment identified access as one of our most material topics.

We seek to expand access to our medicines to underserved patient populations in both developed and developing countries, while address ing major global health challenges.

We reached 56.2 million patients in 2021 through access approaches, and we have set ambitious targets to reinforce our commitments.

The Access to Medicine Foundation has recognized our efforts in this area, ranking us second in the 2021 Access to Medicine Index among 20 of the world’s largest healthcare companies.

We aim to implement an access strategy for all new medicines launched.

These strategies include innovative pricing and access models, earlier launches in low and middle income countries (LMICs), and approaches to strengthen healthcare systems.

Information in this chapter on access and global health is organ ized according to the three pillars of the Novartis access principles (see infographic below).

R D: We systematically assess our product portfolio against the unmet needs of underserved populations and integrate these needs, as appropriate, into our drug discovery and development strategy.

We aim to make our products available in countries with the highest burden of the disease to be treated.

Affordability: We aim to price our medicines based on the value they deliver to patients, healthcare systems and society.

We work to make our medicines available by adopting innovative access and pricing models, taking into account local income levels, affordability barriers and economic realities.

System strengthening: We work with governments and other partners to lower barriers to healthcare delivery and support quality patient care in areas where we can have the greatest impact.

Our targets for access and global health In 2020, Novartis committed to increase patient reach with our strate gic innovative therapies in LMICs by at least 200% by 2025 (vs. 2019).

In addition, we aim to increase patient reach of our four global health flagship programs in LMICs by at least 50% over the same period.

To reinforce our commitment to these targets, we issued a EUR 1.85 billion sustainability linked bond1 in 2020.

Bondholders are entitled to receive a higher amount of interest if Novartis does not meet its access targets.

In 2021, we achieved a 36% increase in patient reach with our strategic innovative therapies compared with the previous year (up 73% from 2019).

However, the latest figure was still more than double our 2019 baseline (please see the table on page 72 for more details).

We systematically assess our research and development portfolio against the unmet needs of underserved popula tions.

We select countries and sites to implement clinical trials based on medical needs, and we only initiate clinical trials in countries where we intend to make the medicine available to patients.

We also work with govern ments and nongovernmental organiza tions to increase clinical trial capabili ties in LMICs, with the goal of bringing more innovation to patients.

For more information on our research and development activities for malaria, sickle cell disease and other neglected diseases, please see the section Deliver transformative innovation.

Adaptive development Beyond our investigational therapies, we also adapt existing medicines for different patient groups or for diverse environments.

In 2021, for example, our Sandoz teams worked on a pediat ric friendly formulation of hydroxyurea to treat SCD that received conditional approval in Ghana less than six months after submission.

Our adaptive development work supports our global health flagship programs, as well as a range of other therapeutic areas.

For more informa tion, please see the Selected adaptive development projects table in the appendix of this report.

Our work on global health is aligned with our overall efforts to expand access to our medicines.

Sickle cell disease (ScD) is a genetic blood disorder that affects more than 6 million people worldwide.

While around 80% of the global disease burden is in Africa, SCD also affects approximately 100 000 children and adults in the US.

Novartis is exploring new therapeutics and working to improve care for SCD patients in both developed and developing countries.

Novartis has been at the forefront of the fight against malaria for more than two decades, launching the first fixed dose artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) and working with partners to deliver more than 1 billion antimalarials, the majority without profit.

Multidrug therapy donated by Novartis has been a cornerstone of global elimination efforts, leading to the treatment of more than 7 million people since 2000. chagas disease affects approximately 6 million people, mainly in Latin America.

Starting as a parasitic disease, it can lead to chronic cardiac disorders in up to 30% of patients.

Novartis is active in drug discovery for new antipar asitic compounds and clinical research on Chagas cardio myopathy, as well as health system strengthening initiatives.

In addition, through the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD), we continue to research and develop a promising portfolio of drug candidates for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases that affect around 1.6 billion people worldwide, including dengue fever, diarrheal disease and visceral leishmaniasis.

Access principle 2: affordability We use a combination of approaches to help patients across the income pyramid access our medicines.

We seek to price our medicines based on the value they deliver to patients, healthcare systems and society.

We aim to implement tiered pricing for launches in our Pharmaceuticals and Oncology business units, taking into account income levels, local affordabil ity barriers and economic realities, while maintaining the sustainability of our business.

We also make our medicines available through patient support programs, as well as managed access and post trial access programs.

The treatment adherence and treatment overlap factors are based on assumptions from developed markets.

Value based pricing We aim to price our medicines according to the value they deliver to patients, healthcare systems and society.

We believe this approach incentivizes healthcare systems to focus on interventions that deliver the most effective, efficient and sustaina ble outcomes.

In 2021, for example, we announced a world first agreement with the UK’s public healthcare system to make Leqvio, our cholesterol lowering medicine, available to patients in England through an innovative popula tion health management approach.

The agreement followed a positive recommendation by the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excel lence, which determines whether medicines represent value for money to the country’s healthcare system.

Novartis was also one of the first pharmaceutical companies to enter into value based contracting for medicines, linking pricing and reim bursement rates to specific outcomes including for Zolgensma, our break through gene therapy for patients with spinal muscular atrophy.

A variety of approaches exist on how to measure the value of our medi cines.

We aim to generate transpar ent, real world evidence to support the most accurate possible value assessment for our medicines.

While we take all of these factors into account in proposing the price of our medicines, in the majority of cases the final price is the result of a negotiation with payers.

We stand ready to support and strengthen healthcare systems in the journey toward value based healthcare, so the price of medicines overall can more closely and consist ently align with our principles without limiting patient access to care.

Equitable commercial models In 2014, Novartis introduced an emerging market brand (EMB) strat egy to expand access to innovative medicines to people in LMICs, in a way that is sustainable for our busi ness and supports governments in responding to unmet medical needs.

In 2021, we launched 26 EMBs in our Novartis Pharmaceuticals portfolio and five in Oncology.

These launches helped Novartis reach 483 459 patients through EMBs, a 31% increase from 2020.

Entresto, our heart failure medicine, is a key contributor to our target to increase patient reach for our strate gic innovative therapies.

EMBs for Entresto, which number 42 overall, achieved a 39% increase in patient reach and 43% growth in sales compared with 2020.

We continue to narrow or eliminate the time lag between launches in Europe and in LMICs. For instance, we launched the EMB of our lung cancer treatment Tabrecta in India in November, at least six months ahead of expected first launch in Europe.

Novartis Access is our portfolio of medicines to address public health needs in particular noncommunica ble diseases in lower income countries.

The program offers 15 on and off patent medicines, which in 2021 were provided to governments and public sector customers in 11 countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Since 2015, Novartis Access medicines have reached more than 5.4 million patients.

We also use social business models to reach patients in countries where Novartis has limited or no presence.

In 2021, through a program called Global Health Markets, we reached patients in Cuba, Cambodia and Laos.

Our community solutions, known as Healthy Family programs, provide health education and strengthen healthcare infrastructure for popula tions living at the base of the income pyramid in India, Kenya, Uganda and Vietnam.

In 2021, we expanded our geographical coverage in India and Vietnam, and we aim to launch the program in additional underserved markets.

Since 2007, Healthy Family programs have delivered health education to more than 75 million people.

To drive access in sub Saharan Africa (SSA), we established a dedicated Novartis SSA unit of about 700 employees that aims to expand the availability of our full portfolio of medicines, taking a high volume, lower price approach with an aspiration to double patient reach in the region by 2022.

For example, we aim to bring afforda ble cancer treatments to 22 countries in SSA through our Cancer Access Partnership (CAP) with the Clinton Health Access Initiative.

In 2021, we implemented the program in more than six countries, reaching patients with breast, prostate and cervical cancer through our CAP product line, which includes patented medicines and Sandoz generics.

Medicines are offered at a competitive yet sustaina ble price, and we are working with partners to minimize markups on CAP products for patients purchasing their treatments out of pocket.

Together with our partners, we aim to optimize the continuum of care across the patient journey, including through health system strengthening activities.

Zero profit models In 2021, we reached the milestone of 1 billion treatments of our antimalarial medicine Coartem delivered since 1999, with more than 90% supplied without profit.

For more information, please see One billion antimalarials delivered to patients on page 76.

Donations Through our donation programs, Novartis supports LMICs in their efforts to treat patients for neglected diseases or life threatening conditions, and to provide medicines in areas impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic, natural disasters and extreme poverty.

One of our key programs is CMLPath to Care , which connects people living with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with effective treatments made available at no cost, professional medical capabilities, trained physicians and hands on support.

The initiative is implemented in 67 countries that are most urgently in need of medicines, as identified by the Access to Medicine Index.

In 2021, the program reached more than 29 300 patients.

Our cholesterol lowering medicine Leqvio is a prime example of how we integrate innovative access strategies into the launch of our medicines.

Leqvio is approved in more than 50 countries to treat atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which accounts for over 85% of all cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths.

As part of our access strategy, we aim to introduce emerging market brands for Leqvio with tiered pricing in LMICs and upper middle income countries to address affordability challenges, based on local feasibility assessments.

We also intend to minimize time lags between first launch in Europe and launches in LMICs.

We also partner with health systems to improve patient outcomes.

In the UK, for instance, Leqvio is provided under a first of its kind population health management approach through the National Health Service in England it is expected to treat up to 300 000 patients at high risk of a second cardiovascular event in the community setting over three years.

We are also exploring population health approaches in other markets.

In Colombia, for example, we formed an alliance with the innovation chamber of the government and civil society stakeholders to help remove treatment barriers for more than 50 000 high risk CVD patients.

It is also included in data reported in the Novartis Global Health table.

For over 30 years, Novartis has been working with partners around the world to eliminate leprosy.

Since 2000, Novartis has donated more than 68 million blister packs of multidrug therapy (MDT) valued at approximately USD 119 million through the WHO, helping to treat more than 7.3 million leprosy patients worldwide.

In 2021, we extended our donation agreement with the WHO, and reached more than 75 000 patients.

This was lower that the number of patients reached in 2020, primarily due to countries reducing their screening activities amid the COVID 19 pandemic.

The new five year agreement with the WHO also covers the continuing donation of triclabendazole for the treatment of fascioliasis, a disease caused by parasites known as liver fluke.

Novartis has been donating the drug to the WHO since 2005, helping to treat around 2 million fascioliasis patients in more than 30 countries.

Operation Smile and Direct Relief to donate medicines to people affected by poverty and disaster.

In 2021, Sandoz donated products worth approximately USD 900 000 to these organizations.

Sandoz also collaborates with World Child Cancer, a charity that aims to improve diagnosis and access to treatment for children with cancer in LMICs.

In the first half of 2021, the partnership reached 128 children with cancer and trained 506 healthcare professionals in the Philippines.

Patient support programs Our patient support programs help patients access medicines they could not afford due to financial hardship, lack of insurance, or inadequate reimbursement.

They also help patients better manage their medica tion and disease outcomes through services including education, nurse programs and call centers.

Another program is Novartis Oncology Access, which shares the cost of medicines with government healthcare systems, charities and other payers, or directly with patients without health care coverage who are unable to pay the full cost.

In 2021, more than 29 400 patients in seven countries benefited from the Novartis Oncology portfolio in multiple disease areas.

Other examples include the Vale Mais Sa de program in Brazil, which reached more than 1.7 million patients in 2021.

The program provides discounts on Novartis therapies for chronic conditions and promotes disease awareness and treatment adherence.

In China, meanwhile, we reached 31 000 Cosentyx patients through a program designed to support patients and healthcare professionals with medication adher ence and disease awareness.

Overall, our patient support programs helped more than 3.8 million patients in 2021.

Managed access programs Physicians sometimes seek access to medicines that are not yet approved or available in their country to treat patients with serious or life threaten ing conditions.

Novartis Managed Access Programs (MAPs) address this need by making certain investiga tional or unapproved treatments available to eligible patients.

In 2021, we reviewed 8 559 MAP requests from physicians.

We approved 95% of those requests from 95 countries and across 62 com pounds.

At the end of 2021, more than 13 000 patients were receiving treatment through MAPs.

We fulfilled our 2021 commitment to make Zolgensma, our one time gene therapy to treat pediatric patients with spinal muscular atrophy, available to up to 100 patients via a global MAP. Further, Tabrecta was provided to 838 patients suffering from lung cancer.

Since 2017, Novartis has collaborated with an external Independent Bioethics Advisory Committee (IBAC), which provides analysis and recommendations on Novartis guidelines and policies for the ethical conduct of clinical research, and on selected ethical challenges that may arise in clinical trials, development programs, managed access programs and other areas across Novartis.

The IBAC is made up of bioethicists, clinicians, healthcare practitioners, patient advocates and other experts appropriate to the problem at hand.

Post trial access programs Novartis has a comprehensive post trial access (PTA) policy to ensure continuity of treatment for patients who have participated in a confirma tory, Novartis sponsored clinical trial designed to demonstrate superiority versus a placebo or another drug.

Patients who have derived clinical benefit from an investigational treat ment can continue to receive it, free of charge, until it is commercially avail able and accessible locally.

Our PTA commitment applies regard less of the severity of the disease, the availability of alternative therapies, or the geographical location of the clinical trial.

PTA commitments were incorporated in all in scope trials approved in 2021.

We also convene a cross functional consultation board to provide guid ance on PTA activities and ensure a consistent approach across the company in accordance with our Commitment to Patients and Caregiv ers and the Novartis Position on Post Trial Access.

For decades, Novartis has been involved in the fight against malaria, a disease that causes hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide despite it being treatable and curable.

In 1999, Novartis launched the first fixed dose artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT). In 2001, in a landmark agreement with the WHO, we were the first healthcare company to commit to supply antimalarial treatments to the public sector of endemic countries without profit.

In 2021, we reached the milestone of 1 billion treatments of our ACT delivered since 1999, with more than 90% supplied without profit.

More than 450 million were a pediatric formulation developed jointly with Medicines for Malaria Venture.

The WHO estimates that adopting ACTs as a first line treatment for malaria, together with prevention efforts and better diagnostics, have saved 7.6 million lives since 2000.

Moreover, increased temperatures and humidity due to climate change threaten to increase the number of insects that carry vector borne diseases like malaria.

We remain committed to finding solutions for patients: Alongside our access programs, Novartis is advancing the next generation of antimalarials, with several promising candidates in our development pipeline.

A medicine is only as good as the system that delivers it.

Improving access to healthcare requires long term investments in healthcare infra structure.

We work with governments and partners to strengthen healthcare systems and lower barriers to health care delivery.

For more information on our health system strengthening framework, please see the Novartis corporate website.

Tackling SCD in Africa Launched in Ghana in 2019, our Africa sickle cell disease (SCD) program is a public private partnership that encompasses newborn screening, diagnosis, treatment, education, research and advocacy.

In 2021, the program was active in Ghana and Uganda.

Novartis continues to work with our partners, including the ministries of health in both countries, to strengthen healthcare systems for the safe and sustainable delivery of SCD treatments for patients.

In 2022, we aim to launch the program in Tanzania and Kenya, where the government recently launched national guidelines for the manage ment of SCD.

As part of our efforts to support treatment for SCD in Africa, we received conditional approval for our SCD treatment crizanlizumab in Ghana in December 2021, only six months after submission.

Also in 2021, we received approval in Ghana for a pediatric friendly formulation of hydroxyurea to treat SCD (see Adaptive development ).

Addressing malaria and SCD in India India has the world’s highest burden of malaria and SCD outside of Africa.

Novartis is running a malaria screen ing campaign under the umbrella of the Novartis Healthy Family program (Arogya Parivar) in seven districts in Odisha state, a highly endemic area that bears almost a quarter of the country’s malaria burden.

Since the start of the campaign in September 2020, more than 121 000 people have been screened for malaria and potential co morbidities at around 2 200 health camps.

Separately, Novartis and local authorities in India established the National SCD council, which aims to address policy related gaps in delivering healthcare services to SCD patients.

This resulted in dedicated or increased funding for SCD diagnosis and treatment across 11 states in the country.

We also collaborated with partners to conduct education and awareness programs on SCD in the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, cover ing a total of 80 districts, 250 health care professionals and 1 150 health care workers.

Eliminating avoidable blindness One billion people worldwide live with preventable visual impairment due to a lack of access to basic eye care.

In 2021, we implemented a program built upon an ecosystem of key partners, including Aravind Eye Care System, a network of hospitals in India that is one of the largest providers of eye care in the world, to tackle avoidable blindness in under served communities in India.

In addition, our eXcellence in Ophthal mology Vision Awards (XOVA) have funded 44 projects across 27 LMICs to elevate community health educa tion activities, capability building and training for healthcare professionals, and access to affordable eye care services.

Moving forward, together with Aravind, XOVA and other global and local partners, we plan to expand the program to improve outcomes in underserved communities in SSA, Vietnam, the US and Bolivia.

The Novartis Foundation The Novartis Foundation focuses on advancing digital and data led approaches to population health, with a particular emphasis on cardiovascu lar disease (CVD), the leading cause of death globally.

Better Hearts Better Cities Rapid urbanization in LMICs, and associated lifestyle changes, present increasing challenges to address CVD and its prime risk factor, hypertension (high blood pressure).

Although therapeutic options exist, blood pressure control rates remain poor.

In November, the Novartis Foundation published its strategy for addressing cardiovascular population health, known as the CARDIO approach, in the journal Cities Health.

This approach has been applied across different continents together with local city authorities and partners in the Better Hearts Better Cities initiative, which addresses hyperten sion and its underlying determinants by increasing early access to quality care, promoting partnerships, and maximizing the application of technol ogy to strengthen health systems.

First results show that between 2018 and 2019, blood pressure control rates in patients treated with medica tion improved in S o Paulo (Brazil), Dakar (Senegal) and Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia).

Reducing inequity in cardiovascular health Our health is influenced by where we are born, grow, live, work and age these factors are referred to as social determinants of health (SDoH). During the COVID 19 pandemic, SDoH put a spotlight on health inequities world wide, yet the differences in health outcomes between population groups reach far beyond the pandemic, especially when it comes to cardio vascular (CV) population health.

Together with local partners, Novartis is helping to train vendors like Mr. Oyibe to test for common childhood illnesses such as malaria.

Severe cases are referred to the closest health center.

Expanding access through generics and biosimilars Our Sandoz Division, a leading global generics company, plays an important role in Novartis efforts to increase access to affordable, high quality medicines for patients worldwide.

In 2021, Sandoz reached approximately 490 million patients with its portfolio of around 1 000 molecules across a wide range of disease areas.

Generics and biosimilars enable healthcare systems to improve access while containing spending growth.

In the US, for example, generics accounted for 90% of the volume but only 18% of the cost of prescription medicines in 2020, according to research firm IQVIA.

Sandoz teams consider access in pricing strategies for all medicines, for example by typically entering the market well below the list price of the reference product, as well as taking local economic realities into account and acting to keep prices stable at times of market disruption such as during the COVID 19 pandemic.

Our portfolio of generics and biosimi lars increases the supply of affordable medicines across the income pyramid.

They also provide the majority of products to our global health markets.

As one of the world’s largest suppliers of antibiotics, Sandoz also plays a central role in our efforts to tackle antimicrobial resistance.

For more information, please see the section Advancing our program to combat antimicrobial resistance.

Leveraging the foundation’s CARDIO approach and Microsoft’s data storage and data analytics tools, partners will work with city health authorities to better understand the factors that drive unequal CV health outcomes.

Ultimately, the aim is to create roadmaps that translate these insights into action and prioritize the most impactful interventions.

For more information on the Novartis Foundation, please see www.novartisfoundation.org.

The Novartis US Foundation The Novartis US Foundation seeks to improve health in underserved com munities in the US by creating innova tive and sustainable solutions to expand access to healthcare and build trust within the healthcare system.

In the US, health disparities affecting minority groups are endemic an issue that was highlighted and exacer bated by the COVID 19 pandemic.

In 2021, Novartis and the Novartis US Foundation announced plans to invest approximately USD 13.7 million to establish three research centers at Morehouse School of Medicine in Georgia, including a clinical trial center of excellence that could be a model for possible expansion to other historically Black colleges, universities and medical schools.

Please see the section Deliver transformative innovation for more details on how we work to address diversity in clinical trials.

Acting in an ethical manner is essen tial to building trust with society.

Our stakeholders not only expect us to do what is legally required, but also to fol low high standards of ethical behavior wherever we operate.

Supporting ethical decision making We are making progress in embed ding our Code of Ethics across the organization and supporting employ ees to do what’s right when faced with ethical dilemmas.

In 2021, around 98% of employees completed e training on the Code of Ethics.

In addition, around 84 000 employees visited an internal Code of Ethics information platform and around 65 000 accessed an online tool called Decision Explorer that provides guidance to help resolve ethical dilemmas.

We also launched a toolkit to support leaders in discuss ing ethical dilemmas with their teams.

We improved the way we manage conflicts of interest with the release of a revised framework, including a new guideline, disclosure process and supporting tool.

Around 97% of employees completed a declaration on potential conflicts of interest.

Further, we took steps to integrate an ethics dialogue into the process for recruiting potential new employees.

In 2021, we launched a guide for inter viewers to assess the ethical profile of potential hires and their fit with the Novartis Values and Behaviors and our Code of Ethics.

By signaling that ethics and integrity matter to Novartis during the first interaction with a candidate, we improve our chances of hiring high integrity individuals who are a good fit for our ethical culture.

In our Code of Ethics, we commit to use artificial intelligence in a transpar ent and responsible way.

In 2021, we were one of the first companies to issue a position statement on the topic.

For more information, please see the section Go big on data and digital.

Advances in digital technology have led to new, more personalized ways of engaging with our customers across multiple channels.

To ensure we navigate these changes in the external environment ethically, we are adjusting our Professional Practices Policy and processes to create consistency in how we manage new relevant types of compliance risks.

We have rolled out a global system architecture to ensure our processes are implemented consistently across markets.

Measuring our ethical climate We launched our first annual global ethics survey in 2021 to measure our progress in embedding our Code of Ethics across the organization.

Translated into 15 languages, the survey was sent out to 150 000 Novartis employees and external contractors.

The results from more than 50 000 responses to the survey provide us with robust data across different parts of the company to evaluate the effectiveness of our policies, pro grams and controls.

Importantly, they also help us identify areas where we may need to reinforce our ethical culture and climate.

We are working to turn these insights into processes and tools to further encourage ethical behavior, and we plan to repeat the survey in 2022 to gain further insights.

Novartis participated in a collective action initiated by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) to jointly develop a reporting standard on anti bribery.

In early 2022, we published our first anti bribery report based on the guidance issued by NBIM and aligned with principles such as the United Nations (UN) Global Compact and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

We continue to make progress in expanding our efforts to respect human rights within our operations and throughout our supply chain.

In 2021, we published a holistic Human Rights Commitment Statement that builds on our previous commitments and reflects the increasing impor tance of integrating human rights across the organization.

New measurement framework In 2021, we took another key step in implementing the UN Guiding Princi ples on Business and Human Rights by developing a measurement frame work to track our performance across three pillars: due diligence, empower ment and external engagement.

We continued our engagement in five priority areas: third party labor rights, diversity and inclusion, clinical trials, grievance mechanisms, and anti brib ery and corruption.

We also updated our list of 12 salient human rights issues based on human rights assess ments conducted since 2017.

Anti bribery policies and practices Our Anti Bribery Policy states expec tations for all employees, and we also clearly state our standards in our Code of Ethics.

Specific principles are set out in our Professional Practices Policy, while third party risk is gov erned by our Anti Bribery Third Party Guideline.

Our SpeakUp Office investigates allegations of misconduct.

Human rights assessment of clinical trials Clinical trials play a critical role in medicine development, but they also raise significant human rights consid erations.

In 2021, we completed a human rights assessment of the global policy framework governing our clinical trials.

Results showed that we are aligned with external expectations on human rights, including on informed consent, transparency, post trial access to medicine, financial compen sation, and potential conflicts of interest, among other areas.

Please see here for a list of relevant policies and here for clinical trial results.

Empowering employees to under stand and assess human rights Through our internal Human Rights Ambassador Network, we worked with our pharmaceutical export business to develop a human rights assessment toolkit.

We are piloting two remote human rights assess ments in countries with heightened human rights risk.

Purchasing raw materials from certified sources Internally, we continued to address risks from raw material inputs into our medicines, and we are rolling out guides to support our procurement team in purchasing ingredients from certified sources.

Externally, through the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative’s Human Rights and Labor Subcommittee, which Novartis co chairs, we continued to investigate human rights risks associated with raw material inputs in pharmaceutical products and to develop approaches for collective action in our supply chains.

Integrating human rights into our third party risk process In 2021, we completed the integration of human rights into the four relevant risk areas (labor rights health, safety and environment data privacy and anti bribery and corruption) in our Third Party Risk Management process.

This included updating our Third Party Code and self assessment questionnaires, as well as ongoing training with our third party labor rights risk experts.

Further, we launched a pilot to sup port suppliers with higher risk profiles in implementing our Third Party Code.

Training rolled out from July 2021 to January 2022, with a preliminary completion rate as of December 31, 2021.

As a result, we may restate the previous two years of reported data.

Singapore and Malaysia to develop guidance and key performance indicators to help them manage risks linked to migrant workers.

We publish a statement explaining how we address modern slavery risks or impacts each year.

The Novartis SpeakUp Office, which from 2021 has been integrated into the Ethics, Risk Compliance (ERC) function, enables employees and external parties to raise concerns about potential misconduct while being protected against retaliation.

In 2021, a total of 2 099 complaints of alleged misconduct resulting in 1 932 cases, with 2 385 allegations, were received and handled.

Of the com plaints, 84% came via the SpeakUp channel and the remainder were self identified via existing internal con trols.

We saw a 5% increase in SpeakUp complaints in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to employees returning to work sites as the pandemic situation eased in some countries, and due to increased training and awareness of the program.

Of the total cases, 174 (9%) were classified as central matters (higher risk cases) warranting further investi gation, while 1 758 lower risk matters were addressed or investigated locally.

The investigated central matter allegations resulted in 62 dismissals or resignations, and in 27 written warnings.

Other remedial actions such as training, coaching and implementing new controls were also used when deemed appropriate.

The shift to new ways of working amid the COVID 19 pandemic led to certain SpeakUp topics arising more fre quently.

For instance, we observed an increase in complaints regarding leadership behaviors amid flexible working arrangements, as well as those related to company guidelines on vaccinations or testing.

Such complaints typically did not require investigation and could be addressed through local management or human resources teams.

Allegations related to improper professional practices continued to decrease in 2021 due to the strengthening of our ERC policy, training and monitoring program.

In 2021, we took steps to increase awareness about the SpeakUp pro gram in certain markets and regions through targeted training and aware ness sessions.

We saw, for instance, a 6% increase in misconduct reporting in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.

Transparent reporting and disclosure play a key role in building trust with society.

Novartis applies and supports laws and regulations that promote transparency around relationships between healthcare companies and healthcare professionals, healthcare organizations and patient organiza tions, and related transfers of value.

Novartis is keeping pace with these developments and is committed to meeting new transparency require ments.

For patient organizations, Novartis goes beyond the reporting require ments set by the EFPIA (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Indus tries and Associations) Code of Practice.

We publish a global report covering transfers of value made to patient organizations in all countries where we operate.

Novartis has supported transparency in clinical trials for more than 20 years and was one of the first companies to commit to publishing trial results of innovative medicines within one year of study completion, regardless of outcome.

For more information, please see www.novartisclinicaltrials.com.

Our purpose as a global medicines company is inherently social, and we have a responsibility, together with governments and civil society, to contribute solutions to big societal problems such as climate change and antimicrobial resistance.

We can help drive positive change by harnessing the assets that make us successful in the first place: people, ideas and capital.

For information on how we help combat the global problem of falsified medi cines, please see the section Embrace operational excellence.

Our commitment to environmental sustainability is an important part of how we build trust with society and is aligned with our purpose.

Unless we can operate sustainably, our efforts to improve and extend people’s lives may be compromised by our environmen tal impact.

In 2021, we further strengthened our environmental targets by committing to become net zero in terms of climate emissions across our value chain by 2040, building on our mid and long term goals to become carbon neutral, plastic neutral and water sustainable.

More details on our performance in 2021 can be found in our climate related financial disclo sures (TCFD).

Please see our corpo rate website for full details of our environmental sustainability strategy.

Environmental targets Our targets to be carbon neutral, plas tic neutral and water sustainable are the central focus of our environmental sustainability strategy.

In 2021, we reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 34% (Scope 1 and Scope 2) versus our 2016 baseline, making further progress after a 26% reduction in the previous year.

Suppliers being trained on Novartis water quality standards disposal by 56%, compared with 38% in 2020 (all versus 2016 baseline figures).

In addition, we achieved our goal of eliminating 17 types of single use plastics at 132 Novartis workplaces in scope (remaining stocks are being used at some locations).

For example, in the US, all single use plastic bottles in vending machines were replaced by recyclable aluminum, glass or biode gradable containers.

To reach our emissions targets, we are reducing our energy demand and accelerating our procurement of renewable electricity.

We aim to use 100% renewable electricity in our own operations by 2025.

In 2020, our own operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) represented 9% of our overall carbon footprint (Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3).

To achieve net zero carbon emissions across our value chain will therefore require a coordinated approach with our suppliers.

In 2021, we launched Novartis Green Expectations from Suppliers, which requires suppliers to map out their emissions, water consumption and waste footprint baselines understand water quality thoroughly set targets and report their progress.

For more on how we approach environmental sustainability in our manufacturing operations and our supply chain, please see the section Embrace operational excellence.

In 2021, Novartis laboratories were certified by My Green Lab, a third party framework that aims to improve environmental sustainability in labora tory settings.

More than 800 Novartis researchers across 24 laboratory sites in 11 countries took part in the certifica tion process.

Novartis sites use water for cleaning and cooling purposes, and as a solvent.

To ensure the effective management of water quality, we go beyond regulatory requirements and ensure that our active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are discharged at levels that are predicted to not cause harm to the environment.

By 2030, we will expand our current water quality scope to include all efflu ents from API and finished dosage form production within Novartis and relevant suppliers, and become water neutral.

This means ensuring the amount of water Novartis withdraws from the local environment does not contribute to the depletion of local water reserves.

It entails valuing the water needs of stakeholders and the ecosystem in an equitable way.

Further details of our progress in the area of water quality and quantity are included in the CDP Water Security Report, the AMR Industry Alliance report and the Access to Medicine Foundation AMR Benchmark report.

Sustainable medicines Novartis is committed to embedding environmental sustainability into the design of new products, devices and packaging.

We assess the environmen tal impact associated with all stages of a product’s life, from raw material extraction to processing, manufactur ing, distribution, use and disposal.

In 2020 and 2021, we conducted pilot life cycle assessment studies for one of our respiratory dry powder inhaler devices, which showed that on average our product has a low carbon footprint compared to other products with similar published studies.

Any significant deviations are restated the following year in the Novartis in Society Integrated Report.

The methodology changed in 2021, with previous years’ data covering emissions from air travel only.

This is part of a calculation effort to expand the Scope 3 category 6 emission activities reported and part of a wider Scope 3 calculation review that aims to increase the coverage to more than 90% of the overall Scope 3.

New to 2021, air travel emissions now also cover radiative forcing, which multiplies the indirect emissions by 1.9.

The published metric represents actual data from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, which was made available on January 5, 2022.

This data may be updated after the reporting date as emissions are calculated based on bookings, which may be adjusted after the reporting period.

For further Scope 3 disclosures, please see our latest HSE supplement.

The Santo Domingo forest carbon offset project in Argentina is due to reach maturity as projects near this phase, routine operations involve thinning and harvesting.

These operations have generated the negative GHG emissions offset value for 2021.

The Santo Domingo offsets are based on January June actual data and July December estimates, while offsets from our Hacienda El Manatial project in Colombia are based on January September actual data and October December estimates (to be revised with actuals in Q1 2022).

The methodology we use to measure offsets will be reviewed in 2022.

We take a balanced, cross secto rial approach to combating AMR.

Prevention Responsible manufacturing to help reduce the environmental impact of the production of antibiotics.

Manufacturing site in Austria is hub of last vertically integrated antibiotic production chain in Europe.

Access Strengthening high quality, affordable antibiotics portfolio.

Responsible use Balancing access efforts with global and local initiatives to ensure prescription of the right drug at the right dose for the right duration.

New tools and technological solutions for advocacy, surveillance, diagnostics and education.

Healthcare professional patient education, user friendly packs, awareness campaigns, safe drug disposal.

Innovation and adaptive development Focusing on areas where we can really make a difference.

To this end, in 2021 we established a Green Ambassadors Network to communi cate, sponsor and share sustainability initiatives between local and global teams.

We also established a global network of colleagues collaborating on sustainability projects, and we offered new training modules to all employees on our environmental sustainability strategy.

The WHO has declared antimicrobial resistance (AMR) when antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines become ineffective and infections become increasingly difficult or impossible to treat as one of the major public health threats facing humanity.

Novartis supports the global scientific consensus that overuse, underuse and misuse of antimicrobial medicines all contribute to the spread of AMR, and that a balanced approach encom passing prevention, stewardship, access and innovation is needed.

Responsible manufacturing is a central part of our efforts.

This includes minimizing antibiotic residues especially into water bodies and reducing waste.

Please see the section Enhancing environmental sustainability for more information.

We also continue to invest in new antibiotic manufacturing facilities.

In 2021, our Sandoz Division which is the world’s largest volume provider of generic antibiotics confirmed it would invest more than EUR 100 million in new manufacturing technol ogy at its Kundl site in Austria, the hub of the only remaining end to end antibiotic manufacturing network in Europe.

Sandoz also announced a EUR 50 million investment in new production technology and increased manufacturing capacity at its Palafolls site in Spain.

Education on responsible use is key to tackling AMR.

We embarked on a program with MedShr to train health care professionals on antimicrobial resistance, reaching 250 000 individ uals through 33 000 engagements.

AMR education is a key feature of our partnerships with Save the Children in Kenya and with the Commonwealth Pharmacists Association across SSA.

We also engage with communities directly in rural areas of Africa and India as part of our Healthy Family program, including on water rehabili tation projects in Kenya and India.

In addition, we contribute to multi stakeholder solutions to combat AMR.

For instance, through STELLA and Bio Campus, we are developing solutions for enhanced AMR surveil lance and recommendations for improved treatment guidelines to mitigate the risk of resistance.

As a member of the AMR Industry Alliance, we are working with peer companies to roll out voluntary standards for responsible manufacturing, and with the Responsible Antibiotics Manufac turing Platform (RAMP) on responsi ble antibiotic manufacturing.

We also extended our collaboration with Ares Genetics to further leverage molecu lar predictive antibiotic susceptibility testing to support physicians in selecting appropriate antibiotic therapies.

We support innovation and adaptive development in antibiotics.

For example, Novartis is an investor in the AMR Action Fund together with other pharmaceutical companies, philan thropic organizations and develop ment banks.

The initiative aims to bring two to four new antibiotics to patients by 2030.

Photo In 2007, Novartis purchased the Santo Domingo Estate in northern Corrientes, Argentina, for a carbon sink project.

Today, it is our most mature proj ect, helping to offset our carbon emissions through carbon removals via native species.

Responding to the call from UNICEF to combat childhood pneumonia, Sandoz developed pediatric amoxicil lin, today recommended by the WHO as first line treatment for childhood pneumonia.

Novartis was ranked fourth in the 2021 Antimicrobial Resistance Benchmark (from fifth in 2020), which evaluates the performance of the world’s 17 largest pharmaceutical companies in the fight against AMR. We are recognized for performing strongly in the areas of responsible manufacturing, appropriate access and stewardship.

Novartis is committed to using alter natives to animal research wherever feasible.

Our global policy and stand ards define key principles, responsibil ities and requirements governing animal research.

All studies spon sored by Novartis, whether conducted internally or externally, must adhere to our policy and standards.

In 2021, all Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research in vivo research sites received accreditation from the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International, underscoring our progress in conducting responsible animal research.

We adhere to the 3R principles: reduce the number of animals in studies, refine study methods to improve the animal’s experience, and replace animal studies with alternative options.

In 2021, for example, researchers across three disease areas joined forces to profile neuroin flammation pathways in a model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), reducing the number of animals needed for study by 86%.

Similarly, researchers reduced the number of animals needed for a chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) study by developing a non invasive method for measuring anti tumor activity in the same animals over time.

We also replaced the use of animals in a training program on key principles of surgery by deploying a new digital training platform.

For animals needed for both internally and externally conducted animal studies, please see here.

Strong corporate governance supports the effective management of our business and is the basis of trust in our company.

We have specific internal policies in place in areas such as data privacy, non discrimination, anti brib ery, human rights and HSE, which help us maintain high standards of ethics and integrity across our business.

Risk management The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process at Novartis is a series of coordinated activities designed to identify risks, promote accountability and support balanced decision mak ing.

Our objective is to prevent or minimize risks that may affect our business, while ensuring that we can still capture opportunities for growth.

Central to our approach is the Novartis Code of Ethics, which comprises 23 commitments on topics such as human rights, drug safety, data use, and access to medicines.

The code guides employees in daily decision making and provides an ethical framework to our risk manage ment approach.

For more information on how we embed our Code of Ethics across the organization, see page 80.

Many of our policies and controls are based on international norms and standards, including the United Nations Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enter prises, and standards published by the International Labor Organization.

We regard ethics, compliance and good risk management as crucial to maintaining public trust.

Regular workshops are held across the company to identify risks and possible mitigation measures.

These are consolidated into the Novartis Risk Compass, which provides an overview of strategic, operational and emerging risks for use by senior management (see page 22).

The Chief Ethics, Risk Compliance Officer is responsible for the overall risk management process at Novartis.

The ERC function oversees the company’s risk management and compliance functions, including risk based companywide policy and internal control management, as well as crisis and business continuity management.

The ECN, led by the CEO, reviews and endorses the risk portfolio.

The Board of Directors provides the highest layer of oversight.

It focuses on the most significant risks, while the Board level Risk Committee reviews the entire risk portfolio and actions implemented by management.

For further details on the Risk Committee and its activities, please see page 142 of our 2021 Annual Report.

In 2021, we integrated global gover nance of our HSE activities within ERC, merging it with our Business Continuity Management and Novartis Emergency Management teams to create a new function called Global HSE Resilience.

The goal is to reduce risks, increase resilience and generate further positive impact on our people, patients and planet.

Compliance As part of our ERC approach, we have a comprehensive compliance man agement system to detect and prevent systemic misconduct.

This system covers five principal risk areas: ethical dilemmas, bribery and corruption, third party misconduct, professional practices, and conflicts of interest.

Within our ERC function, we have a team responsible for monitoring compliance and taking action to address any misconduct with internal units and third parties.

In 2021, the Novartis SpeakUp Office, which enables employees and exter nal parties to raise concerns about potential misconduct while being protected against retaliation, was integrated into the ERC function to further align our efforts and embed our Code of Ethics across the organi zation (see page 82).

Internal Audit assists the Board of Directors and the ECN in discharging their governance responsibilities by providing independent assurance and advice on the effectiveness, efficiency and adequacy of processes and controls that support Novartis in achieving its objectives, managing its major risks, and ensuring compliance with applicable policies, laws and regulations.

In 2021, our Internal Audit function carried out a total of 46 audits, ten internal reviews and 14 advisories most conducted remotely due to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic.

These engagements covered the entire value chain of Novartis and key strategic and operational risks.

Internal Audit is part of Novartis Business Assurance Advisory (NBAA), an independent function that also comprises the Global Security function with its four pillars: falsified medicines, investigation, intelligence and executive protection.

NBAA plays an important role in supporting the risk and compliance process, and provides protection, insight and advice to the business and the ACC.

In 2021, we continued our transformation into a leading, focused medicines company powered by technology, leadership in research and development, world class commer cialization, global access and data science.

Feedback from shareholder engagement prior to our last Annual General Meeting (AGM) suggested that shareholders were in agreement that our current compensation system is aligned with the company’s purpose, strategy and culture.

The year completes the first three year performance cycle of the new Long Term Performance Plan (LTPP), follow ing the combination of the previous LTPP and the Long Term Relative Performance Plan (LTRPP), as commu nicated in our 2018 Compensation Report.

The combined plan focuses on four equally weighted performance metrics: net sales compound annual growth rate (CAGR), core operating income CAGR, innovation, and relative total shareholder return (TSR).

In 2021, we reviewed our Compensa tion Report format with a view to increase its accessibility while maintain ing its depth of disclosure.

We chose to develop our compensation at a glance section to incorporate a more graphical illustration of the 2021 CEO pay outcomes and a summary of our executive compensation framework for 2022.

In addition, we provide further visibility into the 2019 2021 LTPP targets, showing the threshold, target and maximum opportunity for each performance metric.

While overall sales performance was on target, COVID 19 continued to impact parts of our business, specifically Oncology and Sandoz.

We continued to deliver innovation to patients in 2021 with 21 approvals, including Leqvio (US, EU) and Scem blix (US), and 34 submissions made across our top four markets.

However, the year was not without setbacks, as some clinical trials of experimental compounds including Kymriah for blood cancer, ACZ885 (canakinumab) for lung cancer, and CFZ533 (iscalimab) in kidney transplant patients did not meet their primary goals.

We progressed our efforts to deliver next generation medicines while driving our environmental, social and governance (ESG) agenda.

Pursuing new health equity initiatives in clinical trial diversity, advancing access to medicines, and using data and digital technologies in underserved regions in Africa, South America and Asia are examples of our long term commit ment to transform global health.

More details on our ESG efforts are pro vided earlier in this report.

Performance against the incentive tar gets, combined with base salary and other benefits, pension, Alcon Keep Whole awards and dividend equiva lents, resulted in 2021 total realized compensation for the CEO of CHF 11 224 727.

Overall, while the financial and operational targets were met or surpassed, some of the innovation targets were missed, which led to a reduction in long term growth potential.

This is reflected in a TSR performance below the peer group median.

The reduced contribution of innovation and relative TSR to the 2019 2021 LTPP cycle were the main drivers of the lower total realized com pensation in 2021 versus 2020.

Full details of the 2019 2021 LTPP perfor mance can be found in the Compen sation Report of our 2021 Annual Report.

Our strategy is to build a focused medicines company powered by technology, leadership in research and development, world class commercial ization, global access and data science.

We foster a company culture that is inspired, curious and unbossed.

We believe these elements drive continued innovation and will support the creation of value over the long term for our company, society and shareholders.

To continue to align the compensation system with this strategy and to ensure that Novartis is a high performing organization, the company operates both a short term Annual Incentive plan and a Long Term Incentive (LTI) plan with a balanced set of measures and targets.

The Board of Directors determines specific, measurable and time bound performance measures for the Annual Incentive and LTI plans.

The Compensation Committee has reviewed the existing compensation system and determined that it contin ues to support our strategy.

The 2019 2021 cycle is the first vesting of the new LTPP plan, when the metrics were transformed into four equally weighted measures: net sales CAGR, core operating income CAGR, innovation and relative TSR.

A summary of the compensation decision authorization levels within the parameters set by the AGM is shown below, along with an overview of the risk management principles.

Novartis committed in 2020 to fully support the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclo sures (TCFD) and included a qualitative disclosure in the Novartis in Society Report that year.

This is our first quantitative TCFD disclosure, building on our qualitative disclosure and responses to the CDP climate questionnaire in previous years.

We aim to provide iterative qualitative and quantitative disclosures on climate related topics on a recurring basis as we incorporate the TCFD recommendations into our business, enterprise risk management and strategy development and become more mature in how we create actionable information on climate risks and opportunities.

Governance board oversight The Governance, Nomination and Corporate Responsibilities Committee of the Novartis Board of Directors receives regu lar updates on climate risks and opportunities as part of its oversight of environmental, social and governance (ESG) top ics.

These are scheduled as written updates semi annually, with verbal updates in alternating quarters.

Management oversight Under the leadership of the CEO, the Executive Committee of Novartis (ECN) is responsible for approving the environmen tal sustainability strategy of Novartis, including climate, water, and waste targets.

The Chief Sustainability Officer provides an annually updated climate scenario analysis, and information on physical and transition risks and opportunities to the ECN.

The Trust Reputation Committee, chaired by the CEO, meets every two months to assess progress as part of a quarterly ESG scorecard submission process.

It also updates the ECN and the Board on progress and challenges.

Novartis launched a new environmental sustainability strategy in 2021.

Per the revised governance, under the leadership of the Chief Sustainability Officer, the Environmental Sustainability Office will provide the leadership, subject matter exper tise and portfolio management support that will support the implementation of our strategy.

The primary steering commit tee for this strategy is the Environmental Sustainability Strategy Implementation Steering Committee (ESSI), while the Trust Reputation Committee will continue to oversee its delivery.

Refer to CDP question C1.1b. b) Describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate related risks and opportunities.

Climate change will have a major impact on our business, including our operations, strategy, financial planning and value chain, as well as on stakeholders such as patients.

For example, climate change is already causing extreme heat and poor air quality in some areas, which threatens to exacerbate pre existing health conditions such as heart failure, lung cancer and respiratory diseases.

In addition, an increase in temperature and humidity may cause a proliferation of insects that carry vec tor borne diseases, including dengue fever, malaria, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis.

Novartis is working to understand and anticipate these risks to ensure we can continue to discover, develop and deliver life saving medicines.

Novartis has been active in integrating climate and environmental considerations into our financial planning.

For example, we apply a threshold of USD 20 million for capital expenditure projects requiring an environmental sustainability review.

We also operate with a USD 100 per ton shadow carbon price to help inform our strategic decision making and budget plan ning with respect to carbon impacts.

In 2020 and 2021, climate change met the financial materiality threshold for inclusion in our core Annual Report and in our ERM process as part of a broader strategic risk focused on ESG topics.

Processes Novartis conducted a long term sensitivity and stress testing analysis for climate and water in collaboration with the Mas sachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change as the first generation climate risk analysis.

The analysis was based on a scenario that aligns to the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 6.0 model for temperature change, which assumes that climate policy remains constant in the wake of the Paris Accord after 2030, and that significant technology advancements in low carbon emissions technologies take time to scale.

The scenario analysis was a multiphase project which included a detailed climate risk analysis of a key site, as well as an initial global assessment of 70 sites that are critical for the production and research parts of the company.

The scenarios used 2030, 2050 and 2070 as timelines.

During 2021, Novartis initiated a second round of climate scenario analysis to define physical and transition risks across its operations and supply chain.

The physical risk analysis was based on a comparison of outcomes aligned to RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 over two timeframes (2030 and 2050).

Physical risk was assessed at 21 sites to include business critical opera tions sites, major research and development locations, and other major support sites.

The transition risk analysis related to the transition to a low carbon economy was based on a 1.5 degree outcome and a 3.0 degree outcome, and was run over four timeframes (2025, 2030, 2040 and 2050).

Initial risks and opportunities were assessed at the enterprise level.

The ongoing climate scenario analysis is being coordinated with Novartis employees in production, procurement, facilities, finance, risk and business continuity, with the aim of supporting the existing ERM process as well as business decisions in areas such as utilities procurement, physical adaptation, and potential future changes in therapeutic research and devel opment.

In 2020 and into 2021, we conducted a further analysis with MIT of water scarcity risks in three critical water basins in China, Europe and South Africa.

The analysis is being used to plan for investments in water stewardship and to achieve our water neutrality target.

Progress The following Novartis accomplishments in 2021 are relevant to the TCFD recommendations: Novartis conducted environmental life cycle analysis (LCA) pilot studies for its respiratory dry powder inhaler (DPI) devices across six environmental categories in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol’s sector guidance for pharmaceuticals and medical devices.

The study suggested that the Novartis DPIs have, on average, a carbon footprint of less than half compared to other published DPI LCAs with classical pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) using HFC 134a as propellant gas displaying an average carbon footprint of up to 50 times higher than the Novartis DPI.

Including carbon impact and pricing into early stage development of drugs can drive investment optimization and reduce carbon emissions during the scale up of new products.

Following the success of DPI devices, we launched a new sustainability study on Coartem to make it our next and our first large scale carbon neutral project.

We reached the milestone of 1 billion treatments of our artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) delivered since.

More than 450 million were a pediatric formulation developed jointly with Medicines for Malaria Venture.

The World Health Organization estimates that adopting ACTs as a first line treatment for malaria, together with prevention efforts and better diagnostics, have saved 7.6 million lives since 2000.

Construction started for new generation capacity as part of our pan European virtual power purchase agreement.

It will deliver 100% renewable electricity and carbon neutrality for procured electricity in Novartis European operations by 2022 through newly built solar and wind projects in Spain.

Novartis partnered with One Young World to organize and sponsor Operation Planetary Health to raise awareness about environmental sustainability and to create a movement to accelerate change within the organization.

The theme of planetary health aligned with and built on Novartis environmental sustainability targets and strategy.

The event aimed to inspire employees to address specific environmental challenges with actionable and sustainable solutions.

Our focus was on carbon neutrality (Scope 3 emissions emissions in our value supply chain) and the circular economy.

We also sought to gain insights and solutions for emerging issues that do not yet form part of our company targets.

We developed the Novartis Green Expectations from Suppliers document to outline what is needed from our suppliers and support them on that journey.

Using the ACCA model, we track and measure suppliers’ journey toward carbon neutrality.

Comprehension of the requirements of the carbon emission targets 3.

The Green Expectations framework was issued to 43 suppliers in 2021.

Green Expectations initiative, with 88% of participating suppliers acknowledging receipt.

We are engaging our suppliers in dialogue, and this will be underpinned with concrete tools and mechanisms to facilitate their journey as much as possible.

The breadth of this engagement approximately 36 000 suppliers means the process needs time to yield significant results, particularly among suppliers with whom we do not have direct interaction.

In 2021, Novartis joined the 100 plus company EV100 initiative, demonstrating our commitment to transition our fleet to electric vehicles (EVs).

Novartis plans to reduce vehicle fleet emissions by over 63% by 2025, and 94% by 2030.

In 2021, implementation began in 30 countries, impacting 18,000 of 26,000 vehicles in the Novartis fleet.

We also joined RE100 in 2021, a global initiative bringing together the world’s most influential businesses committed to.

Our power purchase agreements with renewable power developers, both existing and in the commissioning phase, are a key vehicle to us achieving our target 100% renewable energy in the US, Canadian and European markets by 2023.

We made further progress in reducing our emissions: Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased by 34% in 2021 versus the.

In 2021, business travel was 85% less when compared to 2019.

While this was largely due to COVID 19 restrictions, internal processes have been adapted to maximize virtual meeting technology and dramatically reduce future travel even as pandemic restrictions are relaxed in the future.

Scope 3 data accuracy has been enhanced in terms of extent and method of calculation.

A more robust tracking system is in place to enable comparability of calculations and data across years.

Currently, we can account for over 90% of our Scope 3 emissions.

New manufacturing technologies have been implemented and utility equipment has been upgraded to improve process efficiencies.

These updates include continuous manufacturing, biocatalysts and high intensity perfusion batches.

In 2021, Novartis identified 59 locations as being situated in regions that are either currently water stressed or will be classified as such in the coming years.

Seven of these locations are currently deemed high risk.

We will work with these locations to minimize their water consumption, and we aim to achieve neutrality by ensuring that an equivalent of water that cannot be avoided is returned to the same watershed.

In 2021, Novartis supported the development of a watershed project in the Telangana, India, region that will address the long term challenge of water availability in water stressed areas.

The goal is to help local communities in the long run by increasing water availability, providing additional and safe drinking water, supporting agricultural best practice, building personal hygiene structures for schoolchildren, and contributing to the local ecosystems.

This will serve as a pilot to also examine how Novartis can most successfully contribute to water security in water stressed regions of the world where we may have water intense production operations.

Novartis disclosures a) Describe the climate related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium and long term.

Refer to CDP questions C2.1a, C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4 and C2.4a. b) Describe the impact of climate related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning.

Refer to CDP questions C2.1b, C2.2, C2.3a, C2.4a, C3.1. c) Describe the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate related scenarios, including a 2 C or lower scenario.

Novartis integrates risk and strategy issues in a cross functional ERM process.

All risks are consolidated in a framework called the Novartis Risk Compass, which enables senior management, the ECN and the Novartis Board of Directors to focus on key risks and to align the company strategy to our risk exposure.

For more information on how we identify, assess and manage our risks, please see pages 22 25.

Novartis is potentially exposed to physical risks from varying extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, or any other event that may result from the impact of climate change on the environment.

For example, some of our pro duction facilities are located in places that, because of increasingly violent weather events, sea level rise, or both, are at a progressively higher risk of substantial flooding.

Other facilities that depend on the availability of water for manufacturing processes may be impacted by water scarcity.

During 2021, Novartis initiated a second round of climate scenario analysis to define physical and transition risks across its operations and supply chain.

All of the detailed calculations were provided by an expert third party, Environmental Resources Management, using initial data collection.

Knowing that this is an iterative process and that both data granularity and under standing of company specific risks will increase over time, Environmental Resources Management and Novartis have esti mated risk exposure and management costs associated with these limited initial risks as: risk a Novartis operates globally, and we have significant financial exposure to carbon pricing due to the carbon footprint of our production facilities.

Our sites in Kundl (Austria), Lendava (Slovenia), Menges (Slovenia) and Ringaskiddy (Ireland) are all subject to the EU’s carbon pricing mechanism (EU ETS), while our site in Grimsby (UK) is subject, as of 2021, to the UK ETS, which closely tracks the EU ETS.

The benchmark price for EU carbon allowances has been on an upward trajectory for the most part of the past few years, rising from EUR 5 a ton in 2017 to over EUR 80 a ton in 2021.

We estimate potential expo sure in a possible range of USD 19 million to USD 150.9 million related to the carbon price in 2030, according to our best current knowledge.

Please note that the quantification of our exposure was realized by Environmental Resources Manage ment and that these numbers might change significantly in the future.

The most common types of global risk events are heat events, wildfires, water stress scarcity, cyclones and flooding from sea level rise or severe weather events.

Our exposure to physical risk due to flooding and cyclones was estimated using scenario analysis based on Representa tive Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5, which represent a best case and a worst case scenario of potential dis ruption to Novartis operations.

Reasonable best and worst risk exposures in 2030 range from USD 80 million to USD 112 million, and in 2050 range from USD 151 million to USD 163 million.

Please note that the quantification of our exposure was realized by Environmental Resources Management and that these numbers might change significantly in the future.

The current revenue generated in these mar kets is USD 27.5 billion.

This is also an opportunity, as success in decarbonizing ahead of our competitors may open up more opportunities for revenue in these markets.

Potential exposure is USD 27.5 billion if Novartis products are not net zero by country specific deadlines leading up to 2050.

Please note that the quantification of our exposure was realized by Envi ronmental Resources Management and that these numbers might change significantly in the future.

Further work is already underway and will be completed in 2022 to provide greater clarity on physical and transition risks upstream and downstream in our supply chain, and on risks to our core business related to loss of biodiversity and the bur geoning impact of climate change on human health.

This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of the internal control system related to the preparation of the Novartis in Society Integrated Report that are free from material misstate ment, whether due to fraud or error.

Furthermore, the Board of Directors is responsible for the selection and application of the criteria and adequate record keeping.

PricewaterhouseCoopers AG applies Swiss Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive sys tem of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, pro fessional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Inter national Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (revised) Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information’.

This standard requires that we plan and perform procedures to obtain limited assurance about whether the ESG performance indicators outlined within the Scope and subject matter section above was pre pared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the criteria as outline within the Criteria section above.

Based on risk and materiality considerations, we performed our procedures to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence.

The procedures selected depend on the assurance practitioner’s judgement.

The evidence gathering procedures were more limited than they would be on a reasonable assurance engagement and, therefore, less assurance was obtained than would be on a reasonable assurance engagement.

We performed the following procedures, among others: Review of application of the Novartis Corporate Responsibility Guideline Interviewing personnel responsible for internal reporting and data collection Performing tests on a sample basis of evidence supporting selected ESG data concerning completeness, accuracy, ade quacy, and consistency.

Inspecting relevant documentation on a sample basis, including Novartis ESG policies, management reporting structures and documentation.

Review of the management reporting processes for ESG reporting and assessing the consolidation process of data at.

Inspecting the principles of the Novartis materiality assessment process providing the basis for the adherence to the GRI reporting requirements, addressing the soundness of the methodology, the identification process, the determination of the impacted stakeholders, as well as the prioritization based on the assessed impact of Novartis.

We have not carried out any work on data other than outlined in the Scope and subject matter section as defined above.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.

CoNCLUsioN Based on the work we performed, nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that the ESG perfor mance indicators outlined within the Scope and subject matter section above of Novartis AG for the period ended Decem ber 31, 2021 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria as outline within the Criteria section above.

Our Assurance Report should therefore be read in connection with the criteria as outline within the Criteria section above.

Sustainability reporting helps organizations set goals, measure 
performance and manage change in order to have the greatest 
impact and make their operations more economically, environ- 
mentally and socially responsible.

  Our Process

  To better understand which issues are most important to our internal and external 

stakeholders, we follow an ongoing assessment process, which includes:

• Measurement against sector environmental, social and governance (ESG)  
performance benchmarks, including the SAM Corporate Sustainability  
Assessment

• Review of the United Nations Global Compact Principles and Sustainable  

Development 

• Review of data points, guidance and feedback from third-party ESG rating 

agencies and reporting frameworks, including the Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB) and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

• Review of data points from the JUST 100 survey, which is informed by public 
opinion research—a critical resource, given that Anthem serves more than  
118 million people

• Direct engagement with the stakeholder groups listed at right

  Product and Plan Service Description. Various forms of managed care  

products have been developed to contain the cost of healthcare by negotiating 
contracts with hospitals, physicians and other providers to deliver high-quality 
healthcare to members at favorable rates. These products usually feature  
medical management and other quality and cost optimization measures such  
as pre-admission review and approval for certain non-emergency services, 
pre-authorization of outpatient surgical procedures, network credentialing to 
determine that network physicians and hospitals have the required certifica-
tions and expertise, and various levels of care management programs to help 
members better understand and navigate the healthcare system. In addition, 
providers may have incentives to achieve certain quality measures, may share 

 7     Anthem 2021 ESG Report     General Disclosures & Economics    GRI/SASB Indices  

medical cost risk or may have other incentives to deliver quality medical  
services in a cost-effective manner. Also, certain plans offer members incentives  
for healthy behaviors, such as smoking cessation and weight management. 
Members are charged periodic, prepaid premiums and generally pay  
co-payments, coinsurance and/or deductibles when they receive services. 

  We offer a broad spectrum of network-based managed care risk-based plans  

to Individual, Group, Medicaid and Medicare markets. In addition, we provide  
a broad array of managed care services to fee-based customers, including claims 
processing, stop-loss insurance, provider network access, medical management, 
care management and wellness programs, actuarial services and other adminis-
trative services. We also provide services to the federal government in connec-
tion with our Federal Health Products & Services business, which administers 
the Federal Employees Health Benefits (“FEHB”) Program. We provide an array 
of specialty services both to our subsidiary health plans and also unaffiliated 
health plans, including PBM and behavioral health services and dental, vision, 
life, disability and supplemental health insurance benefits, as well as a diverse 
set of integrated health services.

of humanity. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 98,200 associates. 
To learn how Anthem fosters a diverse, inclusive, and high-performance culture, 
please see the Workplace section, pages 18–23.

  Supply Chain

GRI 102-9

Supply chain

  Anthem’s Global Supply Chain function facilitates partnerships with hundreds of 
suppliers, managing over $7 billion of indirect spending in products and services. 

  Supplier Code of Conduct. Our robust Supplier Code of Conduct—which 
addresses topics such as human and labor rights, anticorruption policies, 
workplace safety standards, and responsible paper-use guidelines—is contained 
in our supplier contracts; suppliers are required to acknowledge and attest to it 
on a regular basis. The code sets expectations, in alignment with Anthem’s 
values, for how our suppliers do business.

  Segmentation. Anthem has a defined supplier segmentation process that 
categorizes each supplier and assigns a risk ranking so appropriate levels of due 
diligence and ongoing oversight can be maintained. Suppliers are segmented 
based on (i) spending, (ii) value, (iii) operational risk and (iv) strategic risk 
criteria into four tiers that determine the level of oversight to be applied, with 
the sharpest focus placed on our tier 1 and 2 suppliers.

  Supplier Diversity. Supplier diversity is an integral part of the way we do business 
and one important way we improve the economic health of our communities. 
Our comprehensive Supplier Diversity program creates economic opportunities 
for underrepresented communities by procuring products and services from 
small, minority, women, veteran, veteran disabled, service disabled, lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ), disability-owned business enterprises 
as well as HUBZone.

  Our supplier diversity team works with business partners from across Anthem 

to ensure that diverse suppliers are included in sourcing opportunities. In 
addition, community partnerships, such as the Mid-States Minority Supplier 
Development Council, help us to identify, nurture, and expand our supply base. 

  In 2021, Anthem’s tier 1 (direct) and 2 (indirect) spend with diverse and small 
businesses totaled approximately $1 billion.

Environment

As a health company, we recognize the link between environmental 
health and the health of our customers and communities. Anthem 
is committed to continually improving the environmental sustain-
ability of our operations and business activities and is focused  
on the future well-being of the world around us. Our reporting 
aligns with the recommendations from the Task Force for Climate- 
Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and follows the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI), and the Sustainability Accounting   
Standards Board (SASB) frameworks.  

  Governance

  The board’s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.

  The Governance Committee oversees climate-related issues. Several Directors 
have experience with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters,  
specifically contributing to the Board’s understanding of leading corporate  
governance practices and environmental and social sustainability initiatives. 
Committee duties and responsibilities include monitoring Anthem’s environ-
mental sustainability initiatives and performance. Anthem’s Chief Sustainability 
Officer (CSO) updates the Governance Committee twice annually on ESG- 
related matters, including climate strategy.

  Climate-related issues will appear on the agenda of the Audit Committee if  
identified as a significant risk under the enterprise risk management (ERM) 
framework. If climate-related issues meet ERM thresholds aligned to the enter-
prise risk appetite, then mitigations, controls, and strategy will be reviewed by 
the Audit Committee. This includes the setting of key risk indicators/metrics  
to facilitate the ongoing monitoring and management of climate-related risks.  
The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports directly to the Audit Committee of the 
Board, with administrative reporting to the Chief Financial Officer.

  Management’s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks  
and opportunities.

  Management’s Role 

  Anthem’s company-wide environmental policy, strategy, and goals are overseen 

by the Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. Anthem’s CSO is  
responsible for establishing our strategy, reporting on environmental sustain-
ability initiatives, and identifying climate-related risks and opportunities. 

  Anthem’s CSO partners with the CRO and/or ERM team to identify potential 

climate-related risks via an ongoing risk assessment informed by independent 
external consultants. If any significant risks are found, those risks are elevated to 
the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC). The CRO provides a formal ERM update to 
the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis and to the full Board at least annually. 
The CRO is responsible for coordinating with risk owners in defining, developing, 
and implementing strategies to address the risk management challenges facing 
the organization, including climate-related risks. 

  These strategies enable the organization to determine the most-effective ways to 
avoid, mitigate, and/or communicate the critical risks faced. The ERC meets on a 
quarterly basis to govern the ERM program and identify the most-significant risks. 
This also includes reviewing mitigation strategies and key-risk indicators. During 
each ERC meeting, the risk thresholds and risk register are reviewed to consider  
if risks, including climate-related risks, require further inquiry and oversight.

  Environmental Policy & Commitments

  Our company-wide environmental approach includes:

  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Accounting and Reporting. Reduce our scope I and  
scope II GHG emissions by 46% by 2030 (2019 baseline). Remain committed to 
an annual GHG accounting practice with third-party assurance in accordance 
with the ISO14064-3 standard. Results are reported through CDP, a not-for-profit 
charity that runs the global disclosure system for managing environmental 
impacts. 

 15     Anthem 2021 ESG Report     Environment     TCFD/GRI/SASB Indices  

  Energy and Water Use. Reduce our energy and water use through efficiency 

  Alternative Associate Commuting. Reduce our GHG footprint by promoting 

initiatives, including LED lighting retrofits, advanced HVAC controls, Xeriscape, 
and data-center optimization. Continually track and benchmark all self-managed 
offices and data centers in ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager. Procure 100% 
renewable electricity for all our offices through power-purchase agreements 
or onsite installations. We are committed to the global corporate renewable-
energy initiative known as RE100, with the goal of using 100 percent renewable 
electricity by 2025.1

  Waste Management. Reduce landfilled/incinerated materials by promoting 

waste-management best practices across our sites to maximize diversion from 
landfill/incineration, dispose of our waste responsibly, and reduce overall waste. 
These efforts include:

• Paper Stewardship. Focus on source-reduction opportunities via paperless 
technology initiatives and strategies that engage associates, providers, and 
customers. Upon request, require major paper suppliers to document the 
sustainability of fiber sources and production techniques through credible, 
independent third-party certification programs.

• Disposal Practices. Partner with an electronic waste hauler that follows 

internationally recognized responsible disposal practices with strong chains  
of custody, including e-Stewards and WEEELABEX.

• Composting. Offer commercial composting in major offices where hauler 

services are available.

  Reduced Business Travel. Improve the average fuel efficiency, in miles per 
gallon, of company-owned vehicles by 5 percent year-over-year from a 2019 
baseline. Replace vehicles at the end of their useful lives with more-efficient 
models, including hybrids and electric vehicles where feasible. Continue to 
improve and assess our policy as market efficiency standards progress. Offer 
sophisticated and reliable video technology to encourage virtual meetings 
rather than those that involve travel. Maintain a strict travel-approval policy 
based on business necessity.

the use of low-carbon modes of commuting (e.g., ride sharing, public 
transportation, biking) by our associates. Provide electric-vehicle charging 
stations at all major self-managed office locations. Support a robust work-at-
home program.

  Certified Buildings. Ensure certified healthy, sustainable workplaces for all 

major renovations and new construction at Anthem. Leverage the LEED, Fitwel, 
and ENERGY STAR® certification programs for self-managed offices larger than 
50,000 square feet.

  Supply Chain. Survey, assess, and engage with strategic supply-chain partners 
for ESG performance. Engage with partners on setting their own scope I and 
scope II science-based GHG emission targets by 2023.

  Climate Resiliency. Support members and communities impacted by climate-
related events. Potential examples include securing battery powered, portable 
power stations for individuals reliant on electricity-dependent durable medical 
equipment (DME) and/or assistive technology, such as ventilators, oxygen 
concentrators and infusion pumps. Helping providers and members obtain early 
prescription refills, replacement of DME or supplies, and/or waiving notification 
time limits for medical necessity review.

  Risk Management

  Anthem’s risk management processes and execution are managed by a strong 
governance and risk culture. Varying levels of risk are handled at the appropriate 
level of management, coordinated among the different risk management functions, 
and escalated rapidly when appropriate based on well-communicated thresholds. 

  Identification and Assessment

  Risks may be identified for various diverse channels. Formal risk identification 

and assessment are conducted at all lines of accountability (e.g., IT, Sustainability/ 
ESG, Information Security, Corporate Security, Compliance, Internal Audit) on an 

 1  In 2021, Anthem achieved its goal of using 100 percent renewable electricity.

 16     Anthem 2021 ESG Report     Environment     TCFD/GRI/SASB Indices  

ongoing basis and shared horizontally across the organization as well as vertically 
to the appropriate stakeholders. The output of the Company’s risk assessments 
serve as inputs to the ERM program. Regular coordination is facilitated through 
a formal risk working group (with ESG representation), which includes a stand-
ing agenda item of risk identification and prioritization. Identified enterprise 
risks are assigned formal owners, who have clear responsibilities, which include 
defining the appropriate response strategy, identifying relevant metrics and  
key risk indicators, and monitoring and reporting risks on an ongoing basis.  
The potential long-term effects of the top enterprise risks are quantified and 
analyzed against the Company’s strategies, growth plan, and objectives.

  Climate-related Risks and Opportunities

  Climate-related risks and opportunities are treated the same way other risk 
categories are and may be identified through formal and informal risk assessments.

  Anthem has engaged an external consultant specializing in climate-related 

matters to assist management in conducting a climate-related risk assessment 
that includes:

  Alignment with Current ERM. Facilitates discussions with the ERM team,  

as well as reviews past and current risk assessment materials, and reviews and 
aligns with ERM program definitions of materiality.

  Stakeholder Engagement. Discusses climate-related risks with other internal 

business units that deal with risk, including Business Continuity, Product Pricing, 
and Treasury, to identify whether climate-related risks were included in the 
assessment process and if so, how.

  Screening Assessment. Works to determine if current climate-related risks 

were deemed material to the business lines and whether future climate 
scenarios were considered in this determination.

  Gap Analysis. Analyzes our current risk process across ERM and the business 

lines relative to the TCFD recommendations. Identifies gaps and makes 
recommendations for improvement.

  Through our current assessment, we have not identified any climate-related 
risks or opportunities with potential for substantive financial or strategic 
impact. We define “substantive financial or strategic impact” as climate-related 
risks and/or opportunities that have a moderate possibility of occurring and 
are of importance to the achievement of the Company’s business objectives 
and strategies, and complying with applicable laws, regulations, contractual 
requirements and policies. Factors that may have a substantive impact and may 
be influenced by climate change include, but not limited to, major legislation 
changes, macroeconomic issues, competition, financial variance due to 
unanticipated or adverse economic conditions, or operational events. We have 
business continuity and resource recovery plans in place to mitigate physical 
climate-related risks as they currently exist. We are a national business with 
operations in diverse geographical locations; therefore, physical effects in a 
single region do not dramatically affect the overall business. We lease rather 
than own a majority of our office properties, including our principal location in 
Indianapolis, Indiana. 

  Our product pricing business unit uses a short-term pricing model that is updated 
every 12-18 months. It is done regionally and takes into consideration changing 
health patterns and outcomes from the recent past (2-5 years). As chronic, physical 
climate-related risks may affect long-term public health (e.g., increased respiratory 
illness due to worsening air quality), this data will factor into new product 
pricing and new initiatives to improve the health of our customers, associates, 
and communities as health concerns begin to materialize in the general public.

  Diversity and Equal Opportunity
  We take pride in cultivating a diverse and inclusive workforce of high-performing 
associates who are reimagining healthcare solutions and experiences for all 
people. Our associates’ diversity provides us with valuable cultural insights, 
perspectives, and experiences that help us better understand the needs of  
those we serve.  

  Our diversity, equity, and inclusion framework is aligned to our enterprise  

strategy, focusing on four key areas: 

  Talent. Empower a diverse workforce to thrive.
  Environment. Enable inclusive and innovative experiences.
  Community. Enrich skilled, just, and healthier communities.
  Health. Educate and engage to improve care and outcomes.

  Diversity is one of the five Anthem values, and we expect our leaders and  

associates to champion diversity and to foster an inclusive and trusting environ-
ment. We encourage diverse perspectives and provide feedback and coaching  
to help our associates learn, grow, and develop every day. 

  Business Resource Groups

  Anthem’s nine business resource groups (BRGs) closely align with our organiza-

tion’s business objectives and our diversity, equity, and inclusion strategic 
priorities. Our BRGs engage nearly 20% of our workforce and offer members  
the opportunity to develop their leadership skills, help drive community health 
initiatives, and be allies who influence Anthem’s culture of inclusion and  
collaboration. 

  Talent Acquisition 

  To support Anthem’s commitment to hiring a diverse workforce, we partner  

with external organizations, colleges and universities, our nine internal business 
resource groups, and other internal associates to recruit, retain, and develop top 
talent. Our internship program ensures that we are building a diverse talent 
pipeline for the future. Anthem continues to promote employment efforts for 
veterans and individuals with disabilities. Additionally, Anthem has implemented 
intentional steps within the selection process to mitigate potential biases, 
attract diverse candidates, and increase objectivity in interviewing, calibrating, 
and selecting the most qualified candidates.

Employee engagement as a percentage

  In 2020, we partnered with a third party to conduct a complex gender and race 
pay equity analysis, which confirmed that the roles our associates play and their 
performance, experience, and geographic location are the main predictors of 
pay. After accounting for factors such as age, performance rating, and level of 
education, the analysis found that base pay for females and people of color is 
within one percentage point of their male and white counterparts. To prevent 
unexplained pay gaps and ensure that we remain a champion of pay equity 
for all associates, we will continue to monitor our pay practices and diligently 
address cases that cannot be explained by objective factors.

  In 2021, Fair Pay Workplace named us to its inaugural list of certified Fair Pay 
Workplaces after completing a detailed evaluation process. This certification  
is the first step in an ongoing, comprehensive process based on detailed third-
party statistical measures designed to measure, evaluate, and sustain fair pay 
practices across gender, race, and ethnicity at Anthem.

to WorkTM certification, which included surveying a representative sample of associates.

   Engagement Surveys. To help make Anthem a great place to work, we regularly 
survey our associates to assess their engagement and identify areas for  
improvement, including job roles, benefits and the workplace climate. Based on 
the insights we gain, Anthem’s leaders build action plans and share them with 
associates at town halls and team meetings.

  Associate Experience. Through our innovative, patented Vitals associate  
engagement platform, Anthem is able to account daily for associates’ perspectives 
when designing internal initiatives to respond to issues such as COVID-19, return 
to office, the hybrid workplace and labor market/Great Resignation challenges. 
In 2021, Anthem associates shared more than 53,500 comments and more  
than 317,000 sentiment submissions on Anthem’s always-listening digital Vitals 
application.

Community

  At Anthem, we believe that health is so much more than healthcare. 
Where we live, our racial and ethnic backgrounds, our economic 
security, our access to nutritious foods and reliable transportation, 
and other social and environmental factors all affect our health. 
Called social drivers, these factors influence up to 80% of health 
outcomes.

  As an organization that is committed to, connected to, and 
invested in our communities, we champion innovative, sustainable, 
and equitable solutions to the issues that influence the health of 
our communities.

  Anthem Foundation

  As the philanthropic arm of Anthem, Inc., the Anthem Foundation promotes 
the organization’s commitment to improving lives and communities. Building 
on more than 20 years’ experience with improving the health of disadvantaged 
communities, the Foundation has refined its strategy to underscore this 
commitment, and a tightened focus will allow us to make a bigger impact.

  Over the next three years, the Foundation will invest up to $90 million in 

partnerships and programs that can demonstrate change in these crucial areas 
and address racial inequities and health disparities:

  Maternal and Child Health. The Foundation is supporting maternal health 

programs ranging from prenatal care to equity training and access to mental 
health support.  

  Food as Medicine. The Foundation is focusing on programs that reduce the 

number of food-insecure individuals and help prevent the onset of diet-related 
health conditions. Our goal is to create greater access to healthy and nutritious 
food by improving affordable, healthy food options among food-insecure 
populations.

  Substance Use Disorder. The Foundation is focusing on programs that work 

to address an array of care and service options, including prevention and early 
intervention, crisis response and intervention, long-term intervention, and 
community resources and recovery supports.

  Disaster Relief. Recognizing that disasters strike when and where we least 
expect them, the Anthem Foundation supports organizations focused on 
disaster preparedness and on response and recovery efforts.

  Associate Engagement

  Flu/COVID-19 Vaccine Campaigns

  Giving back to our communities is the fabric of Anthem’s culture, and it has 
never been more necessary. We support our associates’ engagement with 
qualified charitable organizations through a range of programs.

  Dollars for Dollars. Anthem associates give generously to health-related 
nonprofit organizations across the country through our Dollars for Dollars 
program with a 1:1 match from the Anthem Foundation. In 2021, nearly $7 million 
was raised.  

  Dollars for Doers. The Dollars for Doers program encourages associates to 
volunteer year-round—and helps them further commit to their communities 
by offering rewards that the associates can direct to charities they choose. 
While 2021 posed special challenges, Anthem associates rose to the occasion 
and volunteered over 91,000 hours, virtually and in person, generating more 
than $720,000 in Dollars for Doers rewards that were distributed to community 
nonprofits.  

  Anthem Volunteer Days. The Anthem Volunteer Days program, made possible 
through a partnership with Lions Clubs International, has engaged more than 
10,000 volunteers, who have donated 27,500 hours of service in hundreds of 
projects benefiting two million Americans since 2015.

  Volunteer Time Off. We offer time off to help associates support organizations 
that are important to them. Full-time associates receive up to eight hours of 
paid time to volunteer at qualified charities of their choice during work hours. 

  Anthem is committed to providing science-based, factual information to 
help individuals make well-informed decisions about both COVID-19 and Flu 
vaccinations. We believe in a person-centered approach to health and wellness, 
exemplified by our grassroots communications approach to meeting people 
where they’re at and sharing these resources throughout trusted community 
hubs where people live, work, and play.

  The enterprise vaccination strategy focuses on vulnerable populations as 
defined by the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and those with mid-range vaccine 
hesitancy. This focus allows Anthem to better identify a target population, 
establish efficiencies with cohesive vaccination approach, and improve health 
equality and outcomes in the communities we serve.

  Specific to COVID-19, Anthem Foundation and the American Lung Association 
leveraged the expertise of several nationally recognized organizations representing 
communities of color to develop the Better For It Series —a suite of toolkits 
using culturally competent messaging and imagery to discuss the science 
behind, and dispel myths about, the COVID-19 vaccination.

  Additionally in preparation for Flu season, Anthem Foundation and the American 
Lung Association launched the Fend Off Flu campaign targeting key audiences 
of healthcare providers, employers, and older adults—designed to increase 
influenza knowledge and vaccination acceptance rates.

Political contributions

  As one of the nation’s leading health companies, Anthem plays a key role  
advocating national health care policy and practices to benefit the public. 
Healthcare is an increasingly regulated and legislated industry both at the federal 
and state level. Elected officials make decisions that directly affect our ability  
to make quality healthcare coverage affordable and to improve the health of  
the communities we serve. Our active participation in the political process is  
essential to ensure that we have a voice in those decisions. At Anthem, we are 
committed to advocating public policy solutions that best serve our customers, 
our stakeholders, our associates, and our communities.

Customer Privacy & Technology Solutions  

SASB HC-MC-230a.1 Description of policies and practices to secure customers’  

protected health information (“PHI”) records and other  
personally identifiable information (“PII”)

  Approach 

  Anthem maintains a comprehensive enterprise-wide privacy and information 
security program, which is governed at the Board of Directors level by the Audit 
Committee. The focus of the program is to:

  •  Safeguard customers’ and clients’ confidential information
  •  Maintain a cross-functional incident response program to detect and respond  
  to suspected events
  •  Train and educate Anthem associates on our security program and  
  relevant industry trends
  •  Maintain oversight of our relevant vendors’ observance of Anthem’s security  
  requirements 
  •  Align with regulatory and statutory requirements, including HIPAA, HITECH,  
  and GLBA

  HITRUST

  The HITRUST CSF is an overarching security and privacy framework that 
incorporates and leverages the existing security requirements placed upon 
healthcare organizations, including federal (e.g., HIPAA and HITECH), state,  
third party (e.g., ISO, PCI and COBIT), and other government agencies  
(e.g., NIST, FTC, and CMS).

  Anthem achieved HITRUST CSF Certified status in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2018, and 
2020 for Anthem’s Commercial Business Environment (WGS Claims), and in 
2016, 2018, and 2020 for Anthem’s Government Business Division (GBD Facets). 
Certification was obtained through the HITRUST CSF Assurance Program, based 
on the most widely used information security and privacy framework used by 
United States and global healthcare organizations.  Anthem’s 2020 HITRUST CSF 

 
 30     Anthem 2021 ESG Report     Customers    GRI/SASB Indices  

Assessments were performed by an independent third-party services firm that is 
authorized to perform HITRUST CSF Assessments. HITRUST performed interim 
certification reviews in the intervening years, including 2021, and verified that 
Anthem continued to meet HITRUST certification requirements. Assessment 
efforts are underway to achieve certification for both the Commercial and 
Government Business Divisions again in 2022. Anthem is committed to maintaining 
HITRUST certification, including undergoing assessments every two years by 
independent third-party services firms.

  Please note that a portion of our executives’ annual incentive compensation  
is based on Star Ratings, which is considered an ESG measure focused on 
achieving Medicare goals that most significantly improve clinical outcomes.  
For additional information, please see our 2022 Proxy Statement, page 50. 

  Our health plans are rated for quality and performance by the National Committee 
for Quality Assurance (NCQA). Our ability to promote quality medical care has 
been recognized by NCQA, which is the largest and most respected national 
accreditation program for managed care health plans. Several quality healthcare 
measures, including the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set 
(“HEDIS®”), have been incorporated into NCQA’s accreditation processes. 

 
 31     Anthem 2021 ESG Report     Customers    GRI/SASB Indices  

HEDIS® measures range from preventive services, such as screening mammog-
raphy and pediatric immunization, to elements of care, including decreasing the 
complications of diabetes, improving treatment for patients with heart disease, 
integration of behavioral health, and racial and ethnic stratification measure-
ment to help close healthcare disparities.

  Virtual Primary Care 

  In April 2021, Hydrogen Health, our joint venture with investment firm Blackstone 
and digital primary care company K Health, launched our virtual primary care 
offerings. After successfully rolling out our services with Hydrogen Health this 
past summer, the joint venture is expanding to multiple Fortune 500 employers 
and large regional health plans, with the goal to serve an additional 10 million 
people by the end of 2022. While making care navigation a more seamless  
process, we are preventing unnecessary emergency room visits by treating 
people early and often, which has the potential to reduce up to 20% of current 
healthcare costs in America.

  Digital Health Options

  We have seen a continued expansion of our digital platform for health. Our  
digital capabilities, coupled with our platform strategy and data creates a 
unique opportunity to unify and orchestrate today’s fragmented ecosystem—
driving value for customers by helping them reduce cost of care and improve 
health outcomes.

  In 2021, Sydney Health, Anthem’s digital engagement platform for health plan 
members, had more than 53 million digital interactions, a 24% increase from 
the previous year. Much of this increase was driven by an 82% increase in the 
number of members using the Sydney Health app in 2021 compared to the prior 
year. We now have over 10 million members registered on our Sydney Health  
platform. The Sydney Health app gives members access to virtual care services, 
personalized health and wellness resources, and medical, pharmacy, dental, 
vision, life, and disability benefit details—all in one place.

  Access to Preventative-Care Services

  In 2021, approximately 95% of Anthem’s risk-based enrollees had access to  

preventive health services with no cost-sharing. Approximately 87% of Anthem’s 
Medicare, Medicaid, and HMO/PPO commercial members1 received preventive 
health services as defined by the HEDIS measure Adults’ Access to Preventive/
Ambulatory Health Services (AAP). This measure assesses whether adult health 
plan members had a preventive or ambulatory visit to their physician. Health-
care visits are an opportunity for individuals to receive preventive services and 
counseling on topics such as diet and exercise. These visits also can help them 
to address acute issues or manage chronic conditions.

  We continue to expand our suite of integrated care management programs  

and tools and offer the following programs, among others, which are available to 
our members depending on the particular plan or product in which they  
participate, and have been designed to increase quality and reduce medical 
costs for our members:

  •  ConditionCare and FutureMoms
  •  MyHealth Advantage
  •  MyHealth Coach
  •  HealthyLifestyles
  •  Wellbeing Coach
  •  Behavioral Health Case Management

  For additional information, please see our 2021 Form 10-K, page 13.

  Home-Based Care

  In 2021, we acquired myNEXUS, Inc., a comprehensive home-based nursing 

management company. myNEXUS delivers integrated clinical support services 
for Medicare Advantage members across numerous states. It deploys a user- 
friendly platform for providers to highly automate the home visit authorization 
process, increase provider effectiveness, and improve member satisfaction. The 

digital platform combines an advanced analytic rules engine with a clinical staff 
to effectively plan for and optimize home care. myNEXUS is a technology-driven 
care and benefit management service that enables individuals to live healthier 
lives in their homes. 

  Whole Health Index

  Anthem developed the Whole Health Index (WHI) to measure member health 
holistically with a single score that takes community, social, and clinical drivers 
into account. This helps us see the larger picture and better informs our efforts 
to improve outcomes for members, associates, and communities. 

  The index assesses:

  Global Health. Presence of conditions and diseases
  Social Drivers.  Factors including socioeconomic status, household composi-

tion, housing, transportation, affordability, and access to food

  Clinical Quality. Appropriateness of care, preventive care, and the quality of care

  The WHI helps improve individual health and supports Anthem’s goals for 

improving health equity. It enables us to see where larger scale investments and 
solutions are most needed. 

  Value-Based Care 

  Anthem is partnering with healthcare providers to improve the quality and  

affordability of healthcare through value-based care models, with 60% of our 
2021 healthcare spend being in value-based arrangements. We increased the 
amount we paid healthcare providers through value-based payments by over 
20% in 2021, including amounts to reward them for reducing the cost of care 
and improving healthcare outcomes for our customers. We are also focused on 
increasing the percentage of our customers seeing a high-performing primary 
care provider to ensure strong cost and quality performance. At the end of 2021, 
we saw a 180-basis point improvement year-over-year in the percentage of the 
customers we serve attributed to high-performing providers.

  Enhanced Personal Health Care (EPHC). As the largest private value-based 
payment program in the country for providers participating in commercial, 
Medicare, and Medicaid segments across all Anthem markets, EPHC is helping 
strengthen our care-provider relationships. Participating providers receive 
upfront clinical coordination payments to help fund investment in care 
coordination and technology and are rewarded for high-quality care. Providers 
have access to clinical and performance reports that target waste, overuse, 
and costly gaps in care. In addition, we offer high-performing primary care 
providers greater opportunities for bonuses in exchange for delivering better 
member outcomes and experiences, while episodic and medical home models 
in the specialty space reward providers for great care coordination under 
high-complexity, high-cost conditions. Under our standard Commercial EPHC 
program, we currently have 200 accountable care organizations and 77,000 
providers who manage 7.3 million lives.

  COVID-19 Pandemic 

  Anthems continues to assist customers, providers, members, and communities  
in addressing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including by providing  
expanded benefit coverage for COVID-19 diagnostic tests and vaccine  
administration and taking steps to increase vaccinations by enabling, educating, 
and encouraging vaccine acceptance among our members as well as in the  
communities in which we operate.

  Since the beginning of the pandemic, Anthem has provided more than $4 billion 
in financial support to ease the burden COVID-19 has placed on our customers, 
providers, and communities. This assistance includes extended cost-share waivers, 
customer premium credits, provider grants, and other community support.

  Health Equity 

  Anthem is dedicated to advancing health equity so that all people, regardless of 
race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, and geographic 
or financial access can receive individualized care that brings them to their 
most optimal level of health. While we have comprehensive, long-term goals 
to advance health equity for all people, in the near-term, we have prioritized 
three areas to drive more immediate progress of care delivery and equitable 
experience: maternal health, behavioral health, and pharmacy.

  Maternal Health. We are working with other Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans 
across the U.S. to reduce racial disparities in maternal health by 50% in 5 years. 
Beginning in 2021, the Compensation and Talent Committee added a Health 
of Humanity metric in our executive compensation program, which includes 
a maternal health component. A portion of our executives’ annual incentive 
compensation is based on the improvement in maternity health outcomes and 
reduction of pre-term births for black communities in Indiana.

United Nations Global Compact
United Nations Global Compact

The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) is the world’s largest 
corporate sustainability initiative and is a call to companies to align 
with universal principles on human rights, labor, the environment, 
and anticorruption, and take actions that advance societal goals.  
In July 2020, Anthem made a commitment to support the Ten  
Principles of the UNGC with the intent of implementing those 
principles across our enterprise. 

  Human Rights and Labor

  Businesses should:

  Principle 1:   Support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed

human rights

  Principle 2:  Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses

  Principle 3:   Uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition 

of the right to collective bargaining

  Principle 4:  Support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor

  Principle 5:  Support the effective abolition of child labor

  Principle 6:   Support the elimination of discrimination in respect of    

employment and occupation

  Anthem supports the basic, fundamental rights of all people. In addition to 
following applicable laws, our company’s practices and policies promote a 
culture where individuals are respected and their rights are protected. 

  These policies extend to our affiliates, business partners, and suppliers, whom 
we expect to uphold the same level of respect for all individuals. Through our 
Supplier Code of Conduct, suppliers agree to policies that include fair labor 
practices, freedom from harassment, and ensured basic human rights.

  Anthem and its subsidiaries are committed to operating with the highest 

integrity in a manner consistent with the United Nations Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Specifically, we support collective 
bargaining in good faith with recognized unions.

   These fundamental labor principles include the prohibition of child labor, the 

prohibition of forced labor in all forms, freedom of association, and protection 
from discrimination.

  Discrimination includes employment decisions based on personal characteristics 
that are unrelated to the ability to do one’s job, including race, color, religion, 
sex, gender (including gender identity), age, national origin, marital status, 
sexual orientation, veteran status, disability, genetic information, and any other 
status or condition protected by applicable federal, state, or local laws, except 
where a bona fide occupational qualification applies.

   All Anthem associates are expected to complete Code of Conduct training 

on an annual basis and to report suspected human rights violations as well 
as cooperate in company investigations. Anthem takes all reports seriously, 
and retaliation for good-faith reporting is strictly prohibited. Please refer to 
Reporting Misconduct and Ethics Concerns on page 9 of this report.

   
 
 
 
 36     Anthem 2021 ESG Report     United Nations    Global Compact  

  Environment

  Businesses should:

  Anticorruption

  Businesses should:

  Principle 7:   Support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges

  Principle 10:  Work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion  

  Principle 8:   Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental  

 responsibility

  Principle 9:  Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally 

friendly technologies

  Please see the Environment section of this report, pages 13-17, for information 

on Anthem’s environmental policy, commitments, performance, and governance 
practices.

and bribery

  Anthem prohibits any form of bribery or corruption, whether in commercial 
dealings with private parties or in dealings with officials of any government.  
We are committed to complying with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the 
U.S. Travel Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and all other applicable antibribery laws. 

  We must not, directly, or indirectly through a third party, make or offer anything 
of value to anyone to improperly obtain or retain business. Nor may we 
improperly influence any action to benefit Anthem. “Anything of value” can 
include, but is not limited to, gifts, services, favors, and preferential hiring. 

  We must follow due diligence requirements before Anthem engages a third 
party to act on its behalf in conducting international business. Anthem 
has adopted approval procedures that must be followed when giving gifts, 
entertaining, and engaging in certain sales and marketing activities with 
government officials. These activities require prior review and approval. 

  “Facilitating or expediting payments” are made in furtherance of routine 
governmental action, and Anthem’s Global Anticorruption Policy prohibits the 
making or authorizing of such without prior review and approval by the Anthem 
Chief Accounting Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer, or their designees, 
and the Legal Department. A facilitating or expediting payment exception is 
very narrow and does not include a procurement decision to award new business 
or to convince a business to contract with a particular party.

Anthem’s CSO is responsible for establishing our strategy, reporting on environmental sustain ability initiatives, and identifying climate related risks and opportunities.

Anthem’s CSO partners with the CRO and or ERM team to identify potential climate related risks via an ongoing risk assessment informed by independent external consultants.

If any significant risks are found, those risks are elevated to the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC).

The CRO provides a formal ERM update to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis and to the full Board at least annually.

The CRO is responsible for coordinating with risk owners in defining, developing, and implementing strategies to address the risk management challenges facing the organization, including climate related risks.

These strategies enable the organization to determine the most effective ways to avoid, mitigate, and or communicate the critical risks faced.

The ERC meets on a quarterly basis to govern the ERM program and identify the most significant risks.

This also includes reviewing mitigation strategies and key risk indicators.

During each ERC meeting, the risk thresholds and risk register are reviewed to consider if risks, including climate related risks, require further inquiry and oversight.

Anthem’s risk management processes and execution are managed by a strong governance and risk culture.

Varying levels of risk are handled at the appropriate level of management, coordinated among the different risk management functions, and escalated rapidly when appropriate based on well communicated thresholds.

Risks may be identified for various diverse channels.

The output of the Company’s risk assessments serve as inputs to the ERM program.

Regular coordination is facilitated through a formal risk working group (with ESG representation), which includes a stand ing agenda item of risk identification and prioritization.

Identified enterprise risks are assigned formal owners, who have clear responsibilities, which include defining the appropriate response strategy, identifying relevant metrics and key risk indicators, and monitoring and reporting risks on an ongoing basis.

The potential long term effects of the top enterprise risks are quantified and analyzed against the Company’s strategies, growth plan, and objectives.

Climate related risks and opportunities are treated the same way other risk categories are and may be identified through formal and informal risk assessments.

Alignment with Current ERM. Facilitates discussions with the ERM team, as well as reviews past and current risk assessment materials, and reviews and aligns with ERM program definitions of materiality.

We define substantive financial or strategic impact as climate related risks and or opportunities that have a moderate possibility of occurring and are of importance to the achievement of the Company’s business objectives and strategies, and complying with applicable laws, regulations, contractual requirements and policies.

Factors that may have a substantive impact and may be influenced by climate change include, but not limited to, major legislation changes, macroeconomic issues, competition, financial variance due to unanticipated or adverse economic conditions, or operational events.

We have business continuity and resource recovery plans in place to mitigate physical climate related risks as they currently exist.

We are a national business with operations in diverse geographical locations therefore, physical effects in a single region do not dramatically affect the overall business.

We lease rather than own a majority of our office properties, including our principal location in Indianapolis, Indiana.

Our product pricing business unit uses a short term pricing model that is updated every 12 18 months.

It is done regionally and takes into consideration changing health patterns and outcomes from the recent past (2 5 years).

As chronic, physical climate related risks may affect long term public health (e.g., increased respiratory illness due to worsening air quality), this data will factor into new product pricing and new initiatives to improve the health of our customers, associates, and communities as health concerns begin to materialize in the general public.

In 2021, the total square footage was approximately 3 million square feet.

In 2021, we established a target to engage with 70% of our indirect spend supply chain on setting their own science based greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals by year end 2023.

In 2021, approximately 23% of our in scope supplier spend had established reduction goals.

After successfully rolling out our services with Hydrogen Health this past summer, the joint venture is expanding to multiple Fortune 500 employers and large regional health plans, with the goal to serve an additional 10 million people by the end of 2022.

While making care navigation a more seamless process, we are preventing unnecessary emergency room visits by treating people early and often, which has the potential to reduce up to 20% of current healthcare costs in America.

We have seen a continued expansion of our digital platform for health.

Our digital capabilities, coupled with our platform strategy and data creates a unique opportunity to unify and orchestrate today’s fragmented ecosystem driving value for customers by helping them reduce cost of care and improve health outcomes.

In 2021, Sydney Health, Anthem’s digital engagement platform for health plan members, had more than 53 million digital interactions, a 24% increase from the previous year.

Much of this increase was driven by an 82% increase in the number of members using the Sydney Health app in 2021 compared to the prior year.

We now have over 10 million members registered on our Sydney Health platform.

The Sydney Health app gives members access to virtual care services, personalized health and wellness resources, and medical, pharmacy, dental, vision, life, and disability benefit details all in one place.

In 2021, approximately 95% of Anthem’s risk based enrollees had access to preventive health services with no cost sharing.

Approximately 87% of Anthem’s Medicare, Medicaid, and HMO PPO commercial members1 received preventive health services as defined by the HEDIS measure Adults’ Access to Preventive Ambulatory Health Services (AAP).

This measure assesses whether adult health plan members had a preventive or ambulatory visit to their physician.

Health care visits are an opportunity for individuals to receive preventive services and counseling on topics such as diet and exercise.

These visits also can help them to address acute issues or manage chronic conditions.

Anthem is partnering with healthcare providers to improve the quality and affordability of healthcare through value based care models, with 60% of our 2021 healthcare spend being in value based arrangements.

We increased the amount we paid healthcare providers through value based payments by over 20% in 2021, including amounts to reward them for reducing the cost of care and improving healthcare outcomes for our customers.

We are also focused on increasing the percentage of our customers seeing a high performing primary care provider to ensure strong cost and quality performance.

At the end of 2021, we saw a 180 basis point improvement year over year in the percentage of the customers we serve attributed to high performing providers.

As the largest private value based payment program in the country for providers participating in commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid segments across all Anthem markets, EPHC is helping strengthen our care provider relationships.

Participating providers receive upfront clinical coordination payments to help fund investment in care coordination and technology and are rewarded for high quality care.

Providers have access to clinical and performance reports that target waste, overuse, and costly gaps in care.

In addition, we offer high performing primary care providers greater opportunities for bonuses in exchange for delivering better member outcomes and experiences, while episodic and medical home models in the specialty space reward providers for great care coordination under high complexity, high cost conditions.

Under our standard Commercial EPHC program, we currently have 200 accountable care organizations and 77,000 providers who manage 7.3 million lives.

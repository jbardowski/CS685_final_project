ABOUT THIS REPORT

This report covers calendar year 2021 and provides qualitative and quantitative information on 
our approach to managing our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) opportunities and 
risks. In some cases, we also share highlights from programs and initiatives that were launched  
in 2022 to provide more up-to-date information to our stakeholders. 

When we use the terms “American Express,” “company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” in this report, we 
mean the American Express Company and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, unless we 
state, or the context implies, otherwise. 

Reporting guidelines and content 

This report follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (SASB), and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting 
guidelines with respect to our priority ESG issues. GRI, SASB, and TCFD indexes can be found  
in the Supporting Data section of the report. 

In this report, the use of the term “materiality” and other similar terms is intended to reflect our 
priority ESG issues. We are not using such terms as they are used under the securities or other 
laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction or as these terms are used in the context of 
financial statements and financial reporting. 

We report on ESG issues that pertain to us through this ESG report and the American Express 
Corporate Sustainability website. Additional information about our company can be found 
through our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) Report, submissions to the CDP (formerly 
Carbon Disclosure Project), in our annual and quarterly reports and our proxy statement  
on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and on the American Express  
Investor Relations website. Links and references included throughout the report provide  
direction on where to find additional information. 

This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 
which are subject to risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements, including the company’s aspirational ESG 
commitments and goals, contain words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “aim,” “will,” “may,” “should,” 
“could,” “would,” “likely,” “potential,” “commit,” “continue,” or other similar expressions. Actual results may differ from those 
set forth in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including: competition, brand perceptions and 
reputation; an inability to develop and market value propositions that appeal to Card Members and new customers; the 
amount and efficacy of investments in product innovations, resources, marketing campaigns and programs; changing 
customer behaviors, interest in the company’s products, resources and programs, and willingness to access capital 
provided by the company, spend money at small businesses, and value environmentally and socially responsible products 
and services; management’s inability to identify suitable suppliers, grantees, partners and community investments and 
negotiate acceptable terms; the actual amount the company spends with suppliers, on ESG initiatives and to make 
appropriate salary adjustments, all while implementing operating expense control initiatives; an inability to build 
partnerships and execute programs with other companies and of partners to meet their obligations to the company; 
changes in developing standards and certifications; the cost and availability of renewable energy, carbon removal and 
carbon offset projects, energy attribute certificates, certified paper, and green buildings, and alternatives to single-use 
plastic; supply chain and market disruption; regulation; potential M&A activity; severe weather conditions, natural 
disasters and other catastrophic events; changes in the company’s real estate, technology, colleague and community 
engagement, and risk management strategies; an inability of waste management systems to divert waste to recycling and 
composting facilities; and changes in economic or business conditions and the company’s ability to grow, improve its 
financial performance and execute on its strategies. A further description of these and other risks and uncertainties can 
be found in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Annual Report”), 
the company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, and the company’s other filings with 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking

A MESSAGE FROM OUR CHAIRMAN AND CEO

American Express is built on trust, integrity, and service 
excellence. Living up to this legacy means doing what is  
right for our colleagues, customers, and communities. Our 
strength comes from the impact we can make on people’s 
lives—or what we call “the powerful backing of American 
Express”—and our ESG strategy is a natural extension of this. 

The myriad of challenges facing the world today, many 
unprecedented in our lifetime, underscore the importance  
of our powerful backing promise. We are now over two years 
into navigating the pandemic; the effects of climate change 
are more apparent than ever; macroeconomic and geopolitical 
instability is on the rise; and, just in the last few months, we 
have witnessed the war in Ukraine unfold into a devastating 
humanitarian crisis. 

Against this backdrop, we continue to back our colleagues, 
customers, and communities to drive positive impact.

“ Our strength comes from 
the impact we can make on 
people’s lives—or what we 
call “the powerful backing 
of American Express”— 
and our ESG strategy is a 
natural extension of this.”

As the way we live and work has evolved with the pandemic, 
we have been focused on creating a new work model that 
supports our colleagues. In March 2022, we officially launched 
Amex Flex, our new way of working that provides colleagues 
with the flexibility to work full time in the office, fully virtually, 
or a hybrid of both. 

Amex Flex is designed to recapture the creativity and 
collaboration of working together in person, while also 
retaining the agility and productivity we were able to achieve 
in a virtual environment during the pandemic. This approach 
also enables us to broaden the talent pool we can attract  
and strengthen retention as we provide colleagues with a 
compelling value proposition that offers choice, leading 
benefits, competitive compensation, and opportunities for 
growth and career advancement.

Our colleagues are critical to our success, and they are the 
driving force behind the impact we make in people’s lives  
and in the communities we serve. I am exceptionally proud of  
what we achieved to date on our ESG strategy, thanks to the 
dedication of our colleagues around the world who bring our 
company’s purpose to life. 

Advancing Our ESG Priorities
We announced our ESG framework in 2020, centered around 
three core priorities: Promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
(DE&I); Advance Climate Solutions; and Build Financial 
Confidence. Since then, we have solidified our strategy  
by developing a clear roadmap to translate our objectives  
into action. 

Promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I)

We are continuing to strengthen our culture of inclusion and 
belonging across the company and providing transparency 
into our efforts. In 2021, we published our inaugural DE&I 
Report, which included detailed disclosures on diversity 
representation among colleagues and our ongoing efforts to 
maintain a diverse and equitable workplace through inclusive 
hiring, career growth, retention, and equal pay practices. 

In addition to sharing our progress across these areas in 2021, 
in this report we have included additional details related to 
representation of our ethnically and racially diverse colleagues 
in the US. 

We also exceeded $1 billion in spending toward our DE&I Action 
Plan announced in October 2020. The plan supported our 
efforts to increase spending with underrepresented-owned 
suppliers, expanding access to capital and financial education 
and partnering with nonprofit organizations focused on 
promoting equality, among other initiatives.

To build on this momentum, I am pleased to announce an 
additional $3 billion—which means we now aim to spend  
$4 billion in total from late 2020 through 2025—toward our  
DE&I Action Plan and initiatives globally. The majority of 
additional spending will continue to be allocated with suppliers.

Advance Climate Solutions

We are focused on advancing solutions that address the  
climate crisis by minimizing our carbon footprint and helping 
our customers and communities do the same. 

Last year marked an important step forward for us, as we 
committed to net-zero emissions by 2035, in alignment with  
the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), building on our 
CarbonNeutral® operations powered by 100% renewable 
electricity since 2018. 

To reduce our environmental impact across our global real 
estate portfolio, we have spent more than $150 million since 
2019 on the development of facilities that have received green 
building certification. In addition to these investments, we  
have a goal to provide at least $10 million toward philanthropic 
efforts for climate action as part of our new community giving 
category: Backing Low-Carbon Communities. We have already 
pledged over $3 million in grants to support climate and 
nature-based solutions.

Last November, at the UN Climate Change Conference of  
the Parties (COP26), we joined the World Economic Forum’s 
Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition and Global Future  
Council on Sustainable Tourism to help promote sustainable 
travel practices. In addition, during Earth Month 2022, we 
announced several new low-carbon solutions in line with our 
2022 goal. These included new digital tools to help corporate 
clients better understand and manage their carbon footprint, 
such as a Carbon Footprint Dashboard and a Carbon Offset 

Referral Suite. We also announced a goal of having the vast 
majority of plastic cards issued by American Express made  
of at least 70% recycled or reclaimed plastic by the end of 
2024. We have already begun expanding our offerings to 
integrate recycled plastic into our cards worldwide, starting 
with Canada and France.

Build Financial Confidence

Rooted in our company’s purpose is helping people achieve 
their aspirations, not only through our differentiated 
products and services, but also through our investments  
to strengthen the financial well-being, security, and resilience 
of our communities. 

As a longstanding champion of small businesses, we continue  
to support business owners globally as they navigate new 
challenges from inflation, supply chain disruptions, and labor 
shortages, in addition to the ongoing impacts from the 
pandemic. Our Shop Small campaign is foundational to these 
efforts. Since 2020, we spent more than $300 million toward 
campaign initiatives to help jumpstart spending at small 
businesses. In November 2021, we held our 12th annual Small 
Business Saturday event, which reached an all-time high  
of $23.3 billion in estimated consumer spending at small 
businesses in the US.1 Consumers reported spending an 
estimated £598 million at small businesses in the UK on  
Small Business Saturday held on December 4, 2021,2 and both 
campaigns contributed toward our goal to drive $100 billion  
in consumer spending at small businesses through 2025. 

We also launched a new community giving category for building 
financial confidence, “Backing Small,” which supports small 
businesses by bringing together all our grant programs focused 
on supporting small business. We have already pledged  
$17 million to support Backing Small programs, including 
Inclusive Backing, in partnership with Main Street America, 
focused on underrepresented and economically vulnerable 
business-owners, and the second year of our Backing Historic 
Small Restaurants program across the US in 2022. 

Our new Backing International Small Restaurants program  
with the International Downtown Association is expanding  
our support beyond the US by helping culturally significant, 
independent restaurants operated by underserved populations 
and those in economic need in five major cities: London, 
Mexico City, Sydney, Tokyo, and Toronto.

We also deepened our focus on financial literacy, training,  
and mentoring programs for individuals and business owners 
through our community giving. Building on our longstanding 
partnership with Junior Achievement, we plan to offer bespoke 
financial literacy education and programs to more than 5,000 
students in 11 countries, focusing on underrepresented and 
underserved communities, through JA Worldwide. 

1.  The American Express 2021 Small Business Saturday Consumer Insights Survey was conducted by Teneo 
on behalf of American Express and the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). The study is  
a nationally representative sample of 2,426 U.S. adults 18 years of age or older. The sample was collected 
using an email invitation and an online survey. The study gathered self-reported data and does not reflect 
actual receipts or sales. It was conducted anonymously on November 28, 2021. The survey has an overall 
margin of error of +/- 2.0%, at the 95% level of confidence. Projections are based on the current U.S. 
Census estimates of the U.S. adult population, age 18 years and over.

2.  Estimated spend based on data collected from 4000 UK adults polled by Opinium between 5pm on 

Saturday 4 December 2021 and 10pm on Sunday 5 December 2021. The £598 million figure for national 
spending calculated using ONS estimation of the UK adult population based on self-reported shopper 
estimates of spend and does not reflect actual receipts or sales.

In May 2022, we issued our inaugural $1 billion ESG Bond, which we will use to finance new and existing Green and Social projects. 
This is our first-ever financing instrument dedicated to support our ESG strategy and will serve to advance our programs and 
promote ESG-related investments.

Enhancing Our ESG Governance 

In addition to progressing on our ESG goals, we have been focused on the governance and disclosures around our ESG strategy  
and programs. In 2022, we incorporated ESG risks, including climate-related risks, as an emerging risk for the Company within our 
Enterprise Risk Management framework. 

To help manage our climate-related risks, in 2021, we became a formal supporter of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) and assessed physical and transition risks to our business in alignment with the TCFD recommendations.

Conclusion

Over the last two years we have created more opportunities to collaborate and innovate across the enterprise and we have done a 
significant amount of work to define our ESG priorities and objectives. We also established measurable goals and action plans to 
achieve them as we continue to execute across each of our three ESG pillars. All of this work has accelerated our progress and put  
us on a clear path to strengthen our global impact in the coming years. 

Our work has only just begun. As we look ahead, we will continue to build on our momentum, putting our ESG strategy into action  
to back our colleagues, customers, and communities and make a positive impact in people’s lives and the world we live in.

for our company, stakeholders, and society: 
Promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
(DE&I); Advance Climate Solutions; and

ALIGNING OUR COMMUNITY GIVING 
PRIORITIES TO OUR ESG STRATEGY

In 2022, we announced new grant priorities that build on our legacy 
of community giving and directly support our ESG strategy roadmap 
launched in 2021. Going forward, the American Express Foundation 
will direct its resources to three core priorities: 

 Backing Equal Futures

Programs that provide skills and pathways to 
prepare youth (ages 13 to 30) for long-term 
success and the future of work, including the 
green economy, digital futures, and STEAM 
fields such as science, technology, engineering, 
the arts, and mathematics:

•  Programs may include school-based, college, 

trade school, public service, or workforce-
related training or mentoring to support  
skill building, education, the transition to 
meaningful employment, or self-sufficiency  
for underrepresented populations.

Advocacy to support education and  
workforce development in underrepresented 
communities:

•  Eligible organizations for underrepresented 

communities include those supporting  
racial, ethnic, and Indigenous minorities,  
women, refugees, incarcerated or formerly 
incarcerated, unhoused and formerly  
unhoused people, veterans or families  
of veterans, disadvantaged or people  
with disabilities, and members of the  
LGBTQ+ community.

 Backing Small

Support for underrepresented and economically 
vulnerable small business owners and 
entrepreneurs through our “Backing Small” 
initiative, including grants, mentoring support,  
and technical assistance through established 
community partnerships. Programs include:

•  Inclusive Backing

•  Coalition to Back Black Businesses

•  Backing Historic Small Restaurants

•  Backing International Small Restaurants

•  Blueprint: Backing BIPOC Businesses in Canada

•  First Nations Business Growth Program in Australia

Financial literacy education, training,  
and mentoring for underrepresented  
individuals and families to build financial 
awareness, fiscal acumen, and success,  
including for school age grades 5-12,  
during higher education, or when individuals  
are entering or re-entering the workforce.

 Backing Low-Carbon Communities
Advance climate innovation and solutions, particularly in 
urban areas, through:

•  Programs, partnerships, and action focused on energy 

transition, emissions reduction, and efficiency.

•  Community-led climate projects focused on nature-based  

or clean energy initiatives, including those led by 
underrepresented groups.

•  Disaster relief and resilience building programs and  

initiatives in extreme weather prone areas and cities where  
our colleagues and customers live and work to provide 
immediate and/or long-term relief to natural and man-made 
disasters and help create climate-resilient communities.

OUR INAUGURAL $1 BILLION ESG BOND

In May 2022, American Express completed its first-ever ESG bond offering, maturing in 2029.  
We intend that an amount equivalent to the net proceeds of the $1 billion ESG bond will be 
allocated toward new and/or existing eligible projects in the Green and Social categories, as 
directed by the newly developed American Express Sustainable Financing Framework, which  
is aligned with the company’s global ESG strategy.

Projects in the Green category include those related to green 
buildings, energy efficiency improvements and renewable 
energy, and the circular economy, such as expenditures

SUPPORTING HUMANITARIAN RELIEF EFFORTS IN UKRAINE 

In light of the attacks on the Ukrainian people, we have taken 
several actions to support our colleagues, customers, and the 
humanitarian relief efforts in the region. 

We also provided $1 million in aid to the following 
organizations that are providing assistance to impacted 
populations:

For example, we teamed up with Hilton to donate up to one 
million hotel room nights in hotels across Europe to support 
Ukrainian refugees and first responders who are helping them. 
We also enabled our US Consumer, Small Business, and 
Corporate Card Members who are enrolled in the Membership 
Rewards® program to use their Membership Rewards to 
support select charities that are providing humanitarian relief 
efforts in Ukraine and affected parts of Europe and matched 
the dollar value of their contributions made using points with 
PayPal Giving Fund through June 15, 2022. We are continuing  
to match colleague donations through the American Express 
Match program. 

•  $250,000 to the International Rescue Committee (IRC) 

to provide necessary resources where they are needed most, 
including to those who have fled their homes.

•  $250,000 to the International Medical Corps (IMC), 
which has deployed mobile medical teams to provide 
essential emergency and primary health services, mental 
health and psychosocial support services, and COVID-19 
awareness and prevention services to help keep affected 
populations safe from the pandemic.

•  $250,000 to the American Red Cross to support 

coordinated relief efforts by the International Federation of 
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and other Red Cross 
partners who are responding to urgent needs and providing 
technical assistance on the ground.

•  $250,000 toward UNICEF’s emergency appeal to support 
children and families as the crisis escalates with life-saving 
programs, safe water, emergency health, hygiene, education 
aid, and other immediate help for those in need of support.

BACKING OUR COMMUNITIES 
WITH $1 BILLION+ TOWARD 
CHARITABLE CAUSES

Since creating the American Express 
Foundation in 1954, we have provided more 
than $1 billion to charitable causes around 
the world through the Foundation and our 
Corporate Giving Program.

In 2021, we provided $38 million in 
charitable giving globally, including grants 
from our company, the American Express 
Foundation, our Center for Community 
Development, and gift-matching programs.

PROVIDING POWERFUL BACKING THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC 

We have provided support to our colleagues, customers, and 
communities over the last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic.  

For colleagues, this included:

•  Providing coverage of out-of-pocket medical and pharmacy 

costs related to COVID-19 testing and treatment for 
colleagues enrolled in our US medical plans.

•  Up to 16 hours of paid time off for obtaining COVID-19 

vaccines and boosters. 

•  Partnering with departments of health and hospitals in the  

US and India to host onsite vaccine clinics for our colleagues, 
families, and contractors.  

For customers:

• We continued to help merchant partners do business while 

keeping their own customers and staff safe.

• For businesses, we raised contactless transaction thresholds 
to reduce physical contact at points of sale and reminded 
merchants that we do not require them to collect Card 
Members’ signatures.

In the communities we serve:

• We provided more than $11 million in philanthropic support 
for COVID-19 relief efforts since the start of the pandemic 
through 2021, delivering financial support to nonprofits 
worldwide working on the front lines of the ongoing global 
crisis. One of these partners was (RED), which we’ve 
highlighted below. 

COVID-19 relief efforts

Community support during  
the COVID-19 pandemic  
has remained a priority. We 
provided more than $11 million 
in philanthropic support for 
COVID-19 relief efforts since 
the start of the pandemic 
through 2021. 

$11M+

CODE (RED): A POWERFUL PARTNERSHIP FOR PUBLIC HEALTH

In 2021, we joined forces with (RED) to support equitable 
access to testing, treatment, and vaccines in response to  
the impact of COVID-19 in the world’s poorest countries. 

To shine a spotlight on the campaign, we partnered with 
(RED) to launch CODE (RED) alongside the reopening of 
Broadway, with Lin-Manuel Miranda joining American Express 
at a special performance of the hit musical “Hamilton.” 

We provided Card Members with the option to use 
Membership Rewards points to make donations through 
PayPal’s Pay with Rewards feature to help provide COVID-19 
testing, treatment, and vaccines for people most in need.  
We also donated $250,000 to COVID-19 relief efforts 
championed by (RED) and its partners, Fund for the Global 
Fund, and COVAX, and matched employee contributions to 
the campaign.

AMEX FLEX: OUR NEW WAY OF WORKING

AMEX FLEX HAS THREE  
WORK DESIGNATIONS

In March 2022, we officially launched Amex Flex, our new way of working where colleagues can 
work in the office, at home, or can take a hybrid approach that combines both. Amex Flex is 
designed to leverage the best of both in-person and remote work and to enable colleagues to  
have greater flexibility in their personal and professional lives. 

Our colleagues remained productive during the pandemic, which 
required us to become even more agile in how we work, and our 
new Amex Flex model is designed to continue this trend while 
leveling the playing field for colleagues across jobs and locations.

In-person connections at the office will also continue to play  
an important role in American Express’ future. We believe that 
being together in person has benefits, including spontaneous 
connections and idea sharing, team bonding and camaraderie, 
workspaces designed for creativity and collaboration, and more 
opportunities for mentorship, in-person coaching, and networking.

To back our colleagues during this transition, we are:

•  Phasing-in Amex Flex and avoiding a “one-size-fits-all" 

approach

•  Surveying our colleagues to garner feedback 

•  Remaining flexible to meet the needs of our colleagues

•  Deploying our real estate, technology, and medical teams  
to help create a welcoming and safe office environment

•  Conducting informational and re-orientation sessions on 

topics such as the ongoing health resources we are offering 

•  Introducing new office technologies to enhance the 

workplace experience and make it easy to collaborate with 
colleagues, such as equipping conference and huddle rooms 
with high-definition videoconferencing technology

•  Adding new technology benefits that provide colleagues  
the opportunity to order company-issued hardware and 
software to support working from home, regardless of their 
work designation

ONSITE 

ONSITE COLLEAGUES WORK IN THE  
OFFICE 4-5 DAYS PER WEEK. THIS 
OPTION APPLIES TO LIMITED SELECT 
ROLES THAT CAN ONLY BE PERFORMED 
IN AN OFFICE, THOSE WHO CANNOT 
PERFORM THEIR ROLES REMOTELY,  
OR FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE  
IN THE OFFICE EVERY DAY.

HYBRID 

HYBRID COLLEAGUES WORK A MIX OF 
IN-OFFICE AND VIRTUAL DAYS, COMING 
INTO THE OFFICE ABOUT TWO DAYS 
PER WEEK ON AVERAGE. LEADERS AND 
COLLEAGUES MAY PLAN COMMON 
DAYS FOR IN-PERSON CONNECTION, 
COLLABORATION, AND EVENTS.

FULLY VIRTUAL 

VIRTUAL COLLEAGUES WORK  
EXCLUSIVELY OR FOR THE VAST  
MAJORITY OF DAYS FROM HOME.

Kicking off Amex Flex We have launched Amex Flex in 18 countries.3

Offering flexibility has always been a part  
of our culture. In fact, before the pandemic 
around 20% of our US workforce was virtual. 
Since we announced Amex Flex, the majority 
of our colleagues in the US have chosen hybrid 
schedules, opting to spend their time between 
in-office and virtual days, coming into the 
office about two days per week, while more 
than 40% have opted to be fully virtual, a 
percentage that has doubled over the last  
two years.

As part of Amex Flex, all colleagues, except  
for those who are required to work onsite, will 
have the opportunity to work up to 30 days per 
calendar year from a location other than their 
primary work location.

Our first office sites to adopt Amex Flex were in 
the UK and the US in the first quarter of 2022. 
Since then, offices in 18 countries in total have 
started Amex Flex.

Strategy Into Action: Exceeding $1 Billion of Spend Toward Our DE&I Action Plan, 
Announcing an Additional $3 Billion 

When we announced our $1 billion Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion (DE&I) Action Plan in October of 2020, we sought  
to build on our foundation of supporting diverse representation 
and equal opportunities for our colleagues, customers,  
and communities. That legacy includes a longstanding 
commitment to fostering an inclusive and welcoming  
workplace that reflects the diversity of our communities, 
promoting equal economic opportunity for our diverse 
customer base and business partners, and supporting 
community initiatives focused on advancing equality and  
social justice. 

As of March 2022, we exceeded $1 billion in spending  
since October 2020 toward our DE&I Action Plan, ahead  
of schedule. Our investments included spending with 
underrepresented-owned suppliers, expanding access to  
capital and financial education for underrepresented-owned 
small businesses, supporting partnerships with nonprofit 
organizations focused on promoting equality and social justice, 
and investments in pay equity.  

$4B toward DE&I

Building on our progress, we now plan to spend an additional $3 billion 
toward DE&I initiatives—for an ambition to spend $4 billion in total from 
late 2020 through the end of 2025.

The majority of additional spend will continue to be allocated to 
underrepresented-owned suppliers.

Global investments outside the United States may include initiatives  
like Blueprint: Backing BIPOC Businesses,™ a mentorship and grant 
program designed to support the advancement of Black, Indigenous,  
or People of Color (BIPOC) business owners in Canada. Launched last 
year, 100 Blueprint recipients own and operate small businesses in cities 
across Canada and represent a wide range of industries, including 
agriculture, consulting services, and technology solutions.

We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure colleagues in the same job, level  
and location are compensated fairly regardless of gender globally, and race and ethnicity in  
the United States. 

In 2021, for the second consecutive year, we achieved 100% pay “equity”—meaning no  
statistical differences in pay—across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in  
the US. Our pay equity achievement is supported by compensation policies, processes, and 
practices designed to pay colleagues in all roles and at all levels based on performance and  
other business-related criteria, making appropriate salary adjustments where needed.

As part of the evaluation of our pay practices and reward structure, we have conducted annual  
pay equity reviews with independent experts since 2017. Since 2019, this analysis has covered  
our entire global colleague population across genders globally and across races and ethnicities  
in the US, assessing pay on a statistical basis and considering key factors that influence 
compensation, including but not limited to tenure, role, level, geography, and performance.

In 2021, we began disclosing the “raw median pay gap” for women globally and for diverse 
colleagues in the United States. This metric compares differences in raw median base pay, with  
no adjustments for factors such as role, level, tenure, performance, or geography. In 2021, the 
median pay for women globally at American Express was 106.7% of the median pay for men. The 
median pay for racially/ethnically diverse colleagues in the US was 95.2% of that for white colleagues.7

We believe our pay equity review provides a more accurate and comprehensive picture of our 
compensation practices overall because it provides a more granular view that considers many 
important factors known to affect an individual’s compensation. For this reason, we use pay  
equity as the standard we hold ourselves accountable to. We remain committed to maintaining 
100% pay equity for colleagues across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the  
US by continuing our annual pay equity review process.

4.  As of year-end 2021; based on the U.S. EEO-1 job categories. Some percentages do not sum due to rounding.
5.  Race/ethnicity based on self-identified information. Less than 1% of new colleague hires did not disclose their race or ethnicity in 2021.

7.  US racially/ethnically diverse colleagues based on US EEO-1 categories including Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, Native American,  

or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and two or more races.

Belonging and inclusion at American Express

EXPANSIVE AND IMPACTFUL FAMILY SUPPORT

To support our efforts to create an inclusive and welcoming culture for our colleagues, we 
introduced two trainings in 2020: a “Strengthening Our Culture of Belonging and Inclusion”  
course and a “Belonging at Amex” workshop. We supplemented these trainings with conversations 
and informational sessions on how colleagues can contribute to a culture of inclusion. 

For US colleagues who use adoption, surrogacy, or egg/sperm donors, we offer 
reimbursement that covers expenses up to $35,000—for up to two events, with a lifetime 
maximum of $70,000. Those who undergo reproductive treatments are eligible for up to 
$35,000 in medical assistance.

Throughout, colleagues had access to numerous resources on leading inclusively, having 
meaningful conversations, and making their voices heard.

2021 Colleague Experience Survey

85%  of participants indicated that they feel valued as a colleague at American Express 
91% of participants responded that they feel supported by their leader in making 

decisions about their well-being

To further help colleagues feel a sense of belonging, we have 14 Colleague Networks, with  
over 100 chapters worldwide, for sharing common experiences and interests:

• Asian Network at American Express (ANA)

• Jewish Network (CHAI)

• Black Engagement Network (BEN)

• Muslim Network (PEACE)

• Christian Network (SALT)

• PRIDE+ Network

• Disability Awareness Network (DAN)

• Veterans Network (VET)

• Families at American Express Network

• Virtual Office Network

• Generations Network (NextGen)

• Women in Technology Network (WIT)

• Hispanic Origin & Latin American Network (HOLA)

• Women’s Interest Network (WIN)

In addition to our Colleague Networks, we have nine Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Councils 
across Business Units and in office locations to address local priorities.

“ We adopted our son and in fact, Amex has been there for us since day one and 
throughout every step of the way,” says Sean B., an analyst in our Global Risk  
and Compliance department. “The company’s family planning and assistance 
program provided us with the financial support to adopt earlier than what  
we thought was possible. Additionally, the family concierge benefit helped  
us throughout the adoption process and is a resource we continue to use when  
we need childcare.” 

“ The dependent care flexible spending account has also provided comfort 
financially,” Sean added, “which has especially been helpful during these current 
times when we’re doing the best we can in a lot of situations that are entirely new 
and the challenges we’ve had to navigate around due to COVID.”

This support continues after colleagues welcome their new family members. Under our 
gender-neutral parental leave policy, eligible colleagues in the United States can take up  
to 20 weeks parental leave with full base pay, whether they’re welcoming a child through 
pregnancy, adoption, or surrogacy. We also provide six to eight weeks of additional leave  
if medically necessary.

We also provide colleagues in Canada, the UK, and the US access to in-home or center-
based childcare when their regular arrangements fall through, as well as connection with 
24/7 consultants who can help arrange in-home care for an adult loved one recovering 
from an illness or injury.

Backing women colleagues

In 2021, women represented more than half of our workforce 
worldwide, and approximately four out of 10 senior executives 
were women. We are invested in engaging, retaining, and 
backing our women colleagues and helping them realize their 
professional potential through initiatives and programs that 
help them grow, develop, and thrive. For example, in India,  
we have established more than 20 small peer group “Lean  
In Circles” designed to build connection and new skills.  
Through customized training and partnerships with external 
organizations, we offer colleagues a variety of meaningful 
learning and development opportunities. 

In 2020, we launched the Ambition Project in partnership with 
The New York Women’s Foundation to encourage our women 
colleagues to fully embrace their ambition and support the 
ambitions of others. In 2022, we once again partnered with the 
New York Women’s Foundation for a global study on women’s 
relationship with ambition, both in their careers and personal 
lives—and their confidence in achieving success after a global 
pandemic. Amidst a rapidly changing workforce, women remain 
ambitious, and we continue to proudly back their aspirations.

In 2022, nearly 4,000 colleagues around the 
world joined our enterprise-wide International 
Women’s Day events live, featuring  
American Express leaders and external 
guests, in addition to 30 local events. For 
example, our Japan Women’s Network 
organized an event with a guest speaker on 
the topic of how to “Design Your Ambition.” 

Backing colleagues with disabilities 

We are committed to providing colleagues with an inclusive 
work environment, from accessibility tools on the job to 
benefits that support a healthy work-life balance.

In 2021, we enabled closed captioning as a standard for virtual 
livestream events to make broadcast content more accessible. 
We also launched enhanced accessibility features for online 
meetings, such as closed captioning, screen reader notifications, 
and the ability to change chat font size. These represent just a 
few of the resources and best practices we’ve made available  
to colleagues across the enterprise. 

To advance our disability inclusion initiatives, we’re now 
members of the Inclusion Works community as part of our 
Disability:IN partnership, in which we collaborate with  
disability inclusion experts to implement best practices in this 
space. We’ve continued our membership in the Valuable 500  
in the UK, which enlists companies to keep disability inclusion 
on the leadership agenda and make a commitment to action.

Within our company, our Disability Awareness Network (DAN) 
plays an important role in creating a sense of belonging and 
community among our colleagues with seen and unseen 
disabilities and raising awareness for disability inclusion. For 
International Day of Persons with Disabilities in December 2021, 
DAN brought together authors, advocates, entrepreneurs, 
mental health experts, and our colleagues from India, Spain, 
the UK, and beyond under the common theme of “Recognize 
More: Proudly Backing Disability Inclusion.” This virtual event 
was an opportunity to drive inclusion of people with disabilities 
by demonstrating support and helping educate allies on how 
best to partner with their colleagues with disabilities.

Backing Black and African American colleagues

A culture of belonging gains strength when colleagues 
worldwide have opportunities to make their voices heard, 
listen, learn, and build their skills for inclusive leadership. 
Heritage months and cultural moments provided valuable 
occasions to spark these conversations and connections.  
For instance, Black Engagement Network (BEN) chapters 
across Canada and the United States celebrated Black  
History Month with a variety of events, open to all colleagues, 
under the theme of “Say It Loud.” BEN, in partnership with  
its executive committee sponsors, also promoted networking 
and development for vice presidents and above. Executive  
BEN held its sixth Global Forum in June 2021. The forum 
brought together 72 Black leaders from across the company, 
our CEO and Executive Committee members, and host  
Anré Williams, CEO, American Express National Bank and 
Group President of Enterprise Services. Attendees gained 
exposure to new perspectives, networked, honed their 
leadership skills, and helped shape plans for driving change  
for our Black colleagues.  

In 2022, we made Juneteenth, also known as Black 
Independence Day, a company holiday in the US, giving 
colleagues the day to learn, celebrate, and reflect. Juneteenth  
is a reminder of both the progress that has been made and  
the work still left to be done to ensure all people have equal 
opportunities to achieve dignity, happiness, and success.

Backing Hispanic and Latinx colleagues

During Hispanic and Latinx Heritage Month, our Hispanic Origin 
and Latin American Colleague Network (HOLA), hosted global 
events focused on “Amplifying the Impact: Proudly Backing 
Hispanic and Latinx Achievement.”

Our theme showcased our commitment to celebrating our 
Hispanic and Latinx colleagues—appreciating who they are, 
acknowledging the strength they bring to our organization,  
and amplifying the lasting impact of their accomplishments. 

Backing Asian, Asian American, and Pacific 
Islander colleagues

During Asian Pacific American Heritage Month in 2022,  
we celebrated the rich cultural diversity of our colleagues  
with the theme “Make Culture Shine: Proudly Backing All  
Asian Communities.” We also hosted a conversation titled 
“American Express Voices” with some of our Asian Network 
Amex leaders about bringing their whole selves to work and 
telling their stories. 

Names are often tied to heritage and culture, and we took the 
opportunity during Asian Pacific American Heritage Month in 
2021 to introduce a new pronunciation feature in our company 
Slack channel where colleagues can list the phonetic spelling  
of their names. We also published an internal colleague feature 
titled “What’s in a Name?” and encouraged colleagues to ask 
and learn about each other’s names so we can all get to know 
each other on a deeper level.

As principal partner, we will work alongside the Sydney Gay  
and Lesbian Mardi Gras and Sydney WorldPride teams to 
coordinate a festival of events across Greater Sydney that 
celebrate our diverse LGBTQ+ communities, which include the 
iconic Mardi Gras Fair Day. These partnerships build upon our 
support of LGBTQ+ communities, including our membership 
with Open for Business—a coalition of companies making  
the economic and business case for LGBTQ+ inclusion in 
companies around the world. We also received Silver status  
in the 2022 Australian Workplace Equality Index (AWEI).

Backing our service members and veterans

The Amex Veterans Network (VET) was launched in 2012  
and supports our colleagues who are currently serving in the 
military, are veterans, have friends or family in the military, or 
just want to show their support for our troops.

In 2021, American Express, in partnership with VET, provided a 
$50,000 grant to American Corporate Partners (ACP), a national 
nonprofit organization focused on helping returning veterans 
and active-duty spouses find their next careers through one-
on-one mentoring, networking, and online career advice.

corporate policies, practices, 

and benefits pertinent to LGBTQ+ colleagues. Each 
year since 2004, American Express has scored 100% 
on this index. Additionally, in 2022, we were named to 
their list of Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality.

Backing LGBTQ+ inclusion

In 2021, our PRIDE+ Colleague Network developed a powerful 
theme in honor of Pride Month to continue driving a message  
of inclusion to our colleagues around the globe “Live Beyond 
Labels: Proudly Backing All of You” and engaged colleagues in 
enterprise-wide conversations.

In October 2021, we announced that we commenced an 
exclusive three-year principal partnership with the Sydney Gay 
and Lesbian Mardi Gras and that we will partner with Sydney 
WorldPride in 2023.

BACKING OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS

American Express seeks to meet the needs of under represented businesses and consumers  
and develop more inclusive marketing initiatives. We are also focused on our efforts to help 
underrepresented-owned businesses through our supplier diversity program.

Raising the bar for supply chain diversity   

Successful strategies and innovative products and services 
require diverse perspectives and contributions. For these 
reasons, American Express has a goal to increase spending with 
underrepresented-owned suppliers who provide us with 
professional services, marketing, and beyond.

To build a more diverse, inclusive supply chain, we consider at 
least one diverse vendor for each request for proposal. We track 
and measure our annual spend with certified business enterprises 
run by underrepresented owners and operators, including:

• Minority-owned Business Enterprises (MBE)

• Black-owned Businesses

• Women-owned Business Enterprises (WBE)

• LGBT-owned Business Enterprises (LGBTE)

• Veteran’s Business Enterprises (VBE)

• Service-Disabled Veteran’s Business Enterprises (SDVBE)

• Disability-owned Business Enterprises (DOBE)

• Small Business Enterprises/8(a)/HUBZone firms 

In 2021, we introduced more than 65 new underrepresented-
owned suppliers to grow our program and in 2022 started 
working with select suppliers to begin tracking diverse  
supplier spend within their own supply chains. 

Our supplier diversity partners include:

• Disability: IN

• Financial Services Roundtable for Supplier Diversity (FSRSD)

• Minority Supplier Development UK (MSDUK)

• National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC)

• National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC)

• National Veterans Business Development Council (NVBDC)

• Supply Nation

• US Black Chambers

• WEConnect International

In October 2020, we announced a goal to double our 
annual spend with underrepresented-owned suppliers  
in the United States from a 2019 baseline to $750 million 
by the end of 2024, including increasing spend with  
Black-owned suppliers to at least $100 million annually.  
In 2021, we not only made progress toward this goal, but 
also exceeded our initial expectations for the year, as 
shown in the graphic below.

Backing our customers with purpose-driven 
travel options

In 2021, we provided $20 million to Accion Opportunity Fund,  
a nonprofit Community Development Financial Institution  
and small business lender, to expand access to loans for 
historically underfunded small businesses in the United 
States, including those owned by underrepresented groups.

Learn more about our investments in the communities we serve in 
Backing Our Communities in the Building Financial Confidence section.

Joining forces for more inclusive travel 

In March 2022, we proudly announced our global platinum-
level sponsorship of the International LGBTQ+ Travel 
Association (IGLTA), a global leader in advancing LGBTQ+ 
travel and have signed a multi-year agreement to join IGLTA. 
IGLTA provides information and resources for LGBTQ+ 
travelers and expands LGBTQ+ tourism globally by 
demonstrating its significant social and economic impact.  
This partnership supports diversity, equity, and inclusion in  
the travel industry by enriching our Card Members’ journeys 
through inclusive travel choices and practices.

Our customers are traveling with more purpose and seeking  
to have a positive impact on the places they visit. According  
to our Global Travel Trends report, 81% of respondents  
reported that they want to travel to destinations where  
they can immerse themselves in the local culture and 81%  
of respondents want the money they spend while traveling  
to go back to the local community.8 

To help our customers navigate purpose-driven travel options 
and experience destinations in a more meaningful way, 
American Express Travel is partnering with Kensington Tours  
to launch bespoke itineraries in countries around the world 
geared toward cultural exchange and supporting the local 
economies. Our initial launch features customizable tours for 
Denmark, Kenya, Peru, South Africa, and Vietnam available  
for US Platinum Card Members to book exclusively through 
American Express Travel.

By leveraging existing partnerships and cultivating new ones, 
American Express Travel is identifying new thoughtful travel 
options that align with what our customers value.

8.  Methodology: Amex Trendex online poll was conducted by Morning Consult between February 3–11, 2022, among a national sample of 2,000 travelers in the US and 1,000 travelers in Japan, Australia, Mexico, India, UK, and 
Canada who have a household income of at least $70K and defined as adults who typically travel by air at least once a year. Results from each country survey have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Connecting underrepresented-owned 
businesses to capital and support  

As part of our ESG strategy to Promote Diversity, Equity,  
and Inclusion, we have a goal to provide at least 250,000 
underrepresented-owned small- and medium-sized US 
businesses access to capital and financial education from late 
2020 through 2024. We’re progressing toward this goal by 
delivering educational resources, expanded access to credit 
and loans, grants, marketing support, and more.

For nine years, we’ve partnered with Women Impacting  
Public Policy and the US Small Business Administration to  
help boost the prospects of women entrepreneurs to gain 
government contracts. Our ChallengeHER program offers free 
training webinars, workshops, mentoring, and direct access  
to government buyers and local partner resources. From  
2013 through the end of 2021, this initiative has hosted 170 

webinars and facilitated over 4,800 meetings between  
women-owned small businesses and government officials.  
In 2021, there were more than 2,300 total attendees for 
ChallengeHER webinars.

We also hosted Contract Connections for the ninth year at the 
2021 Business Class LIVE virtual event for small business 
owners, connecting many underrepresented-owned small 
business suppliers with large corporate and government  
buyers in one-on-one sessions. We continued to offer small 
business owners’ access to Business Class, a platform offering 
customized business education resources. We also maintained 
our support of Minority- and Women-Owned Business 
Enterprises (MWBEs) as part of our capital markets funding  
and share repurchase programs. In 2021, we engaged four 
MWBEs for underwriting and share repurchases, and through 
May of 2022, we engaged six such MWBEs.

BACKING OUR COMMUNITIES

Advancing racial equality and social justice in our communities starts with our business ethics and 
extends through our partnerships, grants, and community investments worldwide. 

Investing in organizations that are addressing 
inequality and promoting social justice

To support DE&I efforts in the communities where we live  
and work, we have a goal to provide $50 million in grants from 
late 2020 through 2024 to nonprofits focused on addressing 
inequality and promoting social justice, including those led  
by members of underrepresented groups. Since late 2020, 
we’ve provided more than $14 million in grants so far to these 
organizations.  

Some examples of the initiatives we supported in  
2020–2021 include:  

• Social purpose leadership training for diversity  

organizations, including Hispanics in Philanthropy, Public 
Allies, the Council of Urban Professionals Institute,  
Americans for Indian Opportunity, National Urban League, 
and Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics (LEAP)

• Leadership programs that support women leaders in the 
nonprofit sector, including with The New York Women’s 
Foundation

• The New York City LGBTQ+ Historic Sites Project, run by the 

Fund for the City of New York

• Development programs supporting visually impaired leaders 

with the American Foundation for the Blind

• Initiatives with the First Nations Development Institute 

addressing the immediate and economic needs of Native 
American communities disproportionately impacted by 
COVID-19 and food insecurity

Backing equal futures 

We support organizations that are reducing economic, health, 
educational, and racial disparities through our new Backing 
Equal Futures grantmaking pillar. In 2021, this support 
included grants to the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational 
Fund, The Hispanic Scholarship Fund, and NAF (formerly the 
National Academy Foundation). In addition, we’ve also 
established strategic partnerships with organizations such as 
United Negro College Fund (UNCF), the Thurgood Marshall 
Fund, and HBCU Connect to provide career readiness 
programming and access to internships and full-time career 
opportunities to Historically Black College and University 
(HBCU) students and alumni.

BACKING LGBTQ+ YOUTH  
IN OUR COMMUNITY

American Express has supported 
the Trevor Project since 2019.  
As the world’s largest suicide 
prevention and mental health 
organization for LGBTQ+ young 
people, the Trevor Project works  
to save young lives by providing support through free 
and confidential suicide prevention and mental health 
programs. The organization also runs TrevorSpace,  
the world’s largest safe space social networking site  
for LGBTQ+ youth, and operates innovative education, 
research, and advocacy programs.

Our grant funding of $250,000 is supporting the  
Trevor Project’s international expansion of crisis 
services to Mexico and an LGBTQ+ advocacy strategy 
in the United States. Through this strategy, the Trevor 
Project aims to meet vulnerable LGBTQ+ youth with 
life-saving support across multiple fronts.

Cultivating a more diverse generation  
of future leaders

American Express has invested approximately $100 million 
since 2007 to help more than 165,000 social purpose 
leaders reach their potential. The American Express 
Leadership Academy builds the personal, business, and 
leadership skills of emerging nonprofit and social purpose 
leaders through multi-day trainings. In 2021, we continued 
to support our partners and participants by hosting 11 
virtual programs for over 500 leaders from 11 countries. We 
also pledged to increase the representation of individuals 

from underrepresented groups among US participants from 
50% in 2019 to 75% by 2024. We have already exceeded our 
goal, achieving 76% participation by individuals from 
underrepresented groups in 2021.

In 2021, we joined with NinetyToZero, an initiative focused on 
combating the 90% racial wealth gap between white and 
Black Americans, which is expected to complement and build 
upon our 2020 partnership with OneTen, an organization 
whose mission is to hire, promote, and advance one million 
Black individuals who do not have a four-year degree into 
family-sustaining careers over the span of 10 years.

We also participate in the Business Roundtable’s Multiple 
Pathways Initiative (MPI), which seeks to reform companies’ 
hiring and talent management practices to emphasize the 
value of skills, rather than just degrees, and to improve 
equity, diversity, and workplace culture. 

American Express has 
invested approximately  
$100 million since 2007  
to help more than 165,000 
social purpose leaders  
reach their potential.

Supporting vital community services for 
underrepresented groups in Australia

American Express backs communities through local action  
on a global scale. For example, as the pandemic impacted 
education worldwide, many children, especially from under-
represented groups, faced the risk of being left behind.  
We helped address this situation for Australia’s Aboriginal  
and Torres Strait Islander communities by supporting the 
Australian Literacy and Numeracy Foundation to continue 
delivering its Early Language & Literacy Program through  
digital innovations, enabling over 1,500 children to date to  
make critical progress in their oral language and early literacy 
development. The program is one of the many ways we back 
this community and demonstrates our commitment to 
reconciliation as part of our Reconciliation Action Plan.

RECOGNITION FOR OUR COMMITMENT TO HISPANIC AND LATINX COMMUNITIES  

“ I’m proud that we put our service ethic  
to work to empower local leaders and 
organizations, like the Hispanic  
Federation, that are tackling some of 
society’s toughest challenges. Making  
a positive difference in the lives of our 
customers, business partners, and  
our communities, is something we take  
very seriously. It’s what drives us.”

MINIMIZING OUR CLIMATE IMPACT 

We believe we have a role to play in supporting the transition to  
a low-carbon economy and have been working toward advancing 
climate solutions on multiple fronts:
•  Managing our 
•  Minimizing the 

•  Developing new 

climate impact of 
our operations

climate-related risks 
and opportunities

capabilities for our 
customers and partners

•  Supporting community programs and 
initiatives to help build more climate-
resilient and equitable communities

Advancing climate solutions starts with our own operations. 
Since 2018, we have been a CarbonNeutral® company, powered 
by 100% renewable electricity across our global operations.5  
To build on these efforts, in 2021 we committed to net-zero 
emissions by 2035 in alignment with the Science Based  
Targets initiative (SBTi). We are also working to enhance the 
management of our climate-related risks and opportunities 
across our business and became a formal supporter of the  
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

In 2020 and 2021, we conducted a qualitative climate risk 
scenario analysis to assess physical and transition risks to our 
business related to climate change in alignment with the TCFD. 
We assessed transition risks associated with current and 

emerging regulations, technology advances, and market and 
reputational impacts and identified opportunities, including 
developing new low-carbon products and services for 
customers. Additionally, ESG risks–in particular climate 
risk–have been included as an emerging risk for the 
company, and are part of our Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) framework. Climate-related risks are currently 
managed as part of our ERM process. The Risk Committee  
of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our ERM 
framework, processes, and methodologies, and approves  
our ERM policy, which governs risk governance, risk oversight, 
and risk appetite.

We have also continued to leverage programs like 
Green2Gether to engage our colleagues in sustainability 
initiatives.

For our customers and partners, we set a goal to pilot new 
low-carbon product innovations by the end of 2022. We’ve 
made progress toward this goal, including piloting carbon 
tracking solutions for corporate clients, launching new 
recycled plastic cards in Canada and France, and partnering 
with Delta Air Lines on cards made from 70% reclaimed 
plastic that received a certification as a CarbonNeutral® 
product in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol. 

To support more climate-resilient and equitable communities, 
we launched a goal to provide at least $10 million from  
2021 through 2025 to support initiatives, partnerships, and 
programs that address the adverse effects of climate change 
and pollution on communities.   

Read on to learn how we’ve progressed, and what we still 
aim to do, in order to: 

•  Minimize our climate impact 

• Manage our climate-related risks and opportunities

• Develop new capabilities to enable our customers and 

partners to transition to a low-carbon economy

• Support community programs and initiatives to help  

build more climate-resilient and equitable communities

JOINING FORCES FOR  
LOW-CARBON COMMUNITIES 

Advancing climate solutions globally requires a 
collaborative approach, so in April and May 2022,  
we announced new partnerships with nonprofits. 
Through grants to American Forests, C40 Cities, 
National Park Foundation, and Earthwatch Institute,  
we plan to fund projects and initiatives to support 
nature-based solutions and sustainability efforts  
in local communities, particularly in urban areas. 
Partnering with these organizations is another 
important step in our objective to advance  
climate solutions. 

In May 2022, we closed  
our first-ever ESG bond 
issuance. We intend that an 
amount equivalent to the  
net proceeds of the $1 billion 
ESG bond will be allocated 
toward projects in the  
Green and Social categories, 
including investments in 
green buildings and 
initiatives supporting a 
circular economy.

MOVING TO NET-ZERO 

We support the shift toward a low-carbon economy, in line with the science-based 
recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 

2025 operational environmental goals

In 2019, we set operational environmental goals for 2025  
that cover energy and water use, waste generation, green 
building certifications, the phaseout of single-use plastics, and 
responsible paper sourcing; in 2021, we made progress on these 
goals. However, our reductions in energy, waste, and water were 
also greatly impacted by office closures due to the pandemic 
and we expect usage to increase as colleagues return to the 
office. While progress toward our operational environmental 
goals will not be linear, we expect to continue to make important 
advances to meet them over the next few years.

In 2021, we maintained CarbonNeutral® certification across  
our global operations, including offices, field sites, and data 
centers, in accordance with the CarbonNeutral Protocol,  
a leading third-party framework, and our operations remained 
powered by 100% renewable electricity.6 Following on these 
steps, we have committed to net-zero emissions by 2035 in 
alignment with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).7 

We made this commitment based on the SBTi’s most 
ambitious level of climate action, to limit global warming to  
1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In signing on  
to the Business Ambition for 1.5°C and the UN Race to Zero 
Campaign, American Express is among a growing roster of 
more than 1,400 companies setting targets to the 1.5°C goal. 

Since our operations are already carbon neutral, we will focus 
on our supply chain and work with our vendors, encouraging 
them to establish their own science-based emissions 
reduction targets and track, reduce, and eventually neutralize 
their operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 

6.  Operations include all our managed facilities, field sites, and data centers. Managed facilities are individual properties operationally managed by our global real estate team and housing critical business functions.  

Field sites are individual properties that are not operationally managed by our global real estate team but directly by our business units. They are typically smaller sites, less than 30,000 square feet (including airport 
lounges, foreign exchange kiosks, and sales offices), that are owned or leased by American Express. The company’s goal to remain carbon neutral covers Scope 1 (direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by 
American Express), Scope 2 (indirect location-based and market-based emissions), Scope 3 emissions (Category 5 waste generated in operations and Category 6 business travel) through renewable energy credits, 
carbon offsets, and reduced GHG emissions.

7.   American Express is following the methodology of the SBTi for our commitment to net-zero by 2035, which covers all Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a minimum of two-thirds of total Scope 3 emissions in conformance  

with the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.

$150M+

In 2019, we set a goal to have 60% of  
the total square footage of leased or  
owned facilities actively occupied by 
American Express be green building 
certified by 2025. Since the beginning  
of 2019, we have spent more than  
$150 million on the development of 
facilities that have received green  
building certifications.

Making progress in energy efficiency and  
Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions

In 2021, we continued to implement energy efficiency initiatives  
including lighting retrofits, HVAC equipment upgrades, and new  
building control systems, which are expected to save approximately 
1,500 MWh of energy use per year. Due to these measures and the 
reduction in energy demand due to temporary work-from-home 
arrangements, energy consumption in the facilities we manage in 2021 
decreased by approximately 57% compared to our 2011 baseline. 

We use several measures in addition to energy efficiency measures to 
help mitigate GHG emissions from our global operations, including  
onsite solar electricity generation, energy attribute certificates (EACs), 
and carbon offsets. 

Since 2018, we have powered our global operations with 100% 
renewable electricity. In 2021, we produced approximately 561 MWh  
of renewable solar electricity at our North Carolina data center and 
Brighton, UK office and we purchased 202,170 MWh of EACs. EACs  
verify the production of renewable electricity in an amount equivalent  
to the total electricity consumption and we purchase in alignment  
with the technical guidance from RE100, a global coalition of leading 
businesses committed to using 100% renewable electricity. 

We also purchased 22,770 MTCO2e of carbon offsets in 2021, including 
wind power development, reforestation, and forest conservation  
projects. These projects offset our emissions from activities such as  
fuel consumption, as well as Scope 3 emissions from colleague business 

travel, and the waste generated in our operations.

energy, water, and waste, please see the Environmental Performance 
Data Summary and Limited Assurance Statement of GHG Emissions

RENEWABLE ENERGY AND INCREASING ENERGY EFFICIENCY AT OUR DATA CENTERS 

Optimizing our workspaces 

Data centers are critical to the smooth operation of our 
business. They also represent approximately 850,000 
square feet of our building space and in 2021 used 
approximately 114,826 MWh—around 55% of the 
electricity that powers our operations. Our data centers 
produce 40% of our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon 
emissions. 

Solar panels on our North Carolina data center generated 
approximately 546 MWh of solar electricity in 2021, and 
energy efficiency measures across all our data centers 
have saved an estimated 3,600 MTCO2e in 2021. Our data 
centers report a power usage effectiveness (PUE)13 of 1.62 
for our production data center,14 1.59 for our redundancy 
data center,15 and 1.72 for our testing data center.

At our data center in Gurgaon, India, we implemented 
several energy efficiency and sustainability measures in 
2021, including installing high-performance thermal 
insulation that meets India’s Energy Conservation 
Building Code (ECBC) standards and reduces external 
heat gain, and equipping the UPS (Uninterruptable Power 
Supply) system with high-efficiency modular units. 

LEED New Construction Gold Certified data center in North Carolina

The rooftop solar at our North Carolina data center

As we work to reduce our energy use, maintain carbon 
neutrality, and find ways to reduce the environmental impact 
of our real estate footprint, we strive to design, build, and 
operate facilities that consume less resources, emit fewer 
greenhouse gases, and improve the quality of the indoor 
environment for our colleagues’ well-being. 

We seek to follow sustainability best practices, including  
the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED) certification program and other 
international green building standards including BREEAM, 
NABERS, GreenMark, HQE, and Effinergie+. 

In 2021, 25 of our facilities in 14 countries, representing 
approximately 56% of our global real estate portfolio, have 
achieved green building certifications, progress that puts  
us closer to meeting our goal of achieving green building 
certifications for 60% of our operations in 2025.16

We work to improve the sustainability and comfort of our  
office with ergonomic furniture and sustainable construction 
materials based on LEED standards. We also allocate workspace 
and remote work capabilities in ways designed to offer our 
colleagues flexibility and to use our real estate efficiently.  

Balancing sustainability and safety during  
the COVID-19 pandemic 

Engaging, educating, and making improvements 
to decrease water use 

As detailed earlier in this section, we made substantial 
progress against our operational environmental goals for 
2025. However, our reductions in energy, waste, and water 
across our global operations continued to be impacted  
by office closures due to COVID-19, health and safety best 
practices during the pandemic, and adoption of more  
flexible work arrangements for our colleagues. Because  
these changes impacted performance on our operational 
environmental goals against our 2019 pre-pandemic baseline, 
we have temporarily suspended reporting our performance

2021. Following best practices to support colleague health and 
safety during the pandemic, we removed reusable items from 
our cafeterias. In 2020 and 2021, to ensure we followed best 
practices to support health and safety during the pandemic  
and as a result of COVID-19-related building closures, we 
temporarily suspended tracking performance against our  
single-use plastic goal across our operations. 

As colleagues return to the office and water usage, energy 
usage, and waste generation increase, we will examine data  
and building attendance to give us more accurate insights  
into our performance against pre-pandemic baselines.

In 2019, we set a goal to reduce water consumption at our 
managed facilities by 10% per colleague by 2025. We are 
working toward this goal through colleague engagement and 
education and building design, such as low-flow fixtures and 
automatic water faucets in our newly-opened office building  
in Phoenix.

In 2021, we consumed 166,171 cubic meters across our global 
operations, 72% lower than 2019 and substantially impacted  
by office closures and work-from-home arrangements due to 
the pandemic. 

Sharpening our focus on waste reduction  
and management 

Four of our 2025 operational environmental goals are designed 
to reduce and divert landfill-bound waste and to phase out 
single-use plastics. We launched several initiatives in 2019 to 
support these goals, including a composting program at our 
New York headquarters. We have had to adapt some of these 
activities to meet COVID-19-related safety protocols, including 
the reintroduction of single-use paper cups in our floor  
pantries, although we have nevertheless seen a reduction in 
total waste generation, due in large part to office closures and 
work-from-home arrangements. In 2021, we diverted 54% from 
landfills compared to 52% in 2020.

Maintaining resiliency and business continuity  

To maintain resiliency and business continuity in our offices  
and data centers we factor climate-related physical risks into 
our short-, medium-, and long-term real estate strategies.  
One of our newer buildings in Sunrise, Florida, for example,  
is designed to withstand Category 5 hurricanes and major 
flooding events. In addition, we evaluate qualitative climate-
related transition risks that may impact our global operations, 
including current and emerging regulations. These climate-
related risks influence our operational strategy and we have 
identified opportunities to minimize these risks, including  
by maintaining carbon neutrality and continuing to invest in 
energy efficiency projects and renewable electricity.

Operating an environmentally and socially  
responsible supply chain 

In 2021, we sourced 96% of our direct marketing, customer 
communications, and office paper from certified responsibly 
managed forests, working toward a goal of 100% in 2025.

ALIGNING CLIMATE EFFORTS  
TO GLOBAL BEST PRACTICES  

We aim to align our efforts with global best 
practices among the numerous standards and 
frameworks that have emerged for measuring 
climate impact and action and promoting 
accountability for businesses. 

In addition to our commitment to net-zero 
emissions by 2035 in alignment with the Science 
Based Targets initiative, we joined the Business 
Ambition for 1.5°C and Race to Zero, established  
by the UN to rally leadership for a zero-carbon 
recovery. We are also a member of RE100, a global 
initiative of large businesses committed to using 
100% renewable electricity.

Further, we became a formal supporter of the  
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD), whose recommendations inform how we 
assess physical and transition risks and opportunities 
for our business.

BACKING OUR COLLEAGUES

Engaging our colleagues through Green2Gether 

Engaging our colleagues in sustainability initiatives through  
the Green2Gether program is an important goal of our ESG 
strategy, and we engage thousands of our colleagues during 
the year, offering workplace climate education, waste and 
energy reduction efforts, and volunteer opportunities with 
non-profit partners. 

Volunteer-led Green2Gether activities range from beach 
cleanups to recycling drives to innovative virtual Earth Day 
campaigns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Every April during 
Earth Month, colleagues around the world can participate in 
dozens of company-sponsored activities, such as recycling 

drives, online lectures, community clean-ups, and sustainability 
awareness campaigns.

In 2021, we engaged colleagues virtually to support the 
planting of 100,000 trees in partnership with The Nature 
Conservancy’s Plant a Billion Trees campaign, funding 
approximately 210,000 trees in total since 2017. In 2022, 
colleagues have engaged in environmentally-focused  
in-person and/or virtual volunteer activities and events with 
The Central Park Conservancy, United Way of Salt Lake City, 
South Downs National Park (UK), PRIDE+ Network, Compass 
Group, Catchafire, and others.

CONNECTING OUR COLLEAGUES  
TO CLIMATE SOLUTIONS AND THE 
GREAT OUTDOORS 

The National Park Foundation’s Service Corps 
programs support essential preservation projects  
in national parks across the US. Through a new multi-
year partnership, we’re providing a total of $1 million 
in funding over the next three years to support the 
Service Corps program, building on over $5.7 million 
in funding to the National Park Foundation since 2015.   

In partnership with the Ocean Conservancy and 
International Coastal Cleanup, American Express 
colleagues collected approximately 24,000 pounds of 
marine debris globally from 2018 to 2022. Colleagues 
participated in beach cleanups and other initiatives 
across seven countries, including Australia, Italy, 
Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Spain, and the US.

BRANCHING OUT OUR 
SUSTAINABILITY ACTIVITIES IN 
MEXICO AND LATIN AMERICA

We have partnered with Reforestamos México, A.C. 
since 2016 on volunteering efforts to support 
conservation efforts across Mexico. Most recently,  
we have assisted Reforestamos in its actions to 
conserve more than 200 hectares of forests across  
five communities. From 2019 to 2021, colleagues 
participated in reforestation efforts including planting 
4,000 native trees and performing maintenance  
on fire breaks in the Nevado de Toluca Protected 
Natural Area. 

We also supported efforts to scale nature-based 
climate solutions. In 2021, we provided funding to the 
Latin American Seminar on Forest Entrepreneurship 
and Investment. The virtual event brought together 
800 forestry entrepreneurs, investors, and attendees 
from government and academia from 16 countries in 
Latin America to identify nature-based solutions to 
address climate change.

Colleagues also engage in supporting our Advance Climate Solutions goals by developing and 
implementing innovative programs, including Shop with Purpose initiative during Earth Month 2022.  

Helping Card Members “Shop with Purpose” During Earth Month

Each year, American Express hosts a number of innovation 
challenges which give colleagues around the world the 
opportunity to pitch new ideas. New York-based colleagues, 
Christina Glynn, Director of Business Development—Future  
of Membership, Amex Digital Labs and Paul Collins, Director  
of Strategy and Business Planning, Global Commercial 
Services saw their idea to help customers shop at  
conscious-minded companies become a reality this year.  
Glynn and Collins believed there was an opportunity  
to support our sustainability efforts by highlighting  
merchants who share our values and bringing new offers  
to our Card Members.

To help customers “Shop with Purpose,” Glynn and Collins 
developed and launched a curated collection of offers from 
Certified B Corp™ companies like Avocado Green Mattress, 
Stumptown Coffee Roasters and Vestiaire Collective, and  
other brands committed to making a difference. Featured 
throughout Earth Month in 2022, eligible US Consumer and 
Small Business Card Members were able to earn rewards  
for spend on eligible purchases with these merchants.

BACKING OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS

As climate action increases in importance for our customers and partners, we’re exploring new 
ways to deliver responsible products and services, help our customers make informed decisions, 
and promote responsible travel and conscientious consumption. To reinforce this, in 2021, we set 
a goal to pilot low-carbon product innovations by the end of 2022. 

According to the latest Amex Trendex,  
a trend report from American Express,  
76% of consumers surveyed feel a 
greater urgency to address climate 
change than they did a year ago, and 
84% of consumers surveyed agree they 
would like to better understand their 
carbon footprint.17

76%

Innovating low-carbon products and services 

Our customers and partners want to understand their 
environmental impact, reduce their carbon footprint, and play  
a part in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Across the 
company, we’re enhancing our capabilities to support them. 

For our corporate clients, we offer tools such as our Carbon 
Offset Referral Suite. The suite launched in June 2022 and 
provides US corporate customers with a curated list of carbon 
offset providers who can help them manage their footprint via 
offset solutions that include investments in large-scale carbon 
removal and reduction projects and avoidance projects.

This year, we’re developing new offerings as we work toward 
our goal to pilot low-carbon product innovations by the  
end of 2022. With our Shop with Purpose program, which  
won our enterprise-wide Innovation Challenge in 2020,  
we provided customers with special promotions through  
Amex Offers with select Certified B Corp™ companies  
and other brands committed to making a difference during 
Earth Month in 2022.

We currently make our  
Carbon Footprint Dashboard  
available to certain commercial  
clients to help track estimated  
carbon emissions associated with  
their employees’ air travel. We are now 
expanding this tool to include additional 
categories of spend—including ground 
transportation, hotel stays, restaurants,  
and retail—helping corporate clients  
better understand their carbon footprint  
so they can find opportunities to manage 
carbon emissions.18

17.  Methodology: This Amex Trendex online poll was conducted by Morning Consult between February 3-11th, 2022 among a national sample of 2,000 US and 1,000 travelers in Japan, Australia, Mexico, India, UK, and Canada 

who have a household income of at least $70K and defined as adults who typically travel by air at least once a year. Results from each market’s survey have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

18.  American Express’ Carbon Footprint Tool calculations are derived by applying selected conversion 

factors to spending made with the following American Express Corporate products: Corporate Card, 
Business Travel Account, Corporate Meeting Card, Corporate Purchasing Card, Buyer Initiated 
Payments, vPayments and Amex Go. The estimated information provided by the Carbon Footprint Tool

Promoting a circular economy and expanding recycled plastic cards 

To reduce the company’s consumption of virgin plastic, in 2019, 
we launched the first American Express Card manufactured 
primarily from reclaimed plastic collected from beaches and 
coastal communities. Since then, we have set a goal for the 
vast majority of plastic cards issued by American Express be 
made from at least 70% recycled or reclaimed plastic by the 
end of 2024. By achieving this goal, we can help avoid nearly 
160,000 pounds of virgin plastic from being used annually. 

To support this goal, we have already begun expanding our 
offerings to integrate recycled plastic into our card materials.  
In summer 2021, we launched our first card made from  
recycled PVC in Canada. In 2022, we announced that France  
will become the first market to shift to recycled plastic for 
almost all of our plastic cards.

More than 1.3 million 
cards recycled since 
2019, including cards 
returned by Card 
Members through  
our Card Take Back 
Program in the US

1.3M+

Additionally, as an example of collaboration with our strategic 
partners to collectively support our sustainability goals,  
we partnered with Delta Air Lines on the Delta SkyMiles 
American Express Cards made from 70% reclaimed plastic 
that achieved CarbonNeutral® product certification. In 2019, 
we launched our Card Take Back Program that enables US 
Card Members to return both plastic and non-plastic cards  
by mail for recycling. Since the launch of the program, we’ve 
recycled more than 1.3 million cards, including cards returned 
by Card Members.

Increasing paperless  
payments and statements

In 2021, 95% of Card Member 
payments were electronic19  
and 66% of statements were 
paperless,20 up from 94% and 61%, 
respectively, in 2020. 

19.  “Electronic” includes payments received via phone, online, Auto Pay, third-party remits and wire transfers

Partnering to create a sustainable, low-carbon future for travel

In our 2022 Global Travel  
Trends Report, 78% of 
respondents stated that they  
want to have a positive impact on 
the community they are visiting.21 

Travel is a key part of our services and heritage. Our ESG 
efforts in this area start at home by offsetting our carbon 
footprint associated with employee business travel— 
including third-party air, rail, and rental cars. To reduce  
the impact of executive travel, for example, we continue  
to scale up our use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in  
our corporate jet fleet. 

We are also a member of the World Economic Forum’s  
Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition, which supports efforts  
to transition to sustainable aviation fuel and achieve carbon 
neutral air travel across the aviation sector. We also signed on 
to the Clean Skies for Tomorrow 2030 Ambition Statement,  
to accelerate the supply and use of sustainable aviation  
fuel technologies to reach 10% of the global jet aviation fuel 
supply by 2030. 

Additionally, through our Global Insights and Advisory Team,  
we offer our large and global corporate customers data-driven 
insights into the changes in business travel due to the 
pandemic, data that can help benchmark their existing travel 
polices against their peers and reporting on considerations  
on the environmental impact of business travel generally. 

In 2021, we partnered with the World Economic Forum on 
several initiatives. As a member of the World Economic  
Forum’s Global Future Council on Sustainable Tourism, we are 
working with government, business, and academic leaders  
to advance innovation on inclusive and sustainable tourism.

BOOM SUPERSONIC: INVESTING 
AND PARTNERING TO SUPPORT 
SUSTAINABLE TRAVEL

In March 2021, our Ventures team announced our 
strategic investment in this innovative aerospace 
company Boom Supersonic, which is seeking to 
build a supersonic and sustainable airliner. 

Our backing is expected to help fund the continued 
development of the Overture, Boom’s flagship 
product. The Overture is anticipated to be able  
to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel, 
including biofuels manufactured using renewable 
materials, and other low-carbon fuel technologies. 

We also became a founding member of the Boom 
Sustainable Travel Forum, a partnership to forge 
relationships and exchange ideas with the private 
sector, NGOs, and industry experts, which convened 
for the first time at the inaugural Net Good Summit 
in November 2021.

BACKING OUR COMMUNITIES 

We seek to advance climate solutions through programs and initiatives 
that help build more climate-resilient and equitable communities.  

In 2021, we set a goal to provide at least $10 million in support by the end of 2025 for  
initiatives, partnerships, and programs that address the adverse effects of climate change  
and pollution on communities. To support this goal, we launched a new community giving  
priority: Backing Low-Carbon Communities. 

$3.1M

TOWARD OUR $10 MILLION COMMITMENT

In 2022, we announced $3.1 million in  
grants to American Forests, the National 
Park Foundation, Save the Children UK, 
C40 Cities, and Earthwatch Institute to 
support nature-based solutions and 
sustainability efforts in local communities, 
particularly in urban areas.

“ We are grateful for the incredible commitment American Express has made  
to support Tree Equity and climate resiliency in cities. The work we’re doing 
together will boost the supply of trees that communities need to equitably 
cool and cleanse the air in their neighborhoods and create local jobs in the 
process, even giving us the capacity to expand this work to other countries.” 

– JAD DALEY, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF AMERICAN FORESTS 

Community giving to advance low-carbon and nature-based solutions 

Backing Low-Carbon Communities grants support nature-based solutions, community-led  
climate initiatives, and disaster response and resilience efforts in local communities, particularly 
in urban areas. Since last year’s announcement of our philanthropic commitment of $10 million 
by 2025, we have provided $3.1 million in grants to help back low-carbon communities,  
including grants to: 

 American Forests to support its 
Tree Equity program by bringing more 
native and climate-resilient trees to 
four US cities where American Express 
has offices: Phoenix, New York, Salt 
Lake City, and Sunrise, Florida.  
The grant will provide support to  
help identify and increase local tree 
nurseries, plant urban forests, and 
create entry-level jobs to help 
historically marginalized populations 
transition into the tree care industry. 
Additionally, the grant will help  
expand Tree Equity Score to its first 
international location, a tool that 
indicates whether neighborhoods  
have enough trees for everyone to 
experience their health, economic  
and, climate benefits.

 C40 Cities to fund its efforts to develop consumption-based 

emissions inventories in New York City and London to inform  
a suite of actions to incentivize more sustainable consumption 
in collaboration with people and businesses. The project is 
also expected to pioneer new ways for other cities to measure 
emissions from urban consumption. Announced in May 2022 
by New York City Mayor Eric Adams and C40 Chair and  
Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, this partnership will help both 
cities in delivering C40’s Good Food Declaration by providing 
data and insights to increase access to nutritious food and 
reduce food waste.   

 Earthwatch Institute to fund the planting of a Tiny Forest  

in the United Kingdom, helping to mitigate the impacts of 
climate change and enhance biodiversity. The grant will also 
provide planting, maintenance, and monitoring volunteer 
opportunities to our colleagues and support the creation of  
a Climate Change Master Class for our colleague base. The 
class, led by scientists, will provide education and tools to  
help our colleagues reduce the impacts of climate change.   

Supporting resilient communities globally 

We continued to fund disaster relief and response efforts 
around the world, as we have for many years. To build on 
these efforts, we are providing support for disaster relief  
and resilience building programs and initiatives to help 
create climate-resilient communities in extreme weather 
prone areas and cities where our colleagues and customers 
live and work. These grants aim to build capacity for 
mitigating the impacts of climate change, focusing on areas 
such as land management, water stewardship, climate 
resilience and adaptation, and education.

RALLYING INTO ACTION  
AFTER EXTREME  
WEATHER EVENTS 

As extreme weather events disrupted communities 
worldwide throughout 2021, we were there to help with 
more than $650,000 for disaster response, working with 
organizations such as the Red Cross, Feeding America, 
and the International Medical Corps. Our support focused 
on addressing the immediate needs of those who have 
been injured or displaced, providing temporary shelter  
and meals for first responders and affected families, 
distributing clean-up supplies, and connecting affected 
people to mental health support, COVID-19 supplies, and 
other assistance.

Through these partnerships and resources, we backed 
communities in need in connection with the following 
extreme weather events and natural disasters:   

• Floods devastated Germany and Western Europe 

• Multiple tornadoes swept across the Midwest and Southern US

• Winter storms resulted in widespread power outages in Texas

• Hurricane Ida brought catastrophic wind damage, rain, 

flooding, and dangerous tornadoes to the US Gulf Coast  
and Northeast

• Wildfires in California destroyed hundreds of homes and 

businesses and forced citizens across the state to evacuate

• A 7.2 magnitude earthquake resulted in widespread damage 

and left thousands in need of support in Haiti

We engage our colleagues by matching eligible 
colleague contributions toward disaster relief 
through the American Express Match program, 
recommending charities, and connecting US 
colleagues to information about becoming an 
American Red Cross disaster response volunteer.

SUPPORTING CLIMATE ACTION GLOBALLY 

To help fight the impact of climate change on the most vulnerable populations across Asia and Africa, we have partnered  
with Save the Children U.K. to develop and execute programs that engage youth to help reduce food insecurity exacerbated  
by climate change, support climate-resilient economic development and skills training through green job opportunities, and 
strengthen early warning systems to help these communities better prepare for extreme weather events.

As part of these activities, we announced a $600,000 grant to support Adolescent Skills  
for Successful Transition, an educational program on sustainable practices and products,  
and to fund the development of a Green Climate Fund pipeline 
for youth-led climate adaptation projects.

In Sierra Leone, Save the Children U.K. 
is conducting research in 20 highly 
climate-vulnerable communities along 
the coastline. The goal is to provide 
ideas to enhance opportunities for 
innovation and sustainable income 
generation in the coastal community.  
A special emphasis is to ensure women 
and youth have access to new skills, 
networks, markets, and institutions  
to become more climate-resilient and 
enhance sustainable development.

BUILDING FINANCIAL CONFIDENCE AND RESILIENCE FOR 
OUR COLLEAGUES, CUSTOMERS, AND COMMUNITIES

At American Express, building financial 
confidence—for our colleagues, our customers, 
and in our communities—is a natural extension 
of our role as a global financial services leader 
and is a core pillar of our ESG strategy.  

Our efforts to build financial confidence start at home with our 
colleagues. Through competitive benefits, financial support 
such as additional contributions to US colleagues’ retirement 
accounts, and skill-building opportunities like our Harvard 
Leadership Edge program, we are helping our colleagues build 
their financial confidence and resilience. 

For our customers, we’re empowering individuals to build  
and maintain their financial well-being through products and 
services, such as MyCredit Guide and Score Goals and our 
new all-digital US consumer checking account. We also 
continue to support local small businesses through initiatives 
like Shop Small and Small Business Saturday.

In our communities, we are helping build resilience through 
grants, programs, and initiatives that support economic 
empowerment and equity. We are expanding our reach into our 
communities through partnerships, such as our Backing Small 
grant programs that support economically vulnerable small 
business owners, and an expanded global partnership with 
Junior Achievement Worldwide to provide financial literacy 
education and training to students in 11 countries. Through our 
American Express Center for Community Development (CCD), 
we provided $265 million in community development loans  
and investments in 2021 that supported small business needs, 
job creation and retention, and affordable housing.

We are excited to share progress against our goals and 
highlights from our new and longstanding programs. You’ll  
also learn about how we are addressing common challenges 
within our industry, from strengthening data privacy and 
security to protecting our customers against fraud.  

Read on to learn more about how we have been helping our colleagues, 
customers, and communities build financial confidence.

BACKING OUR COLLEAGUES

Building financial confidence starts at home, with our colleagues.

Building financial knowledge and providing 
planning resources 

Whether planning for college, buying a home, or budgeting 
daily expenses, smart saving pays off. We help our colleagues 
build their knowledge and skills for all life stages through our 
global Smart Saving programs. 

In the US, this includes financial planning coaching sessions 
and workshops, retirement webinars, and on-demand access 
to financial education resources, as well as offers for savings 
on everyday expenses. 

Through our financial planning partner, Goldman Sachs  
Ayco Personal Financial Management (Ayco), we provide  
US colleagues access to Ayco’s Financial Wellness program 
which includes a digital platform, one-on-one guidance from a 
financial coach as well as financial planning webinars offered 
throughout the year. We connect US colleagues to digital  
tools and resources to help their financial decision-making  
on topics ranging from debt management, benefits, 

retirement, investing, tax planning, and estate planning.  
US Colleagues can also track their income and spending  
habits and work with a coach to make goals and a plan to 
achieve them. We also partnered with certain of our colleague 
networks in 2021 and held network-specific workshops  
to educate, encourage coaching sessions, and promote  
the platform.

For the third consecutive year, we helped our US colleagues 
manage their student debt through the SAVEtember and  
Smart Saving Student Debt Programs. These programs 
provided 300 colleagues with student debt a $500 cash award 
once they completed a financial wellness assessment and 
attended a financial well-being webinar on managing student 
loan debt. Through the American Express Scholarship  
Program, we also help American Express colleagues in the  
US and Canada fund their children’s undergraduate college 
education through scholarship awards based on financial  
need that range from $2,000 to $4,000 per year. In 2021,  
these scholarships totaled over $365,000.

Over 1,500 colleagues  
enrolled in our first 2021  
offering of Harvard Leadership  
Edge, a hands-on, customized  
eight-week program for building 
leadership skills.

Encouraging retirement savings

Retirement funds are a great way to build financial confidence 
for the future. For US colleagues, we match 100% of 401(k) 
contributions up to 6% of total pay after six months of service, 
and all matching contributions are immediately vested.

94%

In 2021, 94% of US colleagues  
took advantage of our retirement 
plan, up from 93% in 2020.

For 2021, US new hires were automatically enrolled at 3% of 
total pay, with a 1% automatic annual increase up to 10% of 
total pay. For 2022, US new hires are automatically enrolled  
at 6% of total pay. Those previously enrolled at 3%, will be 
brought up to 6%, and will continue with an annual automatic 
increase of 1% up to 10% of total pay.

Resources that keep careers growing 

Colleagues have access to a wide variety of resources: career 
coaching, mentoring, professional networking, and rotation 
opportunities, as well as courses on demand and with 
classroom-style instruction. Since 2018, our New People 
Leader Program, for example, has helped more than 3,000 
first-time managers through the executive level prepare for 
their new roles. 

When analysts, team leaders, managers, and directors sought 
hands-on, customized ways to build their leadership skills, we 
responded with Harvard Leadership Edge. Based on colleague 
feedback, this eight-week program is grounded in our 
Leadership Behaviors, with self-guided lessons colleagues  
can apply on the job. Over 1,500 colleagues enrolled in our  
first 2021 offering of Harvard Leadership Edge. 

~1M

Colleagues viewed 
nearly 1 million 
LinkedIn Learning 
videos in 2021.

Professional growth and development are another important 
aspect of financial confidence. Our investment here starts  
with opportunities for colleagues to learn on the job, build 
cross-functional skills, and grow in their careers through a 
defined, collaborative process for performance management.

We also made available to colleagues LinkedIn Learning, a 
platform that provides quick and easy access to thousands  
of online courses and videos. The platform offers lessons in 
seven languages on topics including leadership, business 
skills, technology, and personal development.

BACKING OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS

We are focused on strengthening the financial security and money management capacity of small 
businesses through products, services, campaigns, and initiatives, and empowering individuals  
to build and maintain their financial well-being through products, services, tools, and education, 
while providing robust account security.   

Expanding our long-term efforts to back small businesses

Supporting small businesses worldwide  
through Shop Small 

We launched Small Business Saturday in 2010 to help 
independent retailers and restaurants gain more customers  
in the wake of the financial crisis. Over the past 12 years, the 
campaign has evolved into a tradition for consumers and 
merchants across the United States. US consumers reported 
spending an estimated $163 billion4 at small businesses on 
Small Business Saturday since the movement started, and 
2021 marked a record year, with an 18% increase in total 
estimated projected spending from 2020.5

Shop Small has grown into a global, year-round movement. To 
address the challenges of the pandemic, we strengthened our 
support even more. In 2020, we committed more than $200 
million to jumpstart spending at small businesses, and in 2021 
committed $100 million to our Let’s Go Shop Small campaign.6 

Small Business Saturday’s impact expands beyond the 
merchants and individuals making purchases on one particular 
day. In the American Express 2021 Small Business Saturday 
Consumer Insights Survey, 70% of survey respondents reported 
that Small Business Saturday makes them want to encourage 
others to shop at small, independently owned retailers, too.7

On Small Business  
Saturday 2021, US consumers  
reported spending an estimated  
$23.3 billion at independent  
retailers and restaurants, up from an 
estimated $19.8 billion in 2020, the 
highest projected spending to date.8 

4.   This spend statistic is an aggregate of the average spend as reported by consumers who shopped small on Small Business Saturday in surveys commissioned  

6.   Our commitment of up to $200 million in 2020 supported a Card Member offer and the associated marketing campaign to encourage American Express Card 

by American Express reporting spend habits on Small Business Saturday since 2012. It does not reflect actual receipts or sales. Each such survey was conducted 
online among a nationally representative sample of US adults. The data was projected from the samples based on then-current US Census estimates of the US  
adult population (18+).

5.    The American Express 2020 Small Business Saturday Consumer Insights Survey was conducted by Teneo on behalf of American Express and the National 

Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). The study is a nationally representative sample of 2,572 US adults 18 years of age or older. The sample was collected 
using an email invitation and an online survey. The study gathered self-reported data and does not reflect actual receipts or sales. It was conducted anonymously  
on November 29, 2020. The survey has an overall margin of error of +/- 2.0%, at the 95% level of confidence. Projections are based on the current US Census 
estimates of the US adult population, age 18 years and over.

Our small business resources also responded to specific challenges and needs outside  
the United States. 

MAKING A BIG IMPACT FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES WORLDWIDE

• In Japan, we collaborated with a delivery 
platform on discount offers, used crowd-
funding to drive support for small restaurants 
impacted by the pandemic, and provided 
sanitization tool kits to help small business 
owners welcome their customers safely. 

• In the UK, consumers reported spending  

an estimated £598 million at small 
businesses on Small Business Saturday,  
held December 4, 2021.9

• In Canada, approximately 145,000 Card 
Members enrolled in Shop Small offers, 
driving 582,000 redemptions at more than 
90,000 merchants in 2021.

• In Australia, American Express has given  

$24 million and more than 1.5 billion points 
back to Card Members through Shop Small 
offers from 2013 through 2021.

Our flagship Shop Small campaign encourages consumers worldwide to 
support their local independent businesses. To address the challenges  
of the pandemic, we committed more than $100 million to encourage 
customers to support small businesses as part of our Let’s Go Shop 
Small campaign in 2021.

In the UK, for example, our research showed that targeted social media drove UK consumers 
to spend more with small businesses. To connect consumers and merchants, we created an 
online map and shared Social Spotlights of four independent businesses in London. Overall, 
UK consumers reported spending an estimated £598 million at small businesses on Small 
Business Saturday in the UK.9

In Australia, thousands of businesses took 
part in Shop Small, including many micro-
businesses. “The resilience that Australian 
small business operators have shown 
throughout the COVID-19 crisis has been 
extraordinary. And it’s encouraging to see 
consumers, big business, and government 
rallying to back the sector, but now is not the  
time for complacency,” says Lisa Belcher, Vice 
President of Small and Medium Enterprises 
for American Express in Australia. “That’s why 
Shop Small is returning to remind shoppers 
that if they want to see these businesses 
survive, they have to take action and spend 
with them regularly.”

9.  Estimated spend based on data collected from 4,000 UK adults polled by market research agency Opinium between 5pm on Saturday 4 December 2021 and 10pm 
on Sunday 5 December 2021. The £598 million figure for national spending calculated using ONS estimation of the UK adult population based on self-reported 
shopper estimates of spend and does not reflect actual receipts or sales.

Educational resources to support  
small business growth

Our global network of Customer Care 
Professionals is just one way we have our 
customers’ backs. Small and mid-size firms 
often lack the time, tools, and resources to 
pursue business growth opportunities or gain 
new skills and expertise. Business Advocacy 
programs such as Business Class address this 
need through lifestyle-like content and 
experiences, including articles, events, video 
series, Instagram Live content, and more—all 
available to business owners at no cost.

In 2021, we debuted the first season of a new 
video series called Business Class: The Series 
that takes viewers around the world and 
across industries to learn real-life lessons  
from fellow entrepreneurs. Episodes explore 
different ways to approach everyday business 
challenges including leadership, finance, 
marketing, strategy, and managing growth. 

We made learning interactive with two  
new seasons of “Office Hours”—casual  
and informative conversations taking place  
live on Instagram, where entrepreneurs and 
experts answer business owners’ questions 
and offer advice. To help thousands of small 
businesses owners network and grow their 

capital and customers budgets, we hosted 
our annual free, Business Class LIVE event, 
where they virtually connected with and 
learned from leading thinkers, business 
executives, and entrepreneurs.

Our powerful backing for the 
restaurant community 

In 2019 we acquired the restaurant booking 
platform Resy and together we help restaurant 
businesses thrive. 

Throughout the pandemic, we supported 
independent restaurants by providing fee  
relief and digital tools to help them run their 
businesses, data-based insights to help 
restaurants plan smarter, marketing and 
programming to back the restaurant 
community, and incentives for Card Members 
to order take out. 

As the impacts of the pandemic continued in 
2021, American Express and Resy responded 
with a series of initiatives to drive customers 
to small independent restaurants to help  
with their recovery and long-term growth. In 
February 2021, we launched the Order In, Help 
Out campaign that encouraged consumers to 
make #TakeoutTuesday a weekly occurrence 
and introduced new dining offers on certain 
American Express Cards.

In 2022, we followed up with “Every Resy 
Counts,” a reservation drive as part of the 
Shop Small campaign that encouraged 
millions of people across the country to dine 
at independent restaurants in March 2022. 
The “Every Resy Counts” initiative is part  
of our broader “Let’s Grab a Table” Shop 
Small marketing campaign which was 
focused on bringing attention and support  
to independent restaurants throughout the 
United States. To help these restaurants rally 
their customers, we created complimentary 
toolkits with content, social media posts, 
signage, and more, as well as specially 
curated offers, and videos and articles from 
industry experts to help them grow and 
manage their businesses.

“ The industry is starting to see 
the effect of the past two years. 
And that’s when companies like 
Amex and Resy step up huge to 
say, this has to change. We have 
to be there for the industry.”

Helping individuals improve their financial health with confidence

Building financial confidence opens doors for people to enrich their lives.  

One of our ESG objectives is to empower individuals to build 
and maintain their financial well-being through products, 
services, tools, and education. In fall 2021, we announced two 
new goals: to provide access to credit to at least four million 
individuals from underserved or underrepresented populations 
from 2021 through 2025, and provide at least five million 
individuals with tools, resources, and educational content  
to improve financial well-being from 2021 through 2025. 

We seek to make available financial education resources and 
financial literacy programs to young people, first-time credit 
users, and experienced credit users who want to improve  
their financial management skills. Our efforts are also  
focused on product transparency, responsible marketing, 
non-discrimination throughout the credit lifecycle, and  
robust privacy and security programs.

Expanding our reach in financial  
management and education 

With MyCredit Guide and Score Goals, we helped millions 
manage their credit. Free to all consumers on our website, 
MyCredit Guide provides one-stop access to a user’s 

VantageScore® 3.0 credit score, as well as a detailed 
TransUnion personal credit report and a credit score  
simulator to see how actions like paying down debt or  
opening a new account could affect their score. Users can  
also sign up for instant email alerts for any changes in their 
credit reports.

Through our US-based Credit Intel Financial Education  
Center, we help consumers enhance their knowledge  
about building credit, understanding credit reports, and 
understanding different types of credit cards, features, and 
benefits. The site shows how credit scores work—and how  
to improve them.

As of May 1, 2022, MyCredit 
Guide had more than 4.5 million 
enrolled users. In 2021, the 
Credit Intel site attracted 2.8 
million unique visitors—up from 
1.1 million in 2020.

JOINING FORCES WITH INNOVATIVE STARTUPS

Helping global consumers gain access to credit in the US

To connect people worldwide to new and innovative ways of building their  
financial confidence, Amex teamed up with Zogo Financial Education.

When college student Bolun Li realized how little his peers 
knew about financial literacy topics like taxes and insurance 
deductibles, he responded with a solution tailored 
specifically for his generation: Zogo Financial Education,  
an app designed to make financial education about debt 
repayment, health insurance, homebuying and more, fun.  
In 2021, we partnered with Zogo on a pilot program to offer 
custom-tailored content and additional incentives embedded 
within the app’s gamified experience. This joint effort 
provided Gen Z users with an opportunity to gain valuable 
financial literacy skills toward their financial well-being.

Amex Ventures also invested in the startup BodesWell  
in 2020, and American Express and BodesWell later  
co-developed and launched the pilot product My Financial 
Plan in 2021, a self-service financial planning tool designed 
to give Card Member users a complete picture of their 
financial health and help them make and work toward  
major life goals, such as buying a house or retirement. 

The pilot launched in July 2021 and has provided select American Express Card 
Members with the opportunity to try out My Financial Plan, to see how income, assets, 
expenses, liabilities, and cash flow come together for planning life events.

Many newcomers to the United States lack access to US credit due to their international credit 
histories being “stopped at the border.” Since 2019, we’ve been backing the efforts of San 
Francisco-based fintech Nova Credit to address this problem. 

Nova Credit’s Credit Passport® seamlessly and securely integrates 
into the American Express online card application process, enabling 
applicants’ credit records from certain international credit reporting 

agencies to be instantly translated into a US-equivalent credit report and score in just a few 
clicks allowing American Express to make an application decision.

This industry-first integration has helped thousands of newcomers from Australia, Canada, India, 
Mexico, and the UK access their credit reports and get approved for an American Express Card. 
In December 2021, we expanded the application’s reach to people from four more countries: 
Brazil, Dominican Republic, Kenya, and Nigeria. 

“ Our work with American Express over the past two years has shown us the 
sheer impact access to financial services has on newcomers. Nova Credit 
now has the ability to help even more newcomers experience financial 
success as they navigate the tumultuous process of immigration— 
supporting our ultimate mission for newcomers to arrive and thrive.”

Protecting our customers

Cybersecurity and customer privacy

Our customers trust us with their valuable financial and 
personal information. 

Continued advancement in fraud prevention

American Express maintains industry-leading fraud rates 
among major card networks through practices that engage 
customers and merchants, respond to escalating threats, 
leverage new technologies, and more.

• Data protection: Our Data Protection and Privacy Principles 

guide how we collect, use, store, share, transmit, delete,  
or otherwise process customers’ personal data. With 
cybersecurity threats on the rise, we continue to enhance  
our information security program. Our information security 
program is designed to identify risks and protect the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data, as  
well as our information systems. We also maintain an 
enterprise-wide incident response program.

• Privacy: Our Privacy Statement describes how we collect, 
use, and share data when customers use our online or  
mobile products and services, and the choices they can  
make related to marketing, sharing, and targeted advertising. 
We inform our customers about the personal information  
we collect, and the choices they have related to the sharing  
of personal information, through product-specific privacy 
notices. Our website’s Privacy Center also provides US 
customers with transparent, simple-to-use resources.

American Express has maintained 
the lowest US fraud rates among 
major card networks for the past  
15 years, according to the 
February 2022 Nilson Report.

15 YEARS

We ran a Card Member Fraud Education campaign in 2020  
and 2021 that used social media to teach customers how to 
stay vigilant against attempts to steal online login credentials, 
card details, and other personally identifiable information.  
For businesses, our wholly-owned subsidiary Accertify 
launched Refund Abuse Protection in 2021, which is designed 
to help merchants mitigate fraudulent refund requests. This 
complements and augments the capabilities of Digital Identity, 
which Accertify introduced in 2020 to help businesses 
address fraudulent online account openings and takeovers. 

Across payment channels, we continue to invest in more 
secure connections and authentication mechanisms. For our 
US customers, we deploy behavioral analytics that can help 
identify and stop fraud during the application process.

Merchants who used our Enhanced Authorization 
process to identify parties on the other end of a 
financial transaction typically saw fewer false 
positives and fraud reduction of up to 60%.  

We enhance our monitoring tools, controls, and policies for 
fraud detection and prevention with our “closed loop” 
relationships with Card Members and merchants. We have 
access to information at both ends of the card transaction and 
build algorithms and other analytical tools designed to identify 
and reduce fraud. Our integrated payments platform allows us 
to analyze information on Card Member spending while 
respecting Card Member preferences and protecting Card 
Member and merchant data in compliance with applicable 
policies and legal requirements.

BACKING OUR COMMUNITIES

Building financial confidence is important in the communities where we live, work, and operate. To 
this end, we’ve created goals to support economic empowerment and equity through grants, 
programs, and initiatives.  

• Backing underrepresented-owned businesses:  

American Express and the US Black Chambers, Inc. worked 
together to expand ByBlack with the launch of the first 
national certification program exclusively for Black-owned 
businesses. First created as an extensive directory of  
Black-owned businesses, this no-cost digital platform  
now unlocks more ways to reach new customers and  
secure contracts for Black-owned businesses across the 
United States. ByBlack provides businesses an approved 
accreditation and enables consumers and other companies 
to easily find US-based Black-owned businesses.

We’re proud of our progress so far. Toward our goal of  
investing $500 million in building more resilient and equitable 
communities from 2021 through 2025, we have underwritten 
$265 million in community development loans and 
investments in 2021 through The American Express Center  
for Community Development (CCD). These funds support 
small business needs, job creation and retention, and 
affordable housing, including the development of more than 
1,900 units of affordable housing.

We also continue to expand our Backing Small initiative, 
including $17 million in funds committed through 2024 to 
support underrepresented and economically vulnerable small 
business owners and entrepreneurs and includes grant 
programs, mentoring support, and technical assistance 
through established community partnerships.  

Programs include:

• The Coalition to Back Black Businesses 

• Backing Historic Small Restaurants

• Backing International Small Restaurants

• Inclusive Backing

• Blueprint: Backing BIPOC Businesses in Canada 

• First Nations Business Growth Program in Australia

A CONTINUING COMMITMENT TO  
BACK BLACK BUSINESSES

50% of grantees saw an 
increase in sales revenue  
in the second half of 2021 
after receiving a Coalition  
to Back Black Businesses 
grant, compared to 33%  
of Black-owned businesses 
who did not receive a grant.10

50%

The Coalition to Back Black Businesses (CBBB), 
founded in partnership with the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce Foundation and four national Black 
chambers, is now in its third year. In February 2022, 
amid supply-chain disruptions and the continuing 
pandemic, we announced that an additional 491  
Black-owned small businesses across 39 states were 
each awarded a $5,000 grant as part of our multi-year, 
$10 million commitment and are eligible to apply for 
enhancement grants of $25,000 annually.

Backing Small for underrepresented and economically 
vulnerable small business owners   

Through our Backing Small initiative, we provide financial support and resources to economically 
vulnerable small business owners. 

Our Backing Small grant programs help build inclusive 
economic growth and empowerment in our communities  
by supporting capital, financial education, literacy  
programs, mentoring, and training for underrepresented  
and economically vulnerable small business owners  

and individuals.

Highlights include:

• Backing Historic Small Restaurants: This campaign 

supports restaurants that contribute to their neighborhood’s 
unique history and identity as they face ongoing challenges 
resulting from the pandemic. To qualify, restaurants must be 
small and/or independently owned, located in a historic 
building or neighborhood, and have been in business for at 
least 25 years.

  We first launched this initiative in February 2021, working  
with the National Trust for Historic Preservation to help  
small restaurants that have contributed to the fabric of  
their communities so they can better serve their customers, 
financially recover, and grow their businesses. In March 
2022, we announced a second round of Backing Historic 
Small Restaurants with the National Trust for Historic 
Preservation to award $40,000 grants to another 25  
historic small restaurants throughout the United States. 

• Backing International Small Restaurants: This new grant 
program with the International Downtown Association 
Foundation brought our support for small restaurants to  
the international stage, supporting independent restaurants 
in London, Mexico City, Sydney, Tokyo, and Toronto with 
community significance, operated by underserved 
populations or in economic need.

BACKING COMMUNITY CAFÉS IN BRIXTON AND ‘REBEL IN THE KITCHEN’ IN MEXICO

As part of the Dine Local program, run by the International 
Downtown Association and Brixton BID, and supported by 
American Express, 10 independent Brixton restaurants 
received £5,000 grants to make critical improvements to  
drive their business forward. Among the recipients is Lounge 
Brixton, which is supporting local artists by expanding its live 
performance space; Papa’s Café, a park-based community 
cafe serving local residents; and family-run restaurant Banh 
Banh Café, that plans to use the grant money to install new 
kitchen equipment.

In March 2022, the IDA and the Placemaking México 
Foundation, supported by American Express, announced  
ten restaurants in Mexico that would receive the equivalent  
of $7,500 in Mexican pesos for adjustments and renovations 
to support their operations as part of the Backing 
International Small Restaurants program. One of the 
recipients is Doña Vero. Located at Colonia La Roma Sur, the 
eponymously named restaurant is a Mexican kitchen concept 
that combines pre-Hispanic and traditional flavors together 
with exotic and nutritional ingredients. The restaurant, run by 
its namesake, brings inclusion to gastronomy, running special 
tastings for people with disabilities and supporting local 
causes and businesses.

• Inclusive Backing: Our Inclusive Backing grant program, in partnership with Main Street 
America, will provide 330 grants of $5,000 each to small business owners located in  
older or historic commercial districts across the country. The program will give priority to 
businesses that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and give preference 
to businesses owned by underrepresented groups, including people of color, people with 
disabilities, women, and others.  

SUPPORTING ECONOMICALLY VULNERABLE SMALL 
BUSINESSES

In February 2022, we launched the second of four grant cycles as part of the Inclusive 
Backing grant program in partnership with Main Street America. “Services that Back Us” 
will support small businesses in the personal service industry in the US that were deeply 
affected by the pandemic as early shutdowns and changing consumer behavior impacted 
foot traffic and revenue. The program awarded 75 personal service industry small 
businesses in older or historic commercial districts with a $5,000 grant to be used toward 
critical needs such as physical and digital improvements, new equipment, technology, and 
training to support their financial recovery and growth.  

The Inclusive Backing grant program with Main Street America will provide more than  
300 grants of $5,000 each throughout 2022 over four cycles, including the “Services that 
Back Us” cycle described above. The program will give preference to businesses owned by 
underrepresented groups, including members of the LGBTQ+ community, people with 
disabilities, Veterans, women, and people of color.

Inclusive Backing for AAPI-Owned Small Businesses

“ It’s encouragement. It’s recognition,” says Ming-Yu 
Wu, Owner of the Wicked BAO restaurant in 
Fernandina Beach, Florida. “It means that someone 
out there is supporting the AAPI community.”  

Our Inclusive Backing grant program, in partnership with Main 
Street America, is part of our Backing Small initiative to 
support small business owners.

In February 2022, we announced the first 75 grant recipients 
who identified as members of the Asian American and  
Pacific Islander (AAPI) community or persons with disabilities.  
Four of these small business owners who are members of  
the AAPI community shared what these grants mean for  
their businesses.   

“ This is a grant that will help us keep our doors 
open while we continue to serve our community,” 
says James Dong, Owner of Last Minute Gear in 
San Francisco.

Arianne Wing talked about being able to carry on the heritage 
of the L.T. Sue & Co. Tea Room & Emporium, her family’s 
multigenerational restaurant in Hanford, California’s China  
Alley Historic District. 

For Irene Tsukada Simonian—Owner of the Bunkado gift shop  
in Los Angeles’ Little Tokyo, the grant “validates all of the hard 
work that I put into this as well as my parents and my aunt and 
uncle who started this business.”  

INCLUSIVE BACKING FOR VETERANS

“ I am a retired U.S. Army and Pennsylvania Army National 
Guardsman and together, my wife and I created our 
business as a mom-and-pop hoagie shop. Most sandwich 
shops around here are franchises, so we wanted to bring 
something special to our local community. Community to 
us is everything—we have customers who travel hours to 
our shop because they heard about us from a friend and 
customers can buy a meal and place it on our “pay it 
forward” board which will go toward the less fortunate. 
But between the pandemic and the current challenges 
met by inflation, this Inclusive Backing grant has been 
incredibly encouraging. A portion of the grant will be  
used to build a wheelchair ramp so we can offer a more 
inclusive environment and additional funds will be used 
toward insulation and re-siding to make the shop more 
energy efficient because with costs continuing to rise,  
we need to save money where we can.”

FACILITATING ACCESS TO MENTORS AND MORE IN CANADA

For small businesses, mentorship can be a valuable tool for 
solving difficult business challenges—and it’s a resource  
that many Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) 
entrepreneurs in Canada lack. In a survey we commissioned  
of Canadian business owners, close to half (48%) of BIPOC 
respondents reported that they lacked mentors to help  
solve difficult business challenges, compared to just 32%  
of white entrepreneurs.11

We responded with the Blueprint: Backing BIPOC Businesses™ 
mentorship and grant program. The mentorship program, made 
possible by a grant from the American Express Foundation, 
brought in seasoned mentors and subject-matter experts  
to talk about topics ranging from strategic planning and 
leadership to operations management and financial modeling. 
One hundred participants from British Columbia to 
Newfoundland took part in group workshops, one-on-one 
coaching, and small group learning sessions. 

$10K

Each one of the 100 
participants received a 
$10,000 grant to fuel the 
growth of their business.

“ As a Black entrepreneur, I’ve always struggled with not  
only raising capital but finding a mentor and other BIPOC 
entrepreneurs to connect with,” says Harry Julmice, Owner  
of the Montreal-based content and production agency Never  
Was Average. “Through the Blueprint program, I’m hopeful  
that the mentorship component will help me save time, 
resources, and energy by providing me with the tools,  
guidance, and support I need to achieve my goals and build  
a sustainable business,” he adds.

“ Women make up such a small percentage of Canadians 
working in the construction sector, and one of my goals is  
to help reduce some of those barriers to entry,” says Miyoko 
Oikawa, Owner of Toronto-based construction consulting 
company Building Energy Matters. “The mentor I’ve been 
matched with is assisting me in my development as an  
industry leader, and I’m confident that guidance will help me 
pay it forward with supporting other women in the industry.”

We supplemented this effort with $10,000 grants for each  
of the 100 participants to fuel the growth of their business.  
In addition, all eligible businesses among the program’s  
1,000-plus applicants received access to the “Launchpad for 
Blueprint” online skills development platform.

11.  This survey was conducted by The Nielsen Company on behalf of American Express from April 9 to April 29, 2021, among 1,124 Canadian business owners or partners in small or medium enterprises, 596 of which  

self-identify as Black, Indigenous or a Person of Color (BIPOC) and 528 of which self-identify as white.

Working together to expand financial literacy 

Across the US and around the world, nonprofits are at work helping to make communities and 
individuals more financially resilient. American Express partners with several of these nonprofits, 
using our resources to help extend their reach and amplify their impact. 

Supporting financial literacy for K-12 students 

We formed a new partnership with the Council for 
Economic Education (CEE), whose mission is to 
equip K-12 students with the tools and knowledge 
of personal finance and economics so that they 
can make better decisions for themselves,  
their families, and their communities. Our latest 
grant will support teacher training in low- or 
middle-income schools, financial literacy events 
for parents and their children, and presentations 
to students at community organizations  
supported by American Express.

Helping students around the world

Our global partnership with Junior Achievement Worldwide will provide financial literacy 
education and training to students in 11 countries including Canada, India, Hong Kong, Japan, 
and Mexico. The program’s main objectives include cultivating the attitudes and behaviors that 
young people need to become financially capable, focusing where possible on under represented 
and underserved communities. We plan to leverage our colleague volunteers to help teach and 
mentor students as part of the program and we expect the Junior Achievement Worldwide 
program to reach over 5,000 students.

INCREASING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE LOANS FOR 
UNDERSERVED WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS

$75K

granted to 
Grameen 
America, Inc. 
through our 
Center for 
Community 
Development

American Express grants aid community 
organizations in accomplishing their mission. In 
the US for example, a $75,000 grant to Grameen 
America, Inc. through our Center for Community 
Development is funding efforts to increase access 
to affordable loans to low-income, underserved 
women entrepreneurs. Through microloans 
invested in their small businesses, the program 
aims to create jobs, enhance financial literacy, 
boost incomes, and build credit. 

Funding homes and inclusive real estate development 

Housing is key to community resilience and financial confidence. Our contributions to 
the Equitable Path Forward loan fund provide capital, grants, and program support to 
BIPOC and other historically marginalized developers in the real estate and community 
development industry. The CCD has also invested in a 39-unit affordable housing 
development in New Mexico. Units are reserved for members of the Mescalero Apache 
Tribe, with 20% of the project’s units for tribal members who are homeless or at risk  
of homelessness.

OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 

Strong corporate governance starts at the top with diverse, experienced leadership,  
a culture of openness and accountability, and a comprehensive, considered structure of 
policies and practices.   

Our Corporate Governance Principles set the course for an 
ethical approach to business. Our Board of Directors and 
management review them to ensure they are appropriate 
and reflect our high standards and Blue Box Values.  
When recommending updates, the Board’s Nominating, 
Governance, and Public Responsibility Committee considers 
our shareholders’ views, as well as publicly available 
discourse on governance best practices. These principles, 
along with our Code of Conduct for colleagues, Code of 
Business Conduct for Members of the Board of Directors, 
and the charters of our Board’s four standing committees 
(Audit and Compliance; Compensation and Benefits; 
Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility; and 
Risk) make up our governance framework. Key governance 
policies and processes also include our comprehensive 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, our 
Whistleblower Claims Policy, our commitment to 
transparent financial reporting, and our strong internal 
checks and balances. Comprehensive management policies, 
many of which are approved at the Board committee level, 
guide our operations.

Our Board of Directors, a diverse group of leaders with 
substantial experience in their fields, oversees and sets  
the tone for operating responsibly. We continually review  
our Board’s composition to identify skills needed for the 
company, both in the near-term and into the future. 

The Nominating, Governance, and Public Responsibility 
Committee assesses potential candidates based on their 
history of achievement, the breadth of their business 
experiences, whether they bring specific skills or expertise  
in areas that the committee has identified as desired, and  
whether they possess personal attributes and experiences  
that will contribute to the sound functioning of our Board. 
Diversity is also a key consideration in our nomination and 
succession planning processes. Our Corporate Governance 
Principles provide that the Board should be diverse, engaged, 
and independent. When reviewing potential board nominees, 
the Nominating, Governance, and Public Responsibility 
Committee considers the holistic diversity of the Board, 
including gender, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and 
nationality, and does not discriminate on any basis. 

Learn more about diversity at American Express in the Promoting 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion section.

BOARD MEMBER DIVERSITY 

Eight (57%) of our 14 Board members are women 
and/or are from diverse races or ethnic backgrounds, 
including four members who identify as Black or 
African American, one member who identifies as 
Hispanic / Latinx, and four members who identify  
as women.

ESG GOVERNANCE

Our Board’s Nominating, Governance, and Public Responsibility 
Committee reviews our ESG Strategy and Corporate Sustainability 
program, monitors progress against our goals, and provides guidance  
on our efforts. 

The Compensation and Benefits Committee  
of the Board also oversees performance goals 
and certifies performance outcomes on key 
talent metrics. 

Our Executive Committee reviews and 
evaluates ESG performance and long-term 
goals with support from our ESG Steering 
Committee. 

The Risk Committee of the Board provides 
oversight of our ERM framework, along with  
the policies and procedures established by 
management to identify, assess, measure,  
and manage key risks facing the company, 
including ESG risks, and approves our ERM 
policy, which governs risk governance, risk 
oversight, and risk appetite. ESG risks—in 
particular climate risk—are included in our  
ERM framework and climate-related risks are 
currently managed as part of our ERM 
process.

Led by senior executives from across the 
company, the ESG Steering Committee 
developed the objectives and goals for our 
ESG strategy, drawing on the expertise of our 
four cross-functional ESG working groups: 

• Promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

• Advance Climate Solutions

• Build Financial Confidence

• ESG Disclosures 

Day to day, our Corporate Sustainability team  
works with colleagues throughout the 
company to shape our ESG programs and 
investments and monitor progress on key 
issues.

ESG AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Our executive compensation program is designed to support the company’s longevity and 
stability by driving long-term business outcomes, promoting strong governance practices, and 
encouraging responsible risk-taking. 

We do this by linking individual pay with company 
performance on a diverse set of measures, as well as financial 
and strategic goals.   

representation, talent retention, culture, and inclusion as  
part of the calculation to determine incentive compensation 
for all eligible colleagues. 

All senior executives have a large portion of compensation  
that is variable and covers annual and multi-year performance 
periods. The company scorecard incentivizes performance  
and includes key objectives in four categories: Shareholder, 
Customer, Colleague, and Strategic.

In 2021, the Compensation and Benefits Committee modified 
its charter to include a review of strategies relating to 
diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives as well as key talent 
metrics. We also increasingly link executive compensation to 
our ESG goals. For example, in years past, the company 
scorecard’s Colleague category included metrics for diversity 

In 2021, we also incorporated the management 
of key ESG priorities, including metrics, into  
our executive compensation program under 
the Strategic category of our annual scorecard.

Our Board’s Compensation and Benefits Committee oversees 
performance goals across our categories and certifies 
performance outcomes.

OUR BUSINESS ETHICS

BLUE BOX VALUES

Our Blue Box Values guide how we operate as a company and include the following principles 
that every colleague commits to embracing and working by each day: 

WE BACK OUR CUSTOMERS

WE EMBRACE DIVERSITY

WE MAKE IT GREAT

WE STAND FOR INCLUSION

WE DO WHAT’S RIGHT

WE WIN AS A TEAM

WE RESPECT PEOPLE 

WE SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES

We reinforce these values with our Code of Conduct, which 
establishes our expectations for ethical workplace behavior. 
The Code provides guidance on sensitive business practices 
such as gift-giving, expenses, appropriate technology use, 
conducting business with foreign governments, and protecting 
customer privacy. 

The Code is an essential part of our daily global operations. We 
publish the Code in nine languages and require all colleagues 
to take and certify an annual training on its provisions. Abiding 
by the Code is a condition of working at American Express, 
and violations can result in termination.

Colleagues are required to receive annual Global Regulatory 
Learning requirements on important policies, laws, and 
regulations that govern our industry, guide our company, and 
protect our colleagues, customers, and brand.

Empowering colleagues to report ethics concerns

We encourage colleagues, contractors, vendors, suppliers, and others to trust their instincts  
and feel comfortable raising concerns, from workplace conduct to suspected breaches of  
our Code of Conduct.

To raise these concerns, we provide our global Amex Ethics Hotline online and by phone 24/7, 
staffed by representatives who among them speak more than 170 languages. An independent 
organization hosts the hotline and reporters can provide information confidentially or 
anonymously where local laws allow. Specially trained individuals at American Express  
promptly review all concerns raised and investigate further when appropriate.

Our Whistleblower Claims Policy allows colleagues, contractors, customers, merchants, and 
others to report allegations in good faith without fear of retaliation or risk to their employment. 
Claims are investigated and recommendations are made by the Colleague Experience Group, 
Internal Audit Group, and Global Security, in consultation with our General Counsel’s 
Organization, as appropriate.  

Transparent and responsible corporate citizenship

We believe active engagement in the public policy arena is vital to the democratic process  
and an important part of responsible corporate citizenship. We are transparent about our  
policy engagement with governments, including through Lobbying Disclosure Act filings in  
the United States.

DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

Protecting our corporate, customer, and colleague 
information is a priority for us. With cybersecurity threats  
on the rise, we continue to enhance our global security 
measures. Our information and cybersecurity program is 
designed to identify risks and protect the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability of our data, as well as our 
information systems. The program is built upon a foundation 
of advanced security technology, a well-staffed and highly 
trained team of experts, and robust operations based on the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity 
Framework. This consists of controls designed to identify, 
protect, detect, respond, and recover from information and 
cybersecurity incidents. 

Through our cybersecurity governance framework, our 
internal teams report to the Board on cybersecurity at least 
once a year and to our Risk Committee at least twice a year, 
including at least one joint meeting with the Audit and 
Compliance Committee. The full Board and committees all 
receive ad hoc updates as needed and the Risk Committee 
annually approves the company’s Information Security 
Program. Learn more in our 2022 Proxy Statement. 

Our Data Protection and Privacy Principles governs the way  
we collect, use, store, share, transmit, delete, or otherwise 
process our customer and colleague personal data globally. 

As we innovate in fast-developing areas such as artificial 
intelligence and machine learning, our Global Risk and 
Compliance Team oversees policies and processes that are 
designed to enable us to adopt these technologies responsibly 
and ethically.

Training

Every colleague at American Express is accountable for how  
we protect and manage personal data about our customers, 
prospects, and colleagues. We educate our colleagues about  
our Data Protection and Privacy Principles through our Code  
of Conduct and mandatory annual information security and 
privacy training across our global operations. We also run 
simulations that test our colleagues’ ability to detect and 
respond to suspicious activity.

Learn more about our commitment to data protection and privacy  
in Protecting Our Customers.

To address global ESG issues that affect  
us and our industry, like data privacy and 
security, we engage with our partners and 
peers through industry groups, roundtables, 
conferences, and other forums. For example, 
in 2021 we engaged in forums with the Data  
& Trust Alliance, the Centre for Information 
Policy Leadership, the Future of Privacy 
Forum, the Bank Policy Institute, and the 
Business Roundtable.

RISK MANAGEMENT

From cybersecurity threats to changes in the 
geopolitical landscape, risks to our business 
and operations are evolving and complex.

We follow the “three lines of defense” 
approach to risk management:

• The first line owns and manages risks and 
functions directly to initiate risk decision 
activities.

• The second line functions independently  

to monitor and oversee first line risk 
management activities.

• The third line, which consists of the  

Internal Audit Group, provides independent 
assurance that the first and second lines  
of defense operate effectively.

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) at 
American Express identifies, aggregates, 
monitors, and reports all risks and  
establishes the Company’s risk appetite  
and risk governance processes, culture, and 
capabilities. Our Chief Risk Officer oversees 
risks and risk management activities across 
the Company and chairs the Enterprise  
Risk Management Committee (ERMC),  
which oversees the Company’s governance 
approach to all risks. As part of its remit, the 

ERMC monitors compliance with risk appetite 
limits, escalations, and resolution activities  
to provide awareness of changes in the risk 
profile and drives continuous improvement  
of risk management processes and controls. 
The ERMC also reviews key risk exposures, 
trends, and concentrations and significant 
compliance issues and provides guidance  
on the steps to monitor, control, and report 
major risks. Our Board monitors our “tone  
at the top” and risk culture and oversees 
emerging strategic risks around the world.

tested Business Continuity Plans, along with the 
tools, training, and guidance.  

Across our global supply chain, we assess the 
resiliency of key third-party service providers 
and require vendors that provide business 
critical services to maintain Business Continuity 
Plans. Colleagues who manage these vendors 
ensure that both Business Continuity Plans as 
well as potential Exit Plans are in place should 
they be needed, including a list of alternative 
suppliers and/or a strategy to bring the 
products and services in-house if necessary.  

For more information on Board and management 
risk oversight, see our 2022 Proxy Statement.

operations and supporting technology in the 
event of an unplanned disruption. We support

INCORPORATING  
ESG INTO  
ENTERPRISE RISK 
MANAGEMENT

How will climate change impact our 
operations and business as we transition 
to a low-carbon economy? In 2020 and 
2021, we conducted a qualitative climate 
risk scenario analysis aligned with the 
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) framework to assess 
physical and transition risks and 
opportunities to our business related to 
climate change. 

ESG risks—in particular climate risk—
have been included as an emerging risk 
for the company, and are part of our 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
framework. Climate-related risks are 
currently managed as part of our ERM 
process. The Risk Committee of our 
Board of Directors provides oversight  
of our ERM framework, processes,  
and methodologies, and approves our 
Enterprise Risk Management policy, which 
governs risk governance, risk oversight, 
and risk appetite.

RESPONSIBLE SOURCING THROUGHOUT 
THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN 

We seek to provide the world’s best customer experience 
including by relying on services provided by thousands of 
suppliers worldwide. We manage these vendors through our 
Global Supply Management team, with a focus on meeting 
regulatory requirements, managing risk across our global 
relationships, and enhancing product and service offerings.  
In selecting and managing suppliers, we use appropriate  
due diligence and contracting requirements depending on  
the relationship.

Whenever possible, our Global Supply Management team 
seeks to work with suppliers from its Approved Supplier  
List, which consists of businesses that have successfully 
completed our risk assessment process. This process covers 
screening suppliers that trigger key risks including human 
rights, anti-corruption, data protection, and privacy protection.

As part of our DE&I Action Plan, we have a goal to double our 
annual spend with underrepresented-owned suppliers in the 
US from a 2019 baseline to $750 million by the end of 2024. 
This includes increasing spend with Black-owned suppliers to 
at least $100 million annually. 

Learn more in Raising the Bar for Supply Chain Diversity. 

“ Delivering products and services in a fair and 
transparent manner is critical to the best-in-
class customer service that we provide.”

– AMERICAN EXPRESS HUMAN RIGHTS STATEMENT

Our Reconciliation Action Plan in Australia is another 
example of our focus on responsible procurement. This 
action plan not only reflects, celebrates, and supports the 
role that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples play  
in the country, it also communicates our desire to work with 
suppliers who share the same values related to supplier 
diversity, ethical sourcing, operating responsibly (including 
environmental sustainability), human rights, gender equality, 
and ending modern slavery.

We guard against incidents of modern slavery and human 
trafficking within our business and supply chain by working 
with suppliers who share our values.

Transparency Statement, and Australia Modern Slavery Statement

PRIORITIZING COLLEAGUES’ HEALTH, SAFETY,  
AND WELL-BEING

Through our award-winning health and mental well-being 
program, Healthy Living and Healthy Minds, we provide holistic 
benefits and maintain company policies that promote wellness.

Caring for Our Caregiver Colleagues 

Since the pandemic began, 
many of our colleagues took 
greater roles in caregiving for 
children, parents, and other 
loved ones. We have helped 
them manage work and life 
through programs like Amex 
Flex and a growing suite of 
resources, including access to 
BumoBrain Virtual Learning and 
Bright Horizons World at Home 

to help keep children engaged and learning, discounted access 
to tutoring, remote sessions on caregiving, and more. 

“ As the Executive Sponsor of Families@Amex 
colleague network, and as a devoted son to 
two parents in their 90s, I know firsthand 
what a labor of love caregiving can be. While 
there are a range of emotions that come with 
caring for aging parents, I consider it the 
greatest gift to be able to support and care 
for the people who have given the world to 
me and my family and provided guidance 
and support. So many colleagues play critical 
roles in the day-to-day lives of their loved 
ones. I’d encourage all caregivers to lean into 
the backing, benefits, and community we 
have at Amex—it’s here for you in good and 
challenging times.”

CONNECTIONS WITH OUR 
COMMUNITIES

Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, we kept our 
colleagues connected to volunteer opportunities that 
benefited both their mental health and communities

for example, supported 14 nonprofit organizations, 
engaging over 80 colleagues who donated 830  
volunteer hours.

RESPONSIBLE LENDING

American Express is committed to responsible lending. We aim to accommodate our 
customers’ spending needs while providing appropriate lending capacity, with a strong 
focus on managing risk.

No single factor determines our credit decisions. For 
consumer accounts, we look at credit payment history, 
reported income, overall debt level compared to financial 
resources, and credit bureau scores. For commercial clients, 
we consider a company’s size, financial information, and 
available reports from commercial bureaus, as well as 
information from consumer credit bureaus for our small 
business accounts. Our underwriting processes help us 
manage both our own credit exposure and our customers’ 
potential risk. 

We offer a variety of financial relief options, including a 
temporarily lowered annual percentage rate (APR) on our 
cards, waived fees, and other accommodations for customers 
enrolled in our financial relief program. In 2020, we created a 
Customer Pandemic Relief Program providing short-term 
support for customers impacted by COVID-19. We also 

enhanced and expanded our Financial Relief Program to 
provide assistance to customers in multiple countries. We  
may also refer Card Members to nonprofit credit counseling 
services as needed.

We seek to be transparent and fair in our customer practices 
throughout the credit lifecycle. We regularly review marketing 
offers and credit decisions and investigate the root causes  
of customer complaints. When complaints require customer 
remediation, we follow an issue management process that  
is designed to deliver corrective actions and appropriate 
redress. We also conduct regular colleague training on 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations throughout 
the credit lifecycle—including marketing, underwriting, and 
collections activities—and track completion rates. In the  
United States, training includes the Equal Credit Opportunity 
Act and Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

As of December 31, 2021, a majority of the investment 
securities on the American Express Consolidated Balance 
Sheets represented US Treasuries backed by the federal 
government. We are also actively backing and collaborating 
with new businesses through our corporate venture group. 
Since 2011, American Express Ventures has invested in  
and partnered with startups to accelerate innovation for 
consumers and businesses. To date, we have backed more  
than 80 startups who are enhancing our own enterprise 
capabilities and shaping the future of commerce, payments, 
fraud prevention, data analytics, and security.

OUR COMMITMENT TO ESG

Our priority ESG issues

American Express prioritizes our ESG issues 
based on their relative importance to our 
business and to our stakeholders.

We updated our priority ESG issues in  
2020 by completing a comprehensive ESG 
materiality analysis. We collaborated with  
the think tank and advisory firm SustainAbility 
to guide our approach and we used the 
following methodology: 

1.  Current State Assessment: We conducted 
internal business research and external 
benchmarking to identify the most  
relevant ESG issues to our key stakeholders, 
industry, and company. As part of this 
process, we utilized an ESG big data  
software platform to review and integrate 
thousands of peer documents, regulations, 
and other relevant data points. Additionally, 
we evaluated leading ESG frameworks, 
including the Sustainable Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB), Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI), the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), the Task Force on Climate-

related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and 
more to inform our assessment. Outputs 
from the analysis were then considered to 
create a preliminary list of ESG issues.

3. ESG Issues Prioritization: Using outputs from our business analysis, benchmarking, and 
stakeholder engagement activities, we ranked our 20 priority ESG issues based on their relative 
importance to our business and their relative importance to our stakeholders. The following  
matrix highlights these results: 

2.  Stakeholder Input: We utilized findings  
from our assessment to help guide our 
approach to collecting stakeholder input. 
Our third-party consultants interviewed 
more than 30 internal and external 
stakeholders, including the Chairman and 
CEO, all Executive Committee members, 
shareholders, customers, strategic  
partners, suppliers, nonprofit organizations, 
and others. We also conducted an ESG 
colleague survey across 16 business units 
worldwide. Further, we compiled and 
synthesized other ESG-related feedback 
received from stakeholders as part of  
our ongoing engagement process. Finally, 
we conducted an analysis of evolving 
expectations resulting from the global 
pandemic and its related impacts on our 
priority ESG issues.

Engaging our stakeholders in ESG efforts

Our ESG commitment starts with our stakeholders: 
shareholders, colleagues, customers, community 
organizations, and more. To better understand the ESG issues 
that matter most to them and advance our efforts to operate 
responsibly, we regularly engage with our stakeholders 
through a variety of channels.

Our leaders collect ongoing colleague feedback through our  
annual Colleague Experience Survey, as well as open Q&A  
sessions and our Colleague Networks. 

We engage with our Card Members, businesses, and 
merchants through customer service, direct-to-customer 
channels, and social media. We regularly meet with our key 
suppliers to ensure they understand current business 
strategies and measures of success to meet regulatory and 
company requirements. Our Lead Independent Director who 
also serves as our Compensation and Benefits Committee 
Chair is available for engagement with shareholders, including 
participating in joint corporate governance and investor 
relations meetings. We deliver feedback to our Board 
regarding shareholder meetings.

To address global ESG issues that affect us and our industry,  
we engage with our partners and peers through industry 
groups, roundtables, conferences, and other forums. For 
example, in 2021, we engaged in forums with the Data & Trust 
Alliance, the Centre for Information Policy Leadership, the 
Future of Privacy Forum, the Bank Policy Institute, and the 
Business Roundtable. 

We regularly engage our key stakeholders to better understand the ESG issues that matter most to them and our business.  
Their feedback informed our priority issues assessment and ESG strategy framework. Our engagement with the following eight 
stakeholder groups helps us to understand and meet their expectations and advance our efforts to operate responsibly. 

Stakeholder Group

How We Engage 

Shareholders 

Colleagues

We provide the investment community with information on our strategy, objectives, and performance on  
the American Express Investor Relations website. Following our 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, we  
met with shareholders representing approximately 45% of our outstanding shares and other constituents  
to discuss executive compensation, corporate governance, ESG, and related matters. To foster direct 
communication between shareholders and our Board, our Lead Independent Director is available for 
engagement with shareholders. 

We keep colleagues updated on company news, priorities, performance, and business strategies through  
a variety of channels. Our leaders collect ongoing colleague feedback through our annual Colleague 
Experience Survey, open Q&A sessions, Colleague Networks, and our Amex Ethics Hotline.

Customers: Card Members,  
Businesses, and Merchants

We have direct relationships with millions of Card Members, businesses, and merchants around the world,  
whom we engage through customer service, direct-to-customer channels, and social media. 

Government and Regulators

We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world.  
We advocate for public policy issues that are significant to our business and our ability to serve our customers  
by providing education and context to government decision-makers. 

Suppliers

Community and  
Nonprofit Organizations

We regularly meet with our key suppliers to ensure they understand current business strategies and measures  
of success to meet regulatory and company requirements. 

We mobilize thousands of colleagues as volunteers through our Serve2Gether and Green2Gether program  
and offer incentives to support eligible charities through Give2Gether, our gift-matching program. We also 
directly support and collaborate with nonprofits, including through the American Express Foundation,  
and help develop the nonprofit and social purpose leaders of tomorrow through the longstanding  
American Express Leadership Academy. 

ESG Research and Rating Agencies

We respond to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and other ESG surveys and questionnaires  
from rating agencies and indexes including EcoVadis, FTSE4Good, Sustainalytics, MSCI, and others. 

Partners and Peers

OUR ESG GOVERNANCE AND OPERATING RESPONSIBLY

Key Policies

Anti-Bribery and Corruption

We have a zero-tolerance policy for bribery. All colleagues must complete anti-corruption and bribery training tied to their annual compensation that includes information on applicable laws 
and regulations for their location.

Anti-Money Laundering

Code of Conduct

Our global policy details our approach to preventing money laundering and related financial crimes. Colleagues receive regular training to review our policies and requirements, relevant 
laws, and their role in recognizing and reporting unusual behavior. 

Our Code of Conduct is our manual for informing colleagues of the workplace behaviors we expect. It covers ethical business practices ranging from anti-corruption to technology use, 
conflicts of interest, conducting business with foreign governments, and protecting customer privacy (see pages 67-68, 82-84). 

Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)

We are committed to equal employment opportunities for all individuals. We make hiring decisions based on job-related qualifications and ability to perform the job without regard to race, 
color, religion, sex, national origin, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, genetic information, citizenship, marital status, or any other basis prohibited by law. Our policies prohibit 
harassment of colleagues and contractors by co-workers, supervisors, or outsiders and such behavior may trigger disciplinary action, including loss of employment or contract. We also 
enforce a Global Sexual Harassment Policy Statement. 

Human Rights

We promote human rights and are committed to responsible workplace practices and protecting the human rights of people working throughout our supply chain. Our Human Rights 
Statement and Code of Conduct express our commitment to fair and equal treatment of all people. We guard against incidents of modern slavery and human trafficking within our business 
and supply chain by conducting employment checks and by working with suppliers that meet high standards of conduct (see page 86). See also our UK Modern Slavery Act Transparency 
Statement and Australia Modern Slavery Statement. 

Public Policy Engagement and  
Political Contributions

We believe active engagement in the public policy arena is vital to the democratic process and an important part of responsible corporate citizenship. We are transparent about our policy 
engagement with governments, including through Lobbying Disclosure Act filings. We provide our perspective to officials at various government levels worldwide and collaborate with trade 
and industry associations. For more information, including lobbying requirements and our semiannual reporting of US political contributions, see our Political Contributions Report. 

Responsible Marketing

Our marketing programs go through multiple layers of review across business units so that our customers may be well-informed, in a responsible manner, about our products and services 
(see pages 68-69).

Taxation

We carefully consider our taxation positions so that they are consistent with our overall tax strategy, broader corporate governance requirements, applicable laws, and corporate values.  
We engage with tax authorities globally with openness and integrity to support compliance with our tax obligations. We are a current taxpayer both within and outside of the United States.  
For more information on taxation, see our 2021 Annual Report. 

Whistleblower Claims Policy

Our Whistleblower Claims Policy allows colleagues, contractors, customers, merchants, and others to report allegations in good faith without fear of retaliation or risk to their employment. 
Claims are investigated and recommendations are made by the Colleague Experience Group, Internal Audit Group, and Global Security, in consultation with our General Counsel’s 
Organization, as appropriate.

Transparency and alignment with external reporting frameworks

We use industry-leading standards and frameworks to inform our ESG activities and measure  
our progress. 

We align our disclosures with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which includes 
environmental, economic, and social disclosures, as well as supplemental disclosures for the 
financial services sector. It also includes general disclosures in areas such as our supply chain, 
governance, ethics, and more. In addition, we use the standards of the Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB) to guide the disclosure of sustainability information of 
interest to investors, including topics such as data privacy, data security, business ethics, and 
more. Further, we report annually in alignment with the recommendations of the Task Force on 
Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), including our approach to climate-related 
governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. We also disclose outcomes 
from qualitative climate risk scenario analyses to assess physical and transition risks to our 
business related to climate change. 

You will find our TCFD, SASB, and GRI indexes on the following pages of this report.

2021–2022 TCFD INDEX

American Express Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Index

The Financial Stability Board (FSB), comprised of members of the G20, established the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures. As part of our 
commitment to climate action, American Express reports annually in line with the TCFD recommendations. The table below summarizes our approach to climate-related governance, strategy,  
risk management, and metrics and targets. It also discloses the outcomes from the qualitative climate risk scenario analyses we performed in 2020 and 2021 to assess physical and transition  
risks to our business related to climate change. In 2021, we became a formal TCFD Supporter, joining over 3,000 organizations taking action to build a more resilient financial system through 
transparent climate-related disclosure. For more information, refer to the Advancing Climate Solutions and Our ESG Governance and Operating Responsibly sections of the 2021-2022 ESG Report, 
2021 Annual Report, 2022 Proxy, and 2021 CDP Climate Change Response.

TCFD Recommendation

Disclosure

1. Governance

1a.  Describe the board’s 
oversight of climate- 
related risks and 
opportunities

Risk management is overseen by the American Express Board of Directors through three Board Committees: The Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation 
and Benefits Committee. The committees meet regularly with the company’s Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Chief Audit Executive, the Chief Operational Risk Officer, 
and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, controls, talent, and capabilities. The Board monitors the “tone at the top,” our risk culture, and oversees emerging 
and strategic risks.

The Risk Committee provides oversight of the company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, processes, and methodologies, and approves the company’s ERM policy, which governs 
risk governance, risk oversight, and risk appetite. ESG and climate-related risks are currently identified as an “emerging risk” within our ERM framework.  

In addition, the Board’s Nominating, Governance, and Public Responsibility Committee (NGPRC) reviews the company’s ESG strategy and Corporate Sustainability program, monitors progress 
against ESG goals, and provides guidance on our efforts. The Chief Corporate Affairs Officer (CCAO), who sits on our Executive Committee, and the Vice President of Corporate Sustainability 
updates the NGPRC on ESG-related issues, progress, and performance at least twice annually.

1b.  Describe 

management’s role  
in assessing and 
managing climate-
related risks and 
opportunities

The company’s Executive Committee reviews and evaluates ESG performance and long-term goals. Our CCAO is on the Executive Committee and reports directly to the Chairman and Chief  
Executive Officer (CEO). The CCAO oversees the Corporate Affairs & Communications (CA&C) Department and has direct responsibility for leading ESG and Corporate Sustainability initiatives, 
supported by the Corporate Sustainability and ESG Team. 

The Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer, is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk 
governance, risk oversight, and risk appetite, including the management of ESG and climate risks. Furthermore, a dedicated group associated with climate risk, with direct accountability to the  
ERMC, has been established.

2. Strategy

2a.  Describe the climate-
related risks and 
opportunities the 
organization has 
identified over the 
short-, medium-,  
and long-term

The ESG Steering Committee, chaired by our CCAO, guides our ESG strategy and related policies and programs. The cross-functional team includes senior executives from across the organization 
including CA&C, Finance, Controllership, General Counsel’s Organization, Government Affairs, American Express National Bank (AENB), Global Real Estate and Workplace Experience, Investor Relations, 
Global Risk and Compliance, and others that meet at least quarterly to discuss ESG topics, strategies, and initiatives to advance our ESG goals. The ESG Steering Committee is supported by ESG 
Working Groups and focuses on our three ESG pillars, including Advance Climate Solutions, which develops strategies to achieve our climate goals. An additional working group focuses on ESG disclosures. 

The Corporate Sustainability and ESG team, led by the VP of Corporate Sustainability, within CA&C is responsible for coordination of climate-related issues across the company. The team works 
closely with business units to monitor climate-related issues and opportunities, carbon reduction efforts, energy efficiency initiatives, low-carbon product innovations, colleague engagement, and 
other initiatives in alignment with our ESG Strategy.

Executive compensation is also increasingly linked to our ESG goals. For example, in prior years, the Company’s annual scorecard’s Colleague category included diversity representation, talent 
retention, culture, and inclusion metrics as part of the calculation to determine incentive compensation for all eligible colleagues, and in 2021, we also incorporated the management of key ESG 
priorities, including metrics, into our executive compensation program under the Strategic category of our annual scorecard. 

American Express takes a strategic approach to managing the impacts of climate change, considering the risks and opportunities across the short-term (0–3 years), medium-term (3–6 years), 
and long-term (6–10+ years). In 2020 and 2021, we conducted qualitative analyses of current and potential climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities to our operations, supply 
chain, and business activities.

Physical Risks: The qualitative climate-related physical risk assessment performed in 2020 evaluated potential acute and chronic risks and opportunities associated with the physical impacts of 
climate change on key operations across several time horizons including historic conditions (1990–2018) and medium-term (2035) and long-term (2060) projections. The potential physical risks 
include flooding due to sea level rise and extreme precipitation, cyclonic storm threats, drought, and extreme temperatures across the some of our critical sites. These threats could affect 
operations at our global headquarters, data centers, call centers, offices, and third-party supplier card manufacturing sites. 

Transition Risks: The qualitative climate-related transition risk assessment evaluated three scenarios from the International Energy Agency (IEA) to analyze the impact of transition risks on our company’s 
potential future revenues and costs between 2025 and 2040. We assessed transition risks and opportunities associated with current and emerging regulations, technology advances to transition to a  
low-carbon future, and public demand and reputational risks. We identified potential short-, medium-, and long-term risks including current regulations and carbon pricing; emerging regulations related to 
enhanced emissions reporting requirements; shifting consumer preferences; reputational risks; increased operating costs; impacts to travel patterns; and geographic or location-based risks.

We identified climate-related opportunities in the short, medium, and long term that may have financial or strategic impacts on our business. Opportunities include maintaining carbon neutrality,  
continuing to invest in energy efficiency projects, onsite renewable electricity generation, renewable Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs), and carbon offsets. Across our value chain, climate-related 
opportunities exist through innovation and investments in research and development for low-carbon products and services. In addition, we have a goal to pilot low-carbon innovations by the end of 2022, 
including carbon tracking and offset solutions for customers.

2b.  Describe the impact 
of climate-related 
risks and opportunities 
on the organization’s 
businesses, strategy, 
and financial planning

Climate-related risks and opportunities inform our business, strategy, and financial planning across our direct operations, products and services, funding, and supply chain. The Advance Climate 
Solutions pillar of our ESG Strategy includes goals to enhance the management of climate-related risks and opportunities across our business, commit to net-zero emissions by 2035 in alignment 
with the Science Based Targets initiative, and pilot low-carbon product innovations by the end of 2022.

Our strategy has been influenced by climate-related physical and transition risks over the short-, medium-, and long-term, including those associated with emerging regulations and acute and  
chronic physical risks. 

Operations: Climate-related opportunities across our operations include reducing operating costs and environmental impacts at our global facilities by improving energy, water, and resource 
efficiency, and leveraging climate policies and tax incentives to expand onsite renewable energy. We have been a carbon neutral company powered by 100% renewable electricity across our global 
operations since 20181 through onsite solar, renewable energy credits, carbon offsets, reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and achieved green building certification across 56% of our 
operations.2 These investments and initiatives are factored into our annual financial planning processes.

Products & Services: To respond to changes in consumer preferences, we invest in research and development to develop and enhance our products and services. One of our Advance Climate 
Solutions objectives is to enable our customers and partners to transition to a low-carbon economy through the development of new capabilities, supported by a goal to pilot low-carbon product 
innovations, including carbon tracking and offset solutions, by the end of 2022. 

In 2019, we launched the first American Express Card made primarily from reclaimed plastic collected from oceans and coasts, which reduces GHG emissions and energy and water  
consumption during manufacturing compared to virgin plastic. We also introduced a Card Take Back Program, which enables US Card Members to send back expired or non-working cards to 
American Express for recycling. We have recycled more than 1.3 million cards since 2019, including cards returned by Card Members. In 2022, we set a goal for the vast majority of plastic cards 
issued by American Express to be made of at least 70% recycled or reclaimed plastic by the end of 2024, which can help avoid nearly 160,000 pounds of virgin plastic from being used annually. 

For our Corporate clients, our Carbon Footprint Dashboard is available to over 1,000 global corporate clients to help track estimated carbon emissions associated with their employees’ air travel. 
We are expanding this tool to include additional categories of spend—including ground transportation, hotel stays, restaurants, and retail—letting corporate clients better understand behaviors so 
they can find opportunities to manage carbon emissions.3 In 2022, we launched a Carbon Offset Referral Suite that provides US corporate clients with a curated list of carbon offset providers who 
can help them manage their footprint via offset solutions that include investments in large-scale carbon removal and reduction projects and avoidance projects.

Funding: In May 2022, American Express closed our first-ever ESG bond issuance. An amount equivalent to the net proceeds of the $1 billion ESG bond will be allocated toward projects in the 
Green and Social Categories, informed by the American Express Sustainable Financing Framework. Green projects include those related to green buildings, energy efficiency improvements and 
renewable energy, and the circular economy. Social projects include initiatives connected to socioeconomic advancement and empowerment, access to essential services, and affordable housing. 

1.   Achieved carbon neutral operations for Scope 1 (direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by American Express), Scope 2 (indirect market-based emissions), and Scope 3 (waste and employee business travel, including third-party air, rail, and rental cars) emissions through renewable energy credits, 
carbon offsets, and reduced GHG emissions. Operations include all our managed facilities, field sites, and data centers. Managed facilities are individual properties operationally managed by our global real estate team and housing critical business functions. Field sites are individual properties that are not 
operationally managed by our global real estate team but directly by our business units. They are typically smaller sites, less than 30,000 square feet (including airport lounges, foreign exchange kiosks, and sales offices) that are owned or leased by American Express.

2.  Green building certified percentage is represented by the total year-end square footage certified out of total year-end building square footage. This includes leased or owned facilities actively occupied by American Express (excluding parking lot square footage) that have achieved certification under a global or 

locally recognized third-party environmental building certification system as meeting their performance criteria (LEED, BREEAM, NABERS, GreenMark, HQE, and Effinergie+).

3.  American Express’ Carbon Footprint Tool calculations are derived by applying selected conversion factors to spending made with the following American Express Corporate products: Corporate Card, Business Travel Account, Corporate Meeting Card, Corporate Purchasing Card, Buyer Initiated Payments,  

vPayments and Amex Go. The estimated information provided by the Carbon Footprint Tool is for generalized informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, tax, accounting, legal or other professional advice on any subject matter.

Our ESG governance framework, Advance Climate Solutions pillar of our ESG strategy, and qualitative climate risk scenario analyses demonstrate our progress to enhance climate risk management 
and opportunities across our business. We committed to net-zero by 2035 in alignment with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and selected this goal based on SBTi’s most ambitious level of 
climate action, to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. We leverage science-based frameworks including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and International 
Energy Agency (IEA), to inform our climate-related risk identification process across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons.

We aim to minimize our climate impact and manage our climate-related risks and opportunities; enable our customers and partners to transition to a low-carbon economy through the development 
of new capabilities; and support community programs and initiatives to help build more climate resilient and equitable communities. 

For our qualitative climate-related physical risk assessment, we evaluated potential threats and mitigation opportunities to critical business sites across our global operations, supply chain,  
and revenue sources both under historic conditions and applied to future climate projections from the IPCC’s Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. Each site was examined 
for seven potential acute and chronic risks from the physical impacts of climate change: 1) increasing temperatures; 2) sea level rise; 3) precipitation changes; 4) flooding; 5) cyclonic events;  
6) extended drought; and 7) extreme temperatures. For the qualitative climate-related transition risk assessment, we evaluated the impact of three future scenarios from the IEA compatible with  
a 1.5°C, 2-3°C, 6°C pathway on countries essential to our business operations against 2025- and 2040-time horizons. The assessment evaluated the impact of transition risks to our potential 
future revenues and costs associated with capital expenditures and capital allocation strategies over short- and long-term horizons. 

American Express management establishes risk management policies and procedures to identify, assess, measure, and manage key risks facing the company. ESG risks, including, but not limited 
to, climate change risk are currently identified as an “emerging risk” within our risk governance framework. 

We define climate-related risks as:

1. 

2. 

Transition Risks: Risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may include extensive changes pertaining to policy, legal, technology, market, and reputational risks 

 Physical Risks: Risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, typically driven by acute physical risk such as increased severity of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, 
hurricanes, floods) and chronic physical risks which are longer-term shifts in climate patterns (e.g., sea level rise, chronic heat waves) 

Climate-related risks are interconnected and overarching across all risk types as it may manifest as credit risk, operational risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and other risk types.  

To identify and assess climate-related risks, we conducted qualitative climate-related physical and transition risk and opportunity assessments to understand the current and potential impacts of 
climate change to our direct business operations, supply chain, and financial activities. We also consider current and emerging climate regulations, technology, legal, and reputational risks and 
qualitative factors such as disruptions to our operations, impacts on our colleagues, and damage to our brand.

3b.   Describe the 

organization’s 
processes for 
managing climate-
related risks

ESG and climate-related risks are managed as part of our comprehensive ERM program. Risk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through its Risk Committee, Audit and Compliance 
Committee, and Compensation and Benefits Committee, each of which provide regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed by these committees. These committees meet regularly 
with our Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, the Chief Audit Executive, Chief Operational Risk Officer, and other senior management with regards to our risk management 
processes, controls, talent, and capabilities to monitor our risk culture and emerging and strategic risks. 

The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC) provides oversight of our Enterprise Risk Management framework, processes, and 
methodologies, and approves our Enterprise Risk Management policy, which governs risk governance, risk oversight, and risk appetite. 

ESG risks—in particular climate risk—have been included as an emerging risk for the company and are part of our Enterprise Risk Management scope. A dedicated group associated with climate 
risk, with direct accountability to the ERMC, has been established.

Additionally, the Nominating, Governance, and Public Responsibility Committee (NGPRC) of the Board has oversight of ESG matters including climate-related issues. The ESG Steering Committee, 
comprised of senior leaders across the organization, and Advance Climate Solutions Working Group consider climate-related risks in connection with developing climate-related goals and  
operational strategies. 

In 2020, we completed a comprehensive assessment to identify priority environmental, social, and governance issues for our business with input from internal and external stakeholders. As a 
result of this process, we ranked 20 priority ESG issues based on their relative importance to our business and to our stakeholders. Key issues identified included climate change, energy, and GHG 
emissions, data privacy and security, financial resiliency, business ethics, responsible travel and consumption, inclusion and diversity, and colleague attraction and retention.

 3c.  Describe how 
processes for 
identifying, assessing, 
and managing 
climate-related risks 
are integrated into 
the organization’s 
overall risk 
management

We have a comprehensive ERM program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture, and capabilities. ESG and climate-
related risks are currently identified as an “emerging risk” within our risk governance framework. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer.  
The ERMC, chaired by our Chief Risk Officer, is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight, and risk appetite.  
The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control, and report major risks. ERMC has also 
approved the formation of the Climate Risk Management Working Group, composed of cross-functional representation with direct oversight specifically to address evolving regulatory expectations 
on management of climate-related financial risks. 

In addition, the Asset Liability Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for managing our capital, funding and liquidity, investment, market risk, and asset/liability activities 
in accordance with our policies and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.

The ESG Steering Committee, comprised of senior leadership, discuss ESG topics and climate-related risks, opportunities, and strategies to advance our ESG goals. 

Transition risks and opportunities, including current and emerging regulations, disclosure requirements, legal and reputational risks, and customer requirements are considered by teams including 
Global Real Estate and Workplace Experience, Global Risk and Compliance, General Counsel’s Organization, Finance, Technology, CA&C, Corporate Sustainability, and ESG Teams. 

Physical risks and opportunities, including extreme weather events and natural disasters, are identified and measured for severity as part of our business continuity planning and primarily overseen 
by our Global Real Estate and Workplace Experience and Technology Teams. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans are developed and updated regularly to ensure steps are in place to 
identify and respond before, during, and after a service continuity event. Our facility and data center teams review these established procedures and controls, test them annually, and certify key 
equipment and systems operations to ensure uninterrupted operation of our data centers during localized weather events. Our facility infrastructure is monitored 24/7 and test results are tracked 
and reported. Our US-based data center facilities are ISO-certified to ensure that environmental risks and/or opportunities are identified and prioritized.

used by the organization 
to assess climate-related 
risks and opportunities 
in line with its strategy 
and risk management 
process

4b.  Disclose Scope 1, Scope 
2, and, if appropriate, 
Scope 3 greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, and

American Express tracks metrics to evaluate climate-related risks and opportunities including total GHG emissions, energy and water consumption, purchased and onsite renewable electricity, 
waste, and green building certifications. For a historical view of our metrics, see the Environmental Performance Data Summary section of our 2021–2022 ESG Report. 

We track and disclose our Scope 1, 2, and 3 (Category 5 - Waste and Category 6 - Business Travel) GHG emissions annually. Emissions are calculated in alignment with the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol and third-party verified using the ISO14064-3 standard. Since 2018, we have been certified by CarbonNeutral®, a leading third-party framework, and powered by 100% renewable 
electricity across our global operations.1 To maintain carbon neutrality, we continue to implement energy efficiency measures, purchase renewable EACs, carbon offsets, and have onsite solar 
panels at our data center in North Carolina and our office in the United Kingdom. 

For more information on our GHG emissions data for 2021, 2020, and 2019, refer to the Environmental Performance Data Summary on pages 96-99.

Achieved carbon neutral operations for Scope 1 (direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by American Express), Scope 2 (indirect and market-based emissions), and Scope 3 (waste and employee business travel, including third-party air, rail, and rental cars) emissions through renewable energy credits, 

carbon offsets, and reduced GHG emissions. Operations include all our managed facilities, field sites, and data centers). Managed facilities are individual properties operationally managed by our global real estate team and housing critical business functions. Field sites are individual properties that are not 
operationally managed by our global real estate team but directly by our business units. They are typically smaller sites, less than 30,000 square feet (including airport lounges, foreign exchange kiosks, and sales offices) that are owned or leased by American Express.

In 2021, we provided $20 million to the Accion Opportunity Fund, a nonprofit Community Development Financial Institution and 
small business lender to expand access to loans for historically underfunded small businesses in the United States, including 
those owned by underrepresented groups. 

American Express engages in programs designed to support small businesses and community development. In 2021, the  
American Express Center for Community Development underwrote $265 million in investments, loans, and grants to support 
small business needs, job creation and retention, and affordable housing, including the development of 1,947 units for families in 
need.  Additionally, through our Backing Small Initiative we provide financial support and resources to economically vulnerable 
small business owners.

American Express is built on trust, integrity, and service excellence.

Living up to this legacy means doing what is right for our colleagues, customers, and communities.

Our strength comes from the impact we can make on people’s lives or what we call the powerful backing of American Express and our ESG strategy is a natural extension of this.

The myriad of challenges facing the world today, many unprecedented in our lifetime, underscore the importance of our powerful backing promise.

We are now over two years into navigating the pandemic the effects of climate change are more apparent than ever macroeconomic and geopolitical instability is on the rise and, just in the last few months, we have witnessed the war in Ukraine unfold into a devastating humanitarian crisis.

Against this backdrop, we continue to back our colleagues, customers, and communities to drive positive impact.

Our strength comes from the impact we can make on people’s lives or what we call the powerful backing of American Express and our ESG strategy is a natural extension of this.

As the way we live and work has evolved with the pandemic, we have been focused on creating a new work model that supports our colleagues.

In March 2022, we officially launched Amex Flex, our new way of working that provides colleagues with the flexibility to work full time in the office, fully virtually, or a hybrid of both.

Amex Flex is designed to recapture the creativity and collaboration of working together in person, while also retaining the agility and productivity we were able to achieve in a virtual environment during the pandemic.

This approach also enables us to broaden the talent pool we can attract and strengthen retention as we provide colleagues with a compelling value proposition that offers choice, leading benefits, competitive compensation, and opportunities for growth and career advancement.

Our colleagues are critical to our success, and they are the driving force behind the impact we make in people’s lives and in the communities we serve.

I am exceptionally proud of what we achieved to date on our ESG strategy, thanks to the dedication of our colleagues around the world who bring our company’s purpose to life.

Advancing Our ESG Priorities We announced our ESG framework in 2020, centered around three core priorities: Promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE I) Advance Climate Solutions and Build Financial Confidence.

Since then, we have solidified our strategy by developing a clear roadmap to translate our objectives into action.

We are continuing to strengthen our culture of inclusion and belonging across the company and providing transparency into our efforts.

In 2021, we published our inaugural DE I Report, which included detailed disclosures on diversity representation among colleagues and our ongoing efforts to maintain a diverse and equitable workplace through inclusive hiring, career growth, retention, and equal pay practices.

In addition to sharing our progress across these areas in 2021, in this report we have included additional details related to representation of our ethnically and racially diverse colleagues in the US.

We also exceeded 1 billion in spending toward our DE I Action Plan announced in October 2020.

The plan supported our efforts to increase spending with underrepresented owned suppliers, expanding access to capital and financial education and partnering with nonprofit organizations focused on promoting equality, among other initiatives.

To build on this momentum, I am pleased to announce an additional 3 billion which means we now aim to spend 4 billion in total from late 2020 through 2025 toward our DE I Action Plan and initiatives globally.

The majority of additional spending will continue to be allocated with suppliers.

We are focused on advancing solutions that address the climate crisis by minimizing our carbon footprint and helping our customers and communities do the same.

Last year marked an important step forward for us, as we committed to net zero emissions by 2035, in alignment with the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), building on our CarbonNeutral operations powered by 100% renewable electricity since 2018.

To reduce our environmental impact across our global real estate portfolio, we have spent more than 150 million since 2019 on the development of facilities that have received green building certification.

In addition to these investments, we have a goal to provide at least 10 million toward philanthropic efforts for climate action as part of our new community giving category: Backing Low Carbon Communities.

We have already pledged over 3 million in grants to support climate and nature based solutions.

Last November, at the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26), we joined the World Economic Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition and Global Future Council on Sustainable Tourism to help promote sustainable travel practices.

In addition, during Earth Month 2022, we announced several new low carbon solutions in line with our 2022 goal.

We also announced a goal of having the vast majority of plastic cards issued by American Express made of at least 70% recycled or reclaimed plastic by the end of 2024.

We have already begun expanding our offerings to integrate recycled plastic into our cards worldwide, starting with Canada and France.

Rooted in our company’s purpose is helping people achieve their aspirations, not only through our differentiated products and services, but also through our investments to strengthen the financial well being, security, and resilience of our communities.

As a longstanding champion of small businesses, we continue to support business owners globally as they navigate new challenges from inflation, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages, in addition to the ongoing impacts from the pandemic.

Our Shop Small campaign is foundational to these efforts.

Since 2020, we spent more than 300 million toward campaign initiatives to help jumpstart spending at small businesses.

In November 2021, we held our 12th annual Small Business Saturday event, which reached an all time high of 23.3 billion in estimated consumer spending at small businesses in the US.1 Consumers reported spending an estimated 598 million at small businesses in the UK on Small Business Saturday held on December 4, 2021,2 and both campaigns contributed toward our goal to drive 100 billion in consumer spending at small businesses through 2025.

We also launched a new community giving category for building financial confidence, Backing Small, which supports small businesses by bringing together all our grant programs focused on supporting small business.

We have already pledged 17 million to support Backing Small programs, including Inclusive Backing, in partnership with Main Street America, focused on underrepresented and economically vulnerable business owners, and the second year of our Backing Historic Small Restaurants program across the US in 2022.

Our new Backing International Small Restaurants program with the International Downtown Association is expanding our support beyond the US by helping culturally significant, independent restaurants operated by underserved populations and those in economic need in five major cities: London, Mexico City, Sydney, Tokyo, and Toronto.

We also deepened our focus on financial literacy, training, and mentoring programs for individuals and business owners through our community giving.

Building on our longstanding partnership with Junior Achievement, we plan to offer bespoke financial literacy education and programs to more than 5,000 students in 11 countries, focusing on underrepresented and underserved communities, through JA Worldwide.

The American Express 2021 Small Business Saturday Consumer Insights Survey was conducted by Teneo on behalf of American Express and the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB).

The study is a nationally representative sample of 2,426 U.S. adults 18 years of age or older.

The sample was collected using an email invitation and an online survey.

The study gathered self reported data and does not reflect actual receipts or sales.

It was conducted anonymously on November 28, 2021.

The survey has an overall margin of error of 2.0%, at the 95% level of confidence.

Projections are based on the current U.S. Census estimates of the U.S. adult population, age 18 years and over.

In May 2022, we issued our inaugural 1 billion ESG Bond, which we will use to finance new and existing Green and Social projects.

This is our first ever financing instrument dedicated to support our ESG strategy and will serve to advance our programs and promote ESG related investments.

In addition to progressing on our ESG goals, we have been focused on the governance and disclosures around our ESG strategy and programs.

In 2022, we incorporated ESG risks, including climate related risks, as an emerging risk for the Company within our Enterprise Risk Management framework.

To help manage our climate related risks, in 2021, we became a formal supporter of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and assessed physical and transition risks to our business in alignment with the TCFD recommendations.

Over the last two years we have created more opportunities to collaborate and innovate across the enterprise and we have done a significant amount of work to define our ESG priorities and objectives.

We also established measurable goals and action plans to achieve them as we continue to execute across each of our three ESG pillars.

All of this work has accelerated our progress and put us on a clear path to strengthen our global impact in the coming years.

As we look ahead, we will continue to build on our momentum, putting our ESG strategy into action to back our colleagues, customers, and communities and make a positive impact in people’s lives and the world we live in.

At American Express, our ESG mission is to back people and businesses to thrive and create equitable, resilient, and sustainable communities globally.

We seek to mobilize our business to address pressing global challenges and deliver high impact initiatives to serve our colleagues, customers, and communities.

In 2021, we launched a new roadmap for our global ESG strategy, establishing new long term goals and objectives across three critical areas for our company, stakeholders, and society: Promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE I) Advance Climate Solutions and Build Financial Confidence.

Throughout 2021 and 2022, we made significant progress toward our goals as highlighted throughout this report.

We also continued to enhance the execution of our ESG strategy with our inaugural 1 billion ESG bond issuance to finance new and existing Green and Social projects.

In May 2022, American Express completed its first ever ESG bond offering, maturing in 2029.

We intend that an amount equivalent to the net proceeds of the 1 billion ESG bond will be allocated toward new and or existing eligible projects in the Green and Social categories, as directed by the newly developed American Express Sustainable Financing Framework, which is aligned with the company’s global ESG strategy.

Projects in the Green category include those related to green buildings, energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy, and the circular economy, such as expenditures related to updating American Express Cards to reclaimed or recycled plastics.

Projects in the Social category include socioeconomic advancement and empowerment initiatives, such as expenditures and programs designed to drive economic growth among diverse groups through the procurement of products and services from diverse suppliers and vendors at least 51% owned by members of diverse populations, independently certified through a qualified agency.

Other projects in the Social category include merchant support programs like our Shop Small campaign, financial empowerment programs, including support of the ByBlack platform to verify businesses as majority owned by Black individuals, and community investments such as programs to enhance access to essential services and affordable housing.

All net proceeds from the sustainable financing are expected to be fully allocated to eligible projects within two years of the date of issuance.

Learn more by reading our newly developed American Express Sustainability Financing Framework, which is aligned with our global ESG strategy.

Our ESG strategy also guides our response to global events, including our support for community resilience and equity.

In light of the attacks on the Ukrainian people, we have taken several actions to support our colleagues, customers, and the humanitarian relief efforts in the region.

For example, we teamed up with Hilton to donate up to one million hotel room nights in hotels across Europe to support Ukrainian refugees and first responders who are helping them.

We also enabled our US Consumer, Small Business, and Corporate Card Members who are enrolled in the Membership Rewards program to use their Membership Rewards to support select charities that are providing humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine and affected parts of Europe and matched the dollar value of their contributions made using points with PayPal Giving Fund through June 15, 2022.

We are continuing to match colleague donations through the American Express Match program.

Since creating the American Express Foundation in 1954, we have provided more than 1 billion to charitable causes around the world through the Foundation and our Corporate Giving Program.

In 2021, we provided 38 million in charitable giving globally, including grants from our company, the American Express Foundation, our Center for Community Development, and gift matching programs.

See our 2021 Community Giving Grants List to learn more about our American Express Foundation and company charitable giving in 2021.

We have provided support to our colleagues, customers, and communities over the last two years of the COVID 19 pandemic.

Providing coverage of out of pocket medical and pharmacy costs related to COVID 19 testing and treatment for colleagues enrolled in our US medical plans.

Up to 16 hours of paid time off for obtaining COVID 19 vaccines and boosters.

Partnering with departments of health and hospitals in the.

US and India to host onsite vaccine clinics for our colleagues, families, and contractors.

We continued to help merchant partners do business while keeping their own customers and staff safe.

For businesses, we raised contactless transaction thresholds to reduce physical contact at points of sale and reminded merchants that we do not require them to collect Card Members’ signatures.

We provided more than 11 million in philanthropic support for COVID 19 relief efforts since the start of the pandemic through 2021, delivering financial support to nonprofits worldwide working on the front lines of the ongoing global crisis.

One of these partners was (RED), which we’ve highlighted below.

Community support during the COVID 19 pandemic has remained a priority.

We provided more than 11 million in philanthropic support for COVID 19 relief efforts since the start of the pandemic through 2021.

In 2021, we joined forces with (RED) to support equitable access to testing, treatment, and vaccines in response to the impact of COVID 19 in the world’s poorest countries.

To shine a spotlight on the campaign, we partnered with (RED) to launch CODE (RED) alongside the reopening of Broadway, with Lin Manuel Miranda joining American Express at a special performance of the hit musical Hamilton.

We provided Card Members with the option to use Membership Rewards points to make donations through PayPal’s Pay with Rewards feature to help provide COVID 19 testing, treatment, and vaccines for people most in need.

We also donated 250,000 to COVID 19 relief efforts championed by (RED) and its partners, Fund for the Global Fund, and COVAX, and matched employee contributions to the campaign.

In March 2022, we officially launched Amex Flex, our new way of working where colleagues can work in the office, at home, or can take a hybrid approach that combines both.

Amex Flex is designed to leverage the best of both in person and remote work and to enable colleagues to have greater flexibility in their personal and professional lives.

Our colleagues remained productive during the pandemic, which required us to become even more agile in how we work, and our new Amex Flex model is designed to continue this trend while leveling the playing field for colleagues across jobs and locations.

In person connections at the office will also continue to play an important role in American Express’ future.

We believe that being together in person has benefits, including spontaneous connections and idea sharing, team bonding and camaraderie, workspaces designed for creativity and collaboration, and more opportunities for mentorship, in person coaching, and networking.

Phasing in Amex Flex and avoiding a one size fits all approach.

Remaining flexible to meet the needs of our colleagues.

Deploying our real estate, technology, and medical teams to help create a welcoming and safe office environment.

Conducting informational and re orientation sessions on topics such as the ongoing health resources we are offering.

Introducing new office technologies to enhance the workplace experience and make it easy to collaborate with colleagues, such as equipping conference and huddle rooms with high definition videoconferencing technology.

Adding new technology benefits that provide colleagues the opportunity to order company issued hardware and software to support working from home, regardless of their work designation.

Offering flexibility has always been a part of our culture.

In fact, before the pandemic around 20% of our US workforce was virtual.

Since we announced Amex Flex, the majority of our colleagues in the US have chosen hybrid schedules, opting to spend their time between in office and virtual days, coming into the office about two days per week, while more than 40% have opted to be fully virtual, a percentage that has doubled over the last two years.

As part of Amex Flex, all colleagues, except for those who are required to work onsite, will have the opportunity to work up to 30 days per calendar year from a location other than their primary work location.

Our first office sites to adopt Amex Flex were in the UK and the US in the first quarter of 2022.

Since then, offices in 18 countries in total have started Amex Flex.

Our commitment to be a great place to join, stay, and grow a career continues to earn us industry awards and recognition.

Here are some of the recognitions from 2021 and 2022 that make us proud.

Bloomberg’s Gender Equality Index (since 2016) ranked 13.

Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index ranked 21.

Double annual spend with underrepresented owned suppliers in the US from a 2019 baseline to 750 million by the end of 2024 and increase spend with Black owned suppliers to at least 100 million annually.

We expect the ongoing progress towards this goal and the cumulative spend with underrepresented owned suppliers from late 2020 through 2025 will comprise a significant portion of the 4 billion we aim to spend toward DE I initiatives over this period.

Provide access to capital and financial education to at least 250,000 underrepresented owned small and medium sized business in the US from late 2020 through 2024.

Increase the representation of American Express Leadership Academy participants in the US who are from underrepresented groups from 50% in 2019 to 75% by the end of 2024.

When we announced our 1 billion Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE I) Action Plan in October of 2020, we sought to build on our foundation of supporting diverse representation and equal opportunities for our colleagues, customers, and communities.

That legacy includes a longstanding commitment to fostering an inclusive and welcoming workplace that reflects the diversity of our communities, promoting equal economic opportunity for our diverse customer base and business partners, and supporting community initiatives focused on advancing equality and social justice.

As of March 2022, we exceeded 1 billion in spending since October 2020 toward our DE I Action Plan, ahead of schedule.

Our investments included spending with underrepresented owned suppliers, expanding access to capital and financial education for underrepresented owned small businesses, supporting partnerships with nonprofit organizations focused on promoting equality and social justice, and investments in pay equity.

Building on our progress, we now plan to spend an additional 3 billion toward DE I initiatives for an ambition to spend 4 billion in total from late 2020 through the end of 2025.

The majority of additional spend will continue to be allocated to underrepresented owned suppliers.

Global investments outside the United States may include initiatives like Blueprint: Backing BIPOC Businesses, a mentorship and grant program designed to support the advancement of Black, Indigenous, or People of Color (BIPOC) business owners in Canada.

Launched last year, 100 Blueprint recipients own and operate small businesses in cities across Canada and represent a wide range of industries, including agriculture, consulting services, and technology solutions.

At American Express, we work to create an inclusive culture in the workplace, where our colleagues feel welcome and supported to reach their full potential the marketplace, where businesses and consumers have equal economic opportunities and society, where equality is supported and diversity is celebrated.

We bring our DE I vision to life by embedding diversity, equity, and inclusion in our company culture and operations, executing on the priorities and goals we set for ourselves, and holding our company and leaders accountable for progress on and achievement of those goals.

We are committed to delivering a great colleague experience at American Express.

We seek to foster an inclusive environment where colleagues can grow and develop in ways that are unique and meaningful to them and have the backing and flexibility they need to bring their authentic selves to work and thrive in their professional and personal lives.

In our 2021 annual Colleague Experience Survey, 90% of survey participants said they would recommend American Express as a great place to work.

Based on the findings from our 2021 annual Colleague Experience Survey, we are continuing our focus on strong enterprise leadership and agile decision making in the way we work.

In the spring of 2022, we launched Amex Flex, a hybrid work model that is designed to recapture in person connections, collaboration, and relationship building, while also retaining the flexibility and efficiencies of working virtually.

Learn more in Amex Flex: Our New Way of Working in the Our Commitment to ESG section of this report.

We are focused on creating an inclusive and welcoming culture where colleagues feel that they belong, that their contributions are highly valued, and that their voices are heard.

Through our 14 Colleague Networks globally, we are providing our colleagues with opportunities to engage, share common experiences, support each other’s development, and give back to their communities.

From hiring and onboarding to growing careers, we seek to foster an inclusive environment where colleagues can grow and thrive in ways that are unique and meaningful to them and have the backing and flexibility they need to deliver their best.

Our focus is on fostering an inclusive and equitable culture for all colleagues.

Our full US Workforce Employer Information Report (EEO 1) data can be found in the Supporting Data section.

Since 2015, American Express has been included on the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index (GEI). The GEI highlights public companies committed to disclosing their efforts to support gender equality through policy development, representation, and transparency.

As of year end 2021 based on the U.S. EEO 1 job categories.

American, or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander, and two or more races.

To help inform and improve our diversity, equity, and inclusion practices, we track our hiring, promotions, and talent retention rates, including for gender globally and for race and ethnicity in the US. As part of our commitment to ongoing transparency, we’re providing additional detailed disclosures in this year’s report, including disaggregated representation data by race and ethnicity in the US as shown in the table below.

We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure colleagues in the same job, level and location are compensated fairly regardless of gender globally, and race and ethnicity in the United States.

In 2021, for the second consecutive year, we achieved 100% pay equity meaning no statistical differences in pay across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the US. Our pay equity achievement is supported by compensation policies, processes, and practices designed to pay colleagues in all roles and at all levels based on performance and other business related criteria, making appropriate salary adjustments where needed.

As part of the evaluation of our pay practices and reward structure, we have conducted annual pay equity reviews with independent experts since 2017.

Since 2019, this analysis has covered our entire global colleague population across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the US, assessing pay on a statistical basis and considering key factors that influence compensation, including but not limited to tenure, role, level, geography, and performance.

In 2021, we began disclosing the raw median pay gap for women globally and for diverse colleagues in the United States.

This metric compares differences in raw median base pay, with no adjustments for factors such as role, level, tenure, performance, or geography.

In 2021, the median pay for women globally at American Express was 106.7% of the median pay for men.

We believe our pay equity review provides a more accurate and comprehensive picture of our compensation practices overall because it provides a more granular view that considers many important factors known to affect an individual’s compensation.

For this reason, we use pay equity as the standard we hold ourselves accountable to.

We remain committed to maintaining 100% pay equity for colleagues across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the US by continuing our annual pay equity review process.

As of year end 2021 based on the U.S. EEO 1 job categories.

Race ethnicity based on self identified information.

Less than 1% of new colleague hires did not disclose their race or ethnicity in 2021.

Includes colleagues that self identify as Native American or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or two or more races.

US racially ethnically diverse colleagues based on US EEO 1 categories including Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, Native American, or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and two or more races.

We attribute our success to the more than 64,000 colleagues who drive our business.

We’re proud that our efforts to provide an environment where a diverse workforce can thrive has garnered outside recognition, from our highest ever ranking of 8 on FORTUNE’s 100 Best Companies to Work For to LinkedIn naming us one of the top 10 companies to grow your career in the UK, to GirlCode naming us to the Top 10 Diversity and Inclusion Power List for 2022, to the Human Rights Campaign naming us to their Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality list in 2022.

We have established over 30 partnerships to help us broaden our reach and support our enterprise objectives to recruit new talent and retain high performing colleagues.

One of our key partners is PowertoFly (PTF), an organization focused on connecting underrepresented talent to companies.

Through our engagement efforts, PTF supports our global hiring efforts across multiple talent segments and levels of the organization.

American Express has partnered with PowerToFly since 2017 to help build and retain their inclusive and diverse workplace in the US, UK, and India.

Together, we’ve targeted talent segments including Tech, Finance, Sales Marketing, and Risk Analytics through events, virtual job fairs, sponsorship of PowerToFly’s Diversity Reboot Summit series, and more.

To support our efforts to create an inclusive and welcoming culture for our colleagues, we introduced two trainings in 2020: a Strengthening Our Culture of Belonging and Inclusion course and a Belonging at Amex workshop.

We supplemented these trainings with conversations and informational sessions on how colleagues can contribute to a culture of inclusion.

For US colleagues who use adoption, surrogacy, or egg sperm donors, we offer reimbursement that covers expenses up to 35,000 for up to two events, with a lifetime maximum of 70,000.

Those who undergo reproductive treatments are eligible for up to 35,000 in medical assistance.

Throughout, colleagues had access to numerous resources on leading inclusively, having meaningful conversations, and making their voices heard.

In addition to our Colleague Networks, we have nine Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Councils across Business Units and in office locations to address local priorities.

We adopted our son and in fact, Amex has been there for us since day one and throughout every step of the way, says Sean B., an analyst in our Global Risk and Compliance department.

The company’s family planning and assistance program provided us with the financial support to adopt earlier than what we thought was possible.

Additionally, the family concierge benefit helped us throughout the adoption process and is a resource we continue to use when we need childcare.

The dependent care flexible spending account has also provided comfort financially, Sean added, which has especially been helpful during these current times when we’re doing the best we can in a lot of situations that are entirely new and the challenges we’ve had to navigate around due to COVID.

This support continues after colleagues welcome their new family members.

Under our gender neutral parental leave policy, eligible colleagues in the United States can take up to 20 weeks parental leave with full base pay, whether they’re welcoming a child through pregnancy, adoption, or surrogacy.

We also provide six to eight weeks of additional leave if medically necessary.

We also provide colleagues in Canada, the UK, and the US access to in home or center based childcare when their regular arrangements fall through, as well as connection with 24 7 consultants who can help arrange in home care for an adult loved one recovering from an illness or injury.

In 2021, women represented more than half of our workforce worldwide, and approximately four out of 10 senior executives were women.

We are invested in engaging, retaining, and backing our women colleagues and helping them realize their professional potential through initiatives and programs that help them grow, develop, and thrive.

For example, in India, we have established more than 20 small peer group Lean In Circles designed to build connection and new skills.

Through customized training and partnerships with external organizations, we offer colleagues a variety of meaningful learning and development opportunities.

In 2020, we launched the Ambition Project in partnership with The New York Women’s Foundation to encourage our women colleagues to fully embrace their ambition and support the ambitions of others.

In 2022, we once again partnered with the New York Women’s Foundation for a global study on women’s relationship with ambition, both in their careers and personal lives and their confidence in achieving success after a global pandemic.

Amidst a rapidly changing workforce, women remain ambitious, and we continue to proudly back their aspirations.

In 2022, nearly 4,000 colleagues around the world joined our enterprise wide International Women’s Day events live, featuring American Express leaders and external guests, in addition to 30 local events.

For example, our Japan Women’s Network organized an event with a guest speaker on the topic of how to Design Your Ambition.

We are committed to providing colleagues with an inclusive work environment, from accessibility tools on the job to benefits that support a healthy work life balance.

In 2021, we enabled closed captioning as a standard for virtual livestream events to make broadcast content more accessible.

We also launched enhanced accessibility features for online meetings, such as closed captioning, screen reader notifications, and the ability to change chat font size.

These represent just a few of the resources and best practices we’ve made available to colleagues across the enterprise.

To advance our disability inclusion initiatives, we’re now members of the Inclusion Works community as part of our Disability:IN partnership, in which we collaborate with disability inclusion experts to implement best practices in this space.

We’ve continued our membership in the Valuable 500 in the UK, which enlists companies to keep disability inclusion on the leadership agenda and make a commitment to action.

Within our company, our Disability Awareness Network (DAN) plays an important role in creating a sense of belonging and community among our colleagues with seen and unseen disabilities and raising awareness for disability inclusion.

For International Day of Persons with Disabilities in December 2021, DAN brought together authors, advocates, entrepreneurs, mental health experts, and our colleagues from India, Spain, the UK, and beyond under the common theme of Recognize More: Proudly Backing Disability Inclusion.

This virtual event was an opportunity to drive inclusion of people with disabilities by demonstrating support and helping educate allies on how best to partner with their colleagues with disabilities.

A culture of belonging gains strength when colleagues worldwide have opportunities to make their voices heard, listen, learn, and build their skills for inclusive leadership.

Heritage months and cultural moments provided valuable occasions to spark these conversations and connections.

For instance, Black Engagement Network (BEN) chapters across Canada and the United States celebrated Black History Month with a variety of events, open to all colleagues, under the theme of Say It Loud.

BEN, in partnership with its executive committee sponsors, also promoted networking and development for vice presidents and above.

Executive BEN held its sixth Global Forum in June 2021.

The forum brought together 72 Black leaders from across the company, our CEO and Executive Committee members, and host Anr Williams, CEO, American Express National Bank and Group President of Enterprise Services.

Attendees gained exposure to new perspectives, networked, honed their leadership skills, and helped shape plans for driving change for our Black colleagues.

In 2022, we made Juneteenth, also known as Black Independence Day, a company holiday in the US, giving colleagues the day to learn, celebrate, and reflect.

Juneteenth is a reminder of both the progress that has been made and the work still left to be done to ensure all people have equal opportunities to achieve dignity, happiness, and success.

During Hispanic and Latinx Heritage Month, our Hispanic Origin and Latin American Colleague Network (HOLA), hosted global events focused on Amplifying the Impact: Proudly Backing Hispanic and Latinx Achievement.

Our theme showcased our commitment to celebrating our Hispanic and Latinx colleagues appreciating who they are, acknowledging the strength they bring to our organization, and amplifying the lasting impact of their accomplishments.

During Asian Pacific American Heritage Month in 2022, we celebrated the rich cultural diversity of our colleagues with the theme Make Culture Shine: Proudly Backing All Asian Communities.

Developing new climate impact of our operations climate related risks and opportunities capabilities for our customers and partners.

Supporting community programs and initiatives to help build more climate resilient and equitable communities.

Advancing climate solutions starts with our own operations.

Since 2018, we have been a CarbonNeutral company, powered by 100% renewable electricity across our global operations.5 To build on these efforts, in 2021 we committed to net zero emissions by 2035 in alignment with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

We are also working to enhance the management of our climate related risks and opportunities across our business and became a formal supporter of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

In 2020 and 2021, we conducted a qualitative climate risk scenario analysis to assess physical and transition risks to our business related to climate change in alignment with the TCFD.

We assessed transition risks associated with current and emerging regulations, technology advances, and market and reputational impacts and identified opportunities, including developing new low carbon products and services for customers.

Additionally, ESG risks in particular climate risk have been included as an emerging risk for the company, and are part of our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.

For more detailed data on our consumption of electricity, renewable energy, and Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, please see the Environmental Performance Data Summary and Limited Assurance Statement of GHG Emissions in the Supporting Data section.

We have also continued to leverage programs like Green2Gether to engage our colleagues in sustainability initiatives.

For our customers and partners, we set a goal to pilot new low carbon product innovations by the end of 2022.

We’ve made progress toward this goal, including piloting carbon tracking solutions for corporate clients, launching new recycled plastic cards in Canada and France, and partnering with Delta Air Lines on cards made from 70% reclaimed plastic that received a certification as a CarbonNeutral product in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol.

To support more climate resilient and equitable communities, we launched a goal to provide at least 10 million from 2021 through 2025 to support initiatives, partnerships, and programs that address the adverse effects of climate change and pollution on communities.

Manage our climate related risks and opportunities.

Develop new capabilities to enable our customers and partners to transition to a low carbon economy.

Support community programs and initiatives to help build more climate resilient and equitable communities.

Advancing climate solutions globally requires a collaborative approach, so in April and May 2022, we announced new partnerships with nonprofits.

Through grants to American Forests, C40 Cities, National Park Foundation, and Earthwatch Institute, we plan to fund projects and initiatives to support nature based solutions and sustainability efforts in local communities, particularly in urban areas.

Partnering with these organizations is another important step in our objective to advance climate solutions.

In May 2022, we closed our first ever ESG bond issuance.

We intend that an amount equivalent to the net proceeds of the 1 billion ESG bond will be allocated toward projects in the Green and Social categories, including investments in green buildings and initiatives supporting a circular economy.

We support the shift toward a low carbon economy, in line with the science based recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

In 2019, we set operational environmental goals for 2025 that cover energy and water use, waste generation, green building certifications, the phaseout of single use plastics, and responsible paper sourcing in 2021, we made progress on these goals.

However, our reductions in energy, waste, and water were also greatly impacted by office closures due to the pandemic and we expect usage to increase as colleagues return to the office.

While progress toward our operational environmental goals will not be linear, we expect to continue to make important advances to meet them over the next few years.

We made this commitment based on the SBTi’s most ambitious level of climate action, to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels.

In signing on to the Business Ambition for 1.5 C and the UN Race to Zero Campaign, American Express is among a growing roster of more than 1,400 companies setting targets to the 1.5 C goal.

Since our operations are already carbon neutral, we will focus on our supply chain and work with our vendors, encouraging them to establish their own science based emissions reduction targets and track, reduce, and eventually neutralize their operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Operations include all our managed facilities, field sites, and data centers.

Managed facilities are individual properties operationally managed by our global real estate team and housing critical business functions.

Field sites are individual properties that are not operationally managed by our global real estate team but directly by our business units.

They are typically smaller sites, less than 30,000 square feet (including airport lounges, foreign exchange kiosks, and sales offices), that are owned or leased by American Express.

The company’s goal to remain carbon neutral covers Scope 1 (direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by American Express), Scope 2 (indirect location based and market based emissions), Scope 3 emissions (Category 5 waste generated in operations and Category 6 business travel) through renewable energy credits, carbon offsets, and reduced GHG emissions.

American Express is following the methodology of the SBTi for our commitment to net zero by 2035, which covers all Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a minimum of two thirds of total Scope 3 emissions in conformance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.

In 2019, we set a goal to have 60% of the total square footage of leased or owned facilities actively occupied by American Express be green building certified by 2025.

Since the beginning of 2019, we have spent more than 150 million on the development of facilities that have received green building certifications.

In 2021, our operations continued to be impacted by office closures due to COVID 19, implementation of best practices to support health and safety during the pandemic, and adoption of more flexible work arrangements for our colleagues.

Because these changes impacted performance on our operational environmental goals against our 2019 pre pandemic baseline, we have temporarily suspended reporting our performance against these three goals and we are reviewing our methodologies in relation to these changes.

Operations include all our managed facilities, field sites, and data centers.

Managed facilities are individual properties operationally managed by our global real estate team and housing critical business functions.

Field sites are individual properties that are not operationally managed by our global real estate team but directly by our business units.

They are typically smaller sites, less than 30,000 square feet (including airport lounges, foreign exchange kiosks, and sales offices), that are owned or leased by American Express.

Energy use reduction since 2011 calculations are based only on managed facilities where metered data is available which represents 6,786,897ft2 and 99,856 MWh of energy consumption in 2021 and excludes field sites, managed sites with estimated data, and data centers not operationally managed by our global real estate team.

The waste data is reported only for managed facilities where measured data is available.

This represents approximately 67% (4,781,326 ft2) of the globally managed facilities footprint in 2021.

Definition of zero waste is aligned with the US Green Building Council’s standard of a minimum of 90% waste diversion from landfills to achieve zero waste certification.

Green building certified percentage is represented by the total year end square footage certified out of total year end building square footage.

This includes leased or owned facilities actively occupied by American Express (excluding parking lot square footage) that have achieved certification under a global or locally recognized third party environmental building certification system as meeting their performance criteria (LEED, BREEAM, NABERS, GreenMark, HQE, and Effinergie ).

In 2021, we continued to implement energy efficiency initiatives including lighting retrofits, HVAC equipment upgrades, and new building control systems, which are expected to save approximately 1,500 MWh of energy use per year.

Due to these measures and the reduction in energy demand due to temporary work from home arrangements, energy consumption in the facilities we manage in 2021 decreased by approximately 57% compared to our 2011 baseline.

We use several measures in addition to energy efficiency measures to help mitigate GHG emissions from our global operations, including onsite solar electricity generation, energy attribute certificates (EACs), and carbon offsets.

Since 2018, we have powered our global operations with 100% renewable electricity.

In 2021, we produced approximately 561 MWh of renewable solar electricity at our North Carolina data center and Brighton, UK office and we purchased 202,170 MWh of EACs.

EACs verify the production of renewable electricity in an amount equivalent to the total electricity consumption and we purchase in alignment with the technical guidance from RE100, a global coalition of leading businesses committed to using 100% renewable electricity.

We also purchased 22,770 MTCO2e of carbon offsets in 2021, including wind power development, reforestation, and forest conservation projects.

These projects offset our emissions from activities such as fuel consumption, as well as Scope 3 emissions from colleague business travel, and the waste generated in our operations.

For more detailed data on our consumption of electricity, renewable energy, water, and waste, please see the Environmental Performance Data Summary and Limited Assurance Statement of GHG Emissions in the Supporting Data section at the end of this report.

Data centers are critical to the smooth operation of our business.

They also represent approximately 850,000 square feet of our building space and in 2021 used approximately 114,826 MWh around 55% of the electricity that powers our operations.

Our data centers produce 40% of our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions.

Solar panels on our North Carolina data center generated approximately 546 MWh of solar electricity in 2021, and energy efficiency measures across all our data centers have saved an estimated 3,600 MTCO2e in 2021.

Our data centers report a power usage effectiveness (PUE)13 of 1.62 for our production data center,14 1.59 for our redundancy data center,15 and 1.72 for our testing data center.

At our data center in Gurgaon, India, we implemented several energy efficiency and sustainability measures in 2021, including installing high performance thermal insulation that meets India’s Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) standards and reduces external heat gain, and equipping the UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply) system with high efficiency modular units.

As we work to reduce our energy use, maintain carbon neutrality, and find ways to reduce the environmental impact of our real estate footprint, we strive to design, build, and operate facilities that consume less resources, emit fewer greenhouse gases, and improve the quality of the indoor environment for our colleagues’ well being.

We seek to follow sustainability best practices, including the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification program and other international green building standards including BREEAM, NABERS, GreenMark, HQE, and Effinergie .

The PUE is the total overall utility load divided by the total load needed to support the data halls.

Management System (EPMS) which reports real time PUE data.

Primary Data Center for Daily BAU (business as usual) activities 15.

Green building certified percentage is represented by the total year end square footage certified out of total year end building square footage.

This includes leased or owned facilities actively occupied by American Express (excluding parking lot square footage) that have achieved certification under a global or locally recognized third party environmental building certification system as meeting their performance criteria (LEED, BREEAM, NABERS, GreenMark, HQE, and Effinergie ).

We work to improve the sustainability and comfort of our office with ergonomic furniture and sustainable construction materials based on LEED standards.

We also allocate workspace and remote work capabilities in ways designed to offer our colleagues flexibility and to use our real estate efficiently.

As detailed earlier in this section, we made substantial progress against our operational environmental goals for 2025.

However, our reductions in energy, waste, and water across our global operations continued to be impacted by office closures due to COVID 19, health and safety best practices during the pandemic, and adoption of more flexible work arrangements for our colleagues.

Because these changes impacted performance on our operational environmental goals against our 2019 pre pandemic baseline, we have temporarily suspended reporting our performance against our colleague waste and water and single use plastics goals and we are reviewing our methodologies in relation to these changes.

Building attendance remained very low worldwide through 2021.

Following best practices to support colleague health and safety during the pandemic, we removed reusable items from our cafeterias.

In 2020 and 2021, to ensure we followed best practices to support health and safety during the pandemic and as a result of COVID 19 related building closures, we temporarily suspended tracking performance against our single use plastic goal across our operations.

As colleagues return to the office and water usage, energy usage, and waste generation increase, we will examine data and building attendance to give us more accurate insights into our performance against pre pandemic baselines.

In 2019, we set a goal to reduce water consumption at our managed facilities by 10% per colleague by 2025.

We are working toward this goal through colleague engagement and education and building design, such as low flow fixtures and automatic water faucets in our newly opened office building in Phoenix.

In 2021, we consumed 166,171 cubic meters across our global operations, 72% lower than 2019 and substantially impacted by office closures and work from home arrangements due to the pandemic.

Four of our 2025 operational environmental goals are designed to reduce and divert landfill bound waste and to phase out single use plastics.

We launched several initiatives in 2019 to support these goals, including a composting program at our New York headquarters.

We have had to adapt some of these activities to meet COVID 19 related safety protocols, including the reintroduction of single use paper cups in our floor pantries, although we have nevertheless seen a reduction in total waste generation, due in large part to office closures and work from home arrangements.

In 2021, we diverted 54% from landfills compared to 52% in 2020.

Find more water and waste data in the Environmental Performance Data Summary at the end of this report.

To maintain resiliency and business continuity in our offices and data centers we factor climate related physical risks into our short , medium , and long term real estate strategies.

One of our newer buildings in Sunrise, Florida, for example, is designed to withstand Category 5 hurricanes and major flooding events.

In addition, we evaluate qualitative climate related transition risks that may impact our global operations, including current and emerging regulations.

These climate related risks influence our operational strategy and we have identified opportunities to minimize these risks, including by maintaining carbon neutrality and continuing to invest in energy efficiency projects and renewable electricity.

In 2021, we sourced 96% of our direct marketing, customer communications, and office paper from certified responsibly managed forests, working toward a goal of 100% in 2025.

Engaging our colleagues in sustainability initiatives through the Green2Gether program is an important goal of our ESG strategy, and we engage thousands of our colleagues during the year, offering workplace climate education, waste and energy reduction efforts, and volunteer opportunities with non profit partners.

Volunteer led Green2Gether activities range from beach cleanups to recycling drives to innovative virtual Earth Day campaigns during the COVID 19 pandemic.

Every April during Earth Month, colleagues around the world can participate in dozens of company sponsored activities, such as recycling drives, online lectures, community clean ups, and sustainability awareness campaigns.

In 2021, we engaged colleagues virtually to support the planting of 100,000 trees in partnership with The Nature Conservancy’s Plant a Billion Trees campaign, funding approximately 210,000 trees in total since 2017.

In 2022, colleagues have engaged in environmentally focused in person and or virtual volunteer activities and events with The Central Park Conservancy, United Way of Salt Lake City, South Downs National Park (UK), PRIDE Network, Compass Group, Catchafire, and others.

The National Park Foundation’s Service Corps programs support essential preservation projects in national parks across the US. Through a new multi year partnership, we’re providing a total of 1 million in funding over the next three years to support the Service Corps program, building on over 5.7 million in funding to the National Park Foundation since 2015.

In partnership with the Ocean Conservancy and International Coastal Cleanup, American Express colleagues collected approximately 24,000 pounds of marine debris globally from 2018 to 2022.

Colleagues participated in beach cleanups and other initiatives across seven countries, including Australia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Spain, and the US.

We have partnered with Reforestamos M xico, A.C. since 2016 on volunteering efforts to support conservation efforts across Mexico.

Most recently, we have assisted Reforestamos in its actions to conserve more than 200 hectares of forests across five communities.

From 2019 to 2021, colleagues participated in reforestation efforts including planting 4,000 native trees and performing maintenance on fire breaks in the Nevado de Toluca Protected Natural Area.

We also supported efforts to scale nature based climate solutions.

In 2021, we provided funding to the Latin American Seminar on Forest Entrepreneurship and Investment.

The virtual event brought together 800 forestry entrepreneurs, investors, and attendees from government and academia from 16 countries in Latin America to identify nature based solutions to address climate change.

Colleagues also engage in supporting our Advance Climate Solutions goals by developing and implementing innovative programs, including Shop with Purpose initiative during Earth Month 2022.

Each year, American Express hosts a number of innovation challenges which give colleagues around the world the opportunity to pitch new ideas.

New York based colleagues, Christina Glynn, Director of Business Development Future of Membership, Amex Digital Labs and Paul Collins, Director of Strategy and Business Planning, Global Commercial Services saw their idea to help customers shop at conscious minded companies become a reality this year.

Glynn and Collins believed there was an opportunity to support our sustainability efforts by highlighting merchants who share our values and bringing new offers to our Card Members.

To help customers Shop with Purpose, Glynn and Collins developed and launched a curated collection of offers from Certified B Corp companies like Avocado Green Mattress, Stumptown Coffee Roasters and Vestiaire Collective, and other brands committed to making a difference.

Featured throughout Earth Month in 2022, eligible US Consumer and Small Business Card Members were able to earn rewards for spend on eligible purchases with these merchants.

As climate action increases in importance for our customers and partners, we’re exploring new ways to deliver responsible products and services, help our customers make informed decisions, and promote responsible travel and conscientious consumption.

To reinforce this, in 2021, we set a goal to pilot low carbon product innovations by the end of 2022.

Our customers and partners want to understand their environmental impact, reduce their carbon footprint, and play a part in the transition to a low carbon economy.

Across the company, we’re enhancing our capabilities to support them.

For our corporate clients, we offer tools such as our Carbon Offset Referral Suite.

The suite launched in June 2022 and provides US corporate customers with a curated list of carbon offset providers who can help them manage their footprint via offset solutions that include investments in large scale carbon removal and reduction projects and avoidance projects.

This year, we’re developing new offerings as we work toward our goal to pilot low carbon product innovations by the end of 2022.

With our Shop with Purpose program, which won our enterprise wide Innovation Challenge in 2020, we provided customers with special promotions through Amex Offers with select Certified B Corp companies and other brands committed to making a difference during Earth Month in 2022.

We currently make our Carbon Footprint Dashboard available to certain commercial clients to help track estimated carbon emissions associated with their employees’ air travel.

Methodology: This Amex Trendex online poll was conducted by Morning Consult between February 3 11th, 2022 among a national sample of 2,000 US and 1,000 travelers in Japan, Australia, Mexico, India, UK, and Canada who have a household income of at least 70K and defined as adults who typically travel by air at least once a year.

Results from each market’s survey have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

American Express’ Carbon Footprint Tool calculations are derived by applying selected conversion factors to spending made with the following American Express Corporate products: Corporate Card, Business Travel Account, Corporate Meeting Card, Corporate Purchasing Card, Buyer Initiated Payments, vPayments and Amex Go.

The estimated information provided by the Carbon Footprint Tool is for generalized informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, tax, accounting, legal or other professional advice on any subject matter.

To reduce the company’s consumption of virgin plastic, in 2019, we launched the first American Express Card manufactured primarily from reclaimed plastic collected from beaches and coastal communities.

Since then, we have set a goal for the vast majority of plastic cards issued by American Express be made from at least 70% recycled or reclaimed plastic by the end of 2024.

By achieving this goal, we can help avoid nearly 160,000 pounds of virgin plastic from being used annually.

To support this goal, we have already begun expanding our offerings to integrate recycled plastic into our card materials.

In summer 2021, we launched our first card made from recycled PVC in Canada.

In 2022, we announced that France will become the first market to shift to recycled plastic for almost all of our plastic cards.

Additionally, as an example of collaboration with our strategic partners to collectively support our sustainability goals, we partnered with Delta Air Lines on the Delta SkyMiles American Express Cards made from 70% reclaimed plastic that achieved CarbonNeutral product certification.

In 2019, we launched our Card Take Back Program that enables US Card Members to return both plastic and non plastic cards by mail for recycling.

Since the launch of the program, we’ve recycled more than 1.3 million cards, including cards returned by Card Members.

In 2021, 95% of Card Member payments were electronic19 and 66% of statements were paperless,20 up from 94% and 61%, respectively, in 2020.

Electronic includes payments received via phone, online, Auto Pay, third party remits and wire transfers 20.

Travel is a key part of our services and heritage.

Our ESG efforts in this area start at home by offsetting our carbon footprint associated with employee business travel including third party air, rail, and rental cars.

To reduce the impact of executive travel, for example, we continue to scale up our use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in our corporate jet fleet.

We are also a member of the World Economic Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition, which supports efforts to transition to sustainable aviation fuel and achieve carbon neutral air travel across the aviation sector.

We also signed on to the Clean Skies for Tomorrow 2030 Ambition Statement, to accelerate the supply and use of sustainable aviation fuel technologies to reach 10% of the global jet aviation fuel supply by 2030.

Additionally, through our Global Insights and Advisory Team, we offer our large and global corporate customers data driven insights into the changes in business travel due to the pandemic, data that can help benchmark their existing travel polices against their peers and reporting on considerations on the environmental impact of business travel generally.

In 2021, we partnered with the World Economic Forum on several initiatives.

As a member of the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on Sustainable Tourism, we are working with government, business, and academic leaders to advance innovation on inclusive and sustainable tourism.

We signed on to the Clean Skies for Tomorrow 2030 Ambition Statement, to accelerate the supply and use of sustainable aviation fuel technologies to reach 10% of the global jet aviation fuel supply by 2030.

In March 2021, our Ventures team announced our strategic investment in this innovative aerospace company Boom Supersonic, which is seeking to build a supersonic and sustainable airliner.

Our backing is expected to help fund the continued development of the Overture, Boom’s flagship product.

The Overture is anticipated to be able to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel, including biofuels manufactured using renewable materials, and other low carbon fuel technologies.

We also became a founding member of the Boom Sustainable Travel Forum, a partnership to forge relationships and exchange ideas with the private sector, NGOs, and industry experts, which convened for the first time at the inaugural Net Good Summit in November 2021.

Canada who have a household income of at least 70,000 and defined as adults who typically travel by air at least once a year.

Results from each country survey have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

We seek to advance climate solutions through programs and initiatives that help build more climate resilient and equitable communities.

In 2021, we set a goal to provide at least 10 million in support by the end of 2025 for initiatives, partnerships, and programs that address the adverse effects of climate change and pollution on communities.

To support this goal, we launched a new community giving priority: Backing Low Carbon Communities.

In 2022, we announced 3.1 million in grants to American Forests, the National Park Foundation, Save the Children UK, C40 Cities, and Earthwatch Institute to support nature based solutions and sustainability efforts in local communities, particularly in urban areas.

We are grateful for the incredible commitment American Express has made to support Tree Equity and climate resiliency in cities.

The work we’re doing together will boost the supply of trees that communities need to equitably cool and cleanse the air in their neighborhoods and create local jobs in the process, even giving us the capacity to expand this work to other countries.

Backing Low Carbon Communities grants support nature based solutions, community led climate initiatives, and disaster response and resilience efforts in local communities, particularly in urban areas.

American Forests to support its Tree Equity program by bringing more native and climate resilient trees to four US cities where American Express has offices: Phoenix, New York, Salt Lake City, and Sunrise, Florida.

The grant will provide support to help identify and increase local tree nurseries, plant urban forests, and create entry level jobs to help historically marginalized populations transition into the tree care industry.

Additionally, the grant will help expand Tree Equity Score to its first international location, a tool that indicates whether neighborhoods have enough trees for everyone to experience their health, economic and, climate benefits.

National Park Foundation to support service corps programs over the next three years.

These programs will deliver job opportunities for young people from underrepresented backgrounds and identities to experience careers in the outdoors.

Service Corps members will engage in essential preservation projects that help alleviate the effects of climate change in national parks across the US.

Save the Children U.K. to support its Adolescent Skills for Successful Transition program to educate youth on sustainable practices and products and fund the development of its Green Climate Fund pipeline to develop youth led climate adaptation projects.

C40 Cities to fund its efforts to develop consumption based emissions inventories in New York City and London to inform a suite of actions to incentivize more sustainable consumption in collaboration with people and businesses.

The project is also expected to pioneer new ways for other cities to measure emissions from urban consumption.

Announced in May 2022 by New York City Mayor Eric Adams and C40 Chair and Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, this partnership will help both cities in delivering C40’s Good Food Declaration by providing data and insights to increase access to nutritious food and reduce food waste.

Earthwatch Institute to fund the planting of a Tiny Forest in the United Kingdom, helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change and enhance biodiversity.

The grant will also provide planting, maintenance, and monitoring volunteer opportunities to our colleagues and support the creation of a Climate Change Master Class for our colleague base.

The class, led by scientists, will provide education and tools to help our colleagues reduce the impacts of climate change.

We continued to fund disaster relief and response efforts around the world, as we have for many years.

To build on these efforts, we are providing support for disaster relief and resilience building programs and initiatives to help create climate resilient communities in extreme weather prone areas and cities where our colleagues and customers live and work.

These grants aim to build capacity for mitigating the impacts of climate change, focusing on areas such as land management, water stewardship, climate resilience and adaptation, and education.

As extreme weather events disrupted communities worldwide throughout 2021, we were there to help with more than 650,000 for disaster response, working with organizations such as the Red Cross, Feeding America, and the International Medical Corps.

Our support focused on addressing the immediate needs of those who have been injured or displaced, providing temporary shelter and meals for first responders and affected families, distributing clean up supplies, and connecting affected people to mental health support, COVID 19 supplies, and other assistance.

Multiple tornadoes swept across the Midwest and Southern US.

Winter storms resulted in widespread power outages in Texas.

Hurricane Ida brought catastrophic wind damage, rain, flooding, and dangerous tornadoes to the US Gulf Coast and Northeast.

Wildfires in California destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses and forced citizens across the state to evacuate.

A 7.2 magnitude earthquake resulted in widespread damage and left thousands in need of support in Haiti.

We engage our colleagues by matching eligible colleague contributions toward disaster relief through the American Express Match program, recommending charities, and connecting US colleagues to information about becoming an American Red Cross disaster response volunteer.

To help fight the impact of climate change on the most vulnerable populations across Asia and Africa, we have partnered with Save the Children U.K. to develop and execute programs that engage youth to help reduce food insecurity exacerbated by climate change, support climate resilient economic development and skills training through green job opportunities, and strengthen early warning systems to help these communities better prepare for extreme weather events.

As part of these activities, we announced a 600,000 grant to support Adolescent Skills for Successful Transition, an educational program on sustainable practices and products, and to fund the development of a Green Climate Fund pipeline for youth led climate adaptation projects.

In Sierra Leone, Save the Children U.K. is conducting research in 20 highly climate vulnerable communities along the coastline.

The goal is to provide ideas to enhance opportunities for innovation and sustainable income generation in the coastal community.

A special emphasis is to ensure women and youth have access to new skills, networks, markets, and institutions to become more climate resilient and enhance sustainable development.

Provide access to credit to at least four million individuals from underserved or underrepresented populations from 2021 through 2025.

Provide at least five million individuals with tools, resources, and educational content to improve financial well being from 2021 through 2025.

Support small businesses, including by reaching 100 billion in spending by consumers at small, independently owned retailers or restaurants on Small Business Saturday and during other Shop Small campaigns from 2021 through 20251.

Invest 500 million to build more resilient and equitable communities from 2021 through 2025.

Based on spend as reported by consumers in surveys commissioned by American Express (not actual receipts or sales).

The American Express 2021 Small Business Saturday Consumer Insights Survey was conducted by Teneo on behalf of American Express and the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB).

The sample was collected using an email invitation and an online survey.

The study gathered self reported data and does not reflect actual receipts or sales.

It was conducted anonymously on November 28, 2021.

The survey has an overall margin of error of 2.0%, at the 95% level of confidence.

Projections are based on the current US Census estimates of the US adult population, age 18 years and over.

At American Express, building financial confidence for our colleagues, our customers, and in our communities is a natural extension of our role as a global financial services leader and is a core pillar of our ESG strategy.

Our efforts to build financial confidence start at home with our colleagues.

Through competitive benefits, financial support such as additional contributions to US colleagues’ retirement accounts, and skill building opportunities like our Harvard Leadership Edge program, we are helping our colleagues build their financial confidence and resilience.

For our customers, we’re empowering individuals to build and maintain their financial well being through products and services, such as MyCredit Guide and Score Goals and our new all digital US consumer checking account.

We also continue to support local small businesses through initiatives like Shop Small and Small Business Saturday.

In our communities, we are helping build resilience through grants, programs, and initiatives that support economic empowerment and equity.

We are expanding our reach into our communities through partnerships, such as our Backing Small grant programs that support economically vulnerable small business owners, and an expanded global partnership with Junior Achievement Worldwide to provide financial literacy education and training to students in 11 countries.

Through our American Express Center for Community Development (CCD), we provided 265 million in community development loans and investments in 2021 that supported small business needs, job creation and retention, and affordable housing.

We are excited to share progress against our goals and highlights from our new and longstanding programs.

You’ll also learn about how we are addressing common challenges within our industry, from strengthening data privacy and security to protecting our customers against fraud.

Read on to learn more about how we have been helping our colleagues, customers, and communities build financial confidence.

Building financial confidence starts at home, with our colleagues.

Whether planning for college, buying a home, or budgeting daily expenses, smart saving pays off.

We help our colleagues build their knowledge and skills for all life stages through our global Smart Saving programs.

In the US, this includes financial planning coaching sessions and workshops, retirement webinars, and on demand access to financial education resources, as well as offers for savings on everyday expenses.

Through our financial planning partner, Goldman Sachs Ayco Personal Financial Management (Ayco), we provide US colleagues access to Ayco’s Financial Wellness program which includes a digital platform, one on one guidance from a financial coach as well as financial planning webinars offered throughout the year.

We connect US colleagues to digital tools and resources to help their financial decision making on topics ranging from debt management, benefits, retirement, investing, tax planning, and estate planning.

US Colleagues can also track their income and spending habits and work with a coach to make goals and a plan to achieve them.

We also partnered with certain of our colleague networks in 2021 and held network specific workshops to educate, encourage coaching sessions, and promote the platform.

For the third consecutive year, we helped our US colleagues manage their student debt through the SAVEtember and Smart Saving Student Debt Programs.

These programs provided 300 colleagues with student debt a 500 cash award once they completed a financial wellness assessment and attended a financial well being webinar on managing student loan debt.

Through the American Express Scholarship Program, we also help American Express colleagues in the US and Canada fund their children’s undergraduate college education through scholarship awards based on financial need that range from 2,000 to 4,000 per year.

Over 1,500 colleagues enrolled in our first 2021 offering of Harvard Leadership Edge, a hands on, customized eight week program for building leadership skills.

Retirement funds are a great way to build financial confidence for the future.

For US colleagues, we match 100% of 401(k) contributions up to 6% of total pay after six months of service, and all matching contributions are immediately vested.

In 2021, 94% of US colleagues took advantage of our retirement plan, up from 93% in 2020.

For 2021, US new hires were automatically enrolled at 3% of total pay, with a 1% automatic annual increase up to 10% of total pay.

For 2022, US new hires are automatically enrolled at 6% of total pay.

Those previously enrolled at 3%, will be brought up to 6%, and will continue with an annual automatic increase of 1% up to 10% of total pay.

Colleagues have access to a wide variety of resources: career coaching, mentoring, professional networking, and rotation opportunities, as well as courses on demand and with classroom style instruction.

Since 2018, our New People Leader Program, for example, has helped more than 3,000 first time managers through the executive level prepare for their new roles.

When analysts, team leaders, managers, and directors sought hands on, customized ways to build their leadership skills, we responded with Harvard Leadership Edge.

Based on colleague feedback, this eight week program is grounded in our Leadership Behaviors, with self guided lessons colleagues can apply on the job.

Over 1,500 colleagues enrolled in our first 2021 offering of Harvard Leadership Edge.

Colleagues viewed nearly 1 million LinkedIn Learning videos in 2021.

Professional growth and development are another important aspect of financial confidence.

Our investment here starts with opportunities for colleagues to learn on the job, build cross functional skills, and grow in their careers through a defined, collaborative process for performance management.

We also made available to colleagues LinkedIn Learning, a platform that provides quick and easy access to thousands of online courses and videos.

The platform offers lessons in seven languages on topics including leadership, business skills, technology, and personal development.

We are focused on strengthening the financial security and money management capacity of small businesses through products, services, campaigns, and initiatives, and empowering individuals to build and maintain their financial well being through products, services, tools, and education, while providing robust account security.

We launched Small Business Saturday in 2010 to help independent retailers and restaurants gain more customers in the wake of the financial crisis.

Over the past 12 years, the campaign has evolved into a tradition for consumers and merchants across the United States.

Shop Small has grown into a global, year round movement.

To address the challenges of the pandemic, we strengthened our support even more.

Small Business Saturday’s impact expands beyond the merchants and individuals making purchases on one particular day.

Our commitment of up to 200 million in 2020 supported a Card Member offer and the associated marketing campaign to encourage American Express Card by American Express reporting spend habits on Small Business Saturday since 2012.

Each such survey was conducted online among a nationally representative sample of US adults.

The data was projected from the samples based on then current US Census estimates of the US adult population (18 ).

The study is a nationally representative sample of 2,572 US adults 18 years of age or older.

The sample was collected using an email invitation and an online survey.

The study gathered self reported data and does not reflect actual receipts or sales.

It was conducted anonymously on November 29, 2020.

The survey has an overall margin of error of 2.0%, at the 95% level of confidence.

Projections are based on the current US Census estimates of the US adult population, age 18 years and over.

Members in select countries around the globe to Shop Small in their local communities and online.

Our commitment of more than 100 million supported Card Member offers, as well as marketing to encourage customers in select countries to support small businesses in 2021.

The study is a nationally representative sample of 2,426 US adults 18 years of age or older.

The sample was collected using an email invitation and an online survey.

The study gathered self reported data and does not reflect actual receipts or sales.

It was conducted anonymously on November 28, 2021.

The survey has an overall margin of error of 2.0%, at the 95% level of confidence.

Projections are based on the current US Census estimates of the US adult population, age 18 years and over.

Spending based on the American Express 2020 and 2021 Small Business Saturday Consumer Insights Survey.

Our small business resources also responded to specific challenges and needs outside the United States.

In Japan, we collaborated with a delivery platform on discount offers, used crowd funding to drive support for small restaurants impacted by the pandemic, and provided sanitization tool kits to help small business owners welcome their customers safely.

In the UK, consumers reported spending an estimated 598 million at small businesses on Small Business Saturday, held December 4, 2021.9.

In Canada, approximately 145,000 Card Members enrolled in Shop Small offers, driving 582,000 redemptions at more than 90,000 merchants in 2021.

Our flagship Shop Small campaign encourages consumers worldwide to support their local independent businesses.

To address the challenges of the pandemic, we committed more than 100 million to encourage customers to support small businesses as part of our Let’s Go Shop Small campaign in 2021.

In the UK, for example, our research showed that targeted social media drove UK consumers to spend more with small businesses.

To connect consumers and merchants, we created an online map and shared Social Spotlights of four independent businesses in London.

In Australia, thousands of businesses took part in Shop Small, including many micro businesses.

The resilience that Australian small business operators have shown throughout the COVID 19 crisis has been extraordinary.

And it’s encouraging to see consumers, big business, and government rallying to back the sector, but now is not the time for complacency, says Lisa Belcher, Vice President of Small and Medium Enterprises for American Express in Australia.

That’s why Shop Small is returning to remind shoppers that if they want to see these businesses survive, they have to take action and spend with them regularly.

Estimated spend based on data collected from 4,000 UK adults polled by market research agency Opinium between 5pm on Saturday 4 December 2021 and 10pm on Sunday 5 December 2021.

The 598 million figure for national spending calculated using ONS estimation of the UK adult population based on self reported shopper estimates of spend and does not reflect actual receipts or sales.

Our global network of Customer Care Professionals is just one way we have our customers’ backs.

Small and mid size firms often lack the time, tools, and resources to pursue business growth opportunities or gain new skills and expertise.

Business Advocacy programs such as Business Class address this need through lifestyle like content and experiences, including articles, events, video series, Instagram Live content, and more all available to business owners at no cost.

In 2021, we debuted the first season of a new video series called Business Class: The Series that takes viewers around the world and across industries to learn real life lessons from fellow entrepreneurs.

Episodes explore different ways to approach everyday business challenges including leadership, finance, marketing, strategy, and managing growth.

We made learning interactive with two new seasons of Office Hours casual and informative conversations taking place live on Instagram, where entrepreneurs and experts answer business owners’ questions and offer advice.

To help thousands of small businesses owners network and grow their capital and customers budgets, we hosted our annual free, Business Class LIVE event, where they virtually connected with and learned from leading thinkers, business executives, and entrepreneurs.

In 2019 we acquired the restaurant booking platform Resy and together we help restaurant businesses thrive.

Throughout the pandemic, we supported independent restaurants by providing fee relief and digital tools to help them run their businesses, data based insights to help restaurants plan smarter, marketing and programming to back the restaurant community, and incentives for Card Members to order take out.

As the impacts of the pandemic continued in 2021, American Express and Resy responded with a series of initiatives to drive customers to small independent restaurants to help with their recovery and long term growth.

In February 2021, we launched the Order In, Help Out campaign that encouraged consumers to make TakeoutTuesday a weekly occurrence and introduced new dining offers on certain American Express Cards.

In 2022, we followed up with Every Resy Counts, a reservation drive as part of the Shop Small campaign that encouraged millions of people across the country to dine at independent restaurants in March 2022.

The Every Resy Counts initiative is part of our broader Let’s Grab a Table Shop Small marketing campaign which was focused on bringing attention and support to independent restaurants throughout the United States.

To help these restaurants rally their customers, we created complimentary toolkits with content, social media posts, signage, and more, as well as specially curated offers, and videos and articles from industry experts to help them grow and manage their businesses.

The industry is starting to see the effect of the past two years.

And that’s when companies like Amex and Resy step up huge to say, this has to change.

Learn more about how we are supporting restaurants in Backing Small for Underrepresented and Economically Vulnerable Small Business Owners.

Building financial confidence opens doors for people to enrich their lives.

One of our ESG objectives is to empower individuals to build and maintain their financial well being through products, services, tools, and education.

In fall 2021, we announced two new goals: to provide access to credit to at least four million individuals from underserved or underrepresented populations from 2021 through 2025, and provide at least five million individuals with tools, resources, and educational content to improve financial well being from 2021 through 2025.

We seek to make available financial education resources and financial literacy programs to young people, first time credit users, and experienced credit users who want to improve their financial management skills.

Our efforts are also focused on product transparency, responsible marketing, non discrimination throughout the credit lifecycle, and robust privacy and security programs.

With MyCredit Guide and Score Goals, we helped millions manage their credit.

VantageScore 3.0 credit score, as well as a detailed TransUnion personal credit report and a credit score simulator to see how actions like paying down debt or opening a new account could affect their score.

Users can also sign up for instant email alerts for any changes in their credit reports.

Through our US based Credit Intel Financial Education Center, we help consumers enhance their knowledge about building credit, understanding credit reports, and understanding different types of credit cards, features, and benefits.

The site shows how credit scores work and how to improve them.

As of May 1, 2022, MyCredit Guide had more than 4.5 million enrolled users.

In 2021, the Credit Intel site attracted 2.8 million unique visitors up from 1.1 million in 2020.

To connect people worldwide to new and innovative ways of building their financial confidence, Amex teamed up with Zogo Financial Education.

When college student Bolun Li realized how little his peers knew about financial literacy topics like taxes and insurance deductibles, he responded with a solution tailored specifically for his generation: Zogo Financial Education, an app designed to make financial education about debt repayment, health insurance, homebuying and more, fun.

In 2021, we partnered with Zogo on a pilot program to offer custom tailored content and additional incentives embedded within the app’s gamified experience.

This joint effort provided Gen Z users with an opportunity to gain valuable financial literacy skills toward their financial well being.

Amex Ventures also invested in the startup BodesWell in 2020, and American Express and BodesWell later co developed and launched the pilot product My Financial Plan in 2021, a self service financial planning tool designed to give Card Member users a complete picture of their financial health and help them make and work toward major life goals, such as buying a house or retirement.

The pilot launched in July 2021 and has provided select American Express Card Members with the opportunity to try out My Financial Plan, to see how income, assets, expenses, liabilities, and cash flow come together for planning life events.

Many newcomers to the United States lack access to US credit due to their international credit histories being stopped at the border.

Since 2019, we’ve been backing the efforts of San Francisco based fintech Nova Credit to address this problem.

Nova Credit’s Credit Passport seamlessly and securely integrates into the American Express online card application process, enabling applicants’ credit records from certain international credit reporting agencies to be instantly translated into a US equivalent credit report and score in just a few clicks allowing American Express to make an application decision.

This industry first integration has helped thousands of newcomers from Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, and the UK access their credit reports and get approved for an American Express Card.

In December 2021, we expanded the application’s reach to people from four more countries: Brazil, Dominican Republic, Kenya, and Nigeria.

To qualify, restaurants must be small and or independently owned, located in a historic building or neighborhood, and have been in business for at least 25 years.

We first launched this initiative in February 2021, working with the National Trust for Historic Preservation to help small restaurants that have contributed to the fabric of their communities so they can better serve their customers, financially recover, and grow their businesses.

For Irene Tsukada Simonian Owner of the Bunkado gift shop in Los Angeles’ Little Tokyo, the grant validates all of the hard work that I put into this as well as my parents and my aunt and uncle who started this business.

I am a retired U.S. Army and Pennsylvania Army National Guardsman and together, my wife and I created our business as a mom and pop hoagie shop.

Most sandwich shops around here are franchises, so we wanted to bring something special to our local community.

Community to us is everything we have customers who travel hours to our shop because they heard about us from a friend and customers can buy a meal and place it on our pay it forward board which will go toward the less fortunate.

But between the pandemic and the current challenges met by inflation, this Inclusive Backing grant has been incredibly encouraging.

A portion of the grant will be used to build a wheelchair ramp so we can offer a more inclusive environment and additional funds will be used toward insulation and re siding to make the shop more energy efficient because with costs continuing to rise, we need to save money where we can.

For small businesses, mentorship can be a valuable tool for solving difficult business challenges and it’s a resource that many Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) entrepreneurs in Canada lack.

We responded with the Blueprint: Backing BIPOC Businesses mentorship and grant program.

The mentorship program, made possible by a grant from the American Express Foundation, brought in seasoned mentors and subject matter experts to talk about topics ranging from strategic planning and leadership to operations management and financial modeling.

One hundred participants from British Columbia to Newfoundland took part in group workshops, one on one coaching, and small group learning sessions.

Each one of the 100 participants received a 10,000 grant to fuel the growth of their business.

As a Black entrepreneur, I’ve always struggled with not only raising capital but finding a mentor and other BIPOC entrepreneurs to connect with, says Harry Julmice, Owner of the Montreal based content and production agency Never Was Average.

Through the Blueprint program, I’m hopeful that the mentorship component will help me save time, resources, and energy by providing me with the tools, guidance, and support I need to achieve my goals and build a sustainable business, he adds.

Women make up such a small percentage of Canadians working in the construction sector, and one of my goals is to help reduce some of those barriers to entry, says Miyoko Oikawa, Owner of Toronto based construction consulting company Building Energy Matters.

The mentor I’ve been matched with is assisting me in my development as an industry leader, and I’m confident that guidance will help me pay it forward with supporting other women in the industry.

We supplemented this effort with 10,000 grants for each of the 100 participants to fuel the growth of their business.

In addition, all eligible businesses among the program’s 1,000 plus applicants received access to the Launchpad for Blueprint online skills development platform.

This survey was conducted by The Nielsen Company on behalf of American Express from April 9 to April 29, 2021, among 1,124 Canadian business owners or partners in small or medium enterprises, 596 of which self identify as Black, Indigenous or a Person of Color (BIPOC) and 528 of which self identify as white.

We plan to leverage our colleague volunteers to help teach and mentor students as part of the program and we expect the Junior Achievement Worldwide program to reach over 5,000 students.

American Express grants aid community organizations in accomplishing their mission.

American Express prioritizes our ESG issues based on their relative importance to our business and to our stakeholders.

We updated our priority ESG issues in 2020 by completing a comprehensive ESG materiality analysis.

Current State Assessment: We conducted internal business research and external benchmarking to identify the most relevant ESG issues to our key stakeholders, industry, and company.

Outputs from the analysis were then considered to create a preliminary list of ESG issues.

ESG Issues Prioritization: Using outputs from our business analysis, benchmarking, and stakeholder engagement activities, we ranked our 20 priority ESG issues based on their relative importance to our business and their relative importance to our stakeholders.

Stakeholder Input: We utilized findings from our assessment to help guide our approach to collecting stakeholder input.

Our third party consultants interviewed more than 30 internal and external stakeholders, including the Chairman and CEO, all Executive Committee members, shareholders, customers, strategic partners, suppliers, nonprofit organizations, and others.

Risk management is overseen by the American Express Board of Directors through three Board Committees: The Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation and Benefits Committee.

The committees meet regularly with the company’s Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance Ethics Officer, the Chief Audit Executive, the Chief Operational Risk Officer, and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, controls, talent, and capabilities.

The Board monitors the tone at the top, our risk culture, and oversees emerging and strategic risks.

The Risk Committee provides oversight of the company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, processes, and methodologies, and approves the company’s ERM policy, which governs risk governance, risk oversight, and risk appetite.

ESG and climate related risks are currently identified as an emerging risk within our ERM framework.

In addition, the Board’s Nominating, Governance, and Public Responsibility Committee (NGPRC) reviews the company’s ESG strategy and Corporate Sustainability program, monitors progress against ESG goals, and provides guidance on our efforts.

The Chief Corporate Affairs Officer (CCAO), who sits on our Executive Committee, and the Vice President of Corporate Sustainability updates the NGPRC on ESG related issues, progress, and performance at least twice annually.

The company’s Executive Committee reviews and evaluates ESG performance and long term goals.

Our CCAO is on the Executive Committee and reports directly to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO).

The CCAO oversees the Corporate Affairs Communications (CA C) Department and has direct responsibility for leading ESG and Corporate Sustainability initiatives, supported by the Corporate Sustainability and ESG Team.

The Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer, is the highest level management committee to oversee all firm wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight, and risk appetite, including the management of ESG and climate risks.

Furthermore, a dedicated group associated with climate risk, with direct accountability to the ERMC, has been established.

The team works closely with business units to monitor climate related issues and opportunities, carbon reduction efforts, energy efficiency initiatives, low carbon product innovations, colleague engagement, and other initiatives in alignment with our ESG Strategy.

Executive compensation is also increasingly linked to our ESG goals.

For example, in prior years, the Company’s annual scorecard’s Colleague category included diversity representation, talent retention, culture, and inclusion metrics as part of the calculation to determine incentive compensation for all eligible colleagues, and in 2021, we also incorporated the management of key ESG priorities, including metrics, into our executive compensation program under the Strategic category of our annual scorecard.

American Express takes a strategic approach to managing the impacts of climate change, considering the risks and opportunities across the short term (0 3 years), medium term (3 6 years), and long term (6 10 years).

In 2020 and 2021, we conducted qualitative analyses of current and potential climate related physical and transition risks and opportunities to our operations, supply chain, and business activities.

Physical Risks: The qualitative climate related physical risk assessment performed in 2020 evaluated potential acute and chronic risks and opportunities associated with the physical impacts of climate change on key operations across several time horizons including historic conditions (1990 2018) and medium term (2035) and long term (2060) projections.

The potential physical risks include flooding due to sea level rise and extreme precipitation, cyclonic storm threats, drought, and extreme temperatures across the some of our critical sites.

These threats could affect operations at our global headquarters, data centers, call centers, offices, and third party supplier card manufacturing sites.

Transition Risks: The qualitative climate related transition risk assessment evaluated three scenarios from the International Energy Agency (IEA) to analyze the impact of transition risks on our company’s potential future revenues and costs between 2025 and 2040.

We assessed transition risks and opportunities associated with current and emerging regulations, technology advances to transition to a low carbon future, and public demand and reputational risks.

We identified potential short , medium , and long term risks including current regulations and carbon pricing emerging regulations related to enhanced emissions reporting requirements shifting consumer preferences reputational risks increased operating costs impacts to travel patterns and geographic or location based risks.

We identified climate related opportunities in the short, medium, and long term that may have financial or strategic impacts on our business.

Opportunities include maintaining carbon neutrality, continuing to invest in energy efficiency projects, onsite renewable electricity generation, renewable Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs), and carbon offsets.

Across our value chain, climate related opportunities exist through innovation and investments in research and development for low carbon products and services.

In addition, we have a goal to pilot low carbon innovations by the end of 2022, including carbon tracking and offset solutions for customers.

Climate related risks and opportunities inform our business, strategy, and financial planning across our direct operations, products and services, funding, and supply chain.

The Advance Climate Solutions pillar of our ESG Strategy includes goals to enhance the management of climate related risks and opportunities across our business, commit to net zero emissions by 2035 in alignment with the Science Based Targets initiative, and pilot low carbon product innovations by the end of 2022.

Our strategy has been influenced by climate related physical and transition risks over the short , medium , and long term, including those associated with emerging regulations and acute and chronic physical risks.

Operations: Climate related opportunities across our operations include reducing operating costs and environmental impacts at our global facilities by improving energy, water, and resource efficiency, and leveraging climate policies and tax incentives to expand onsite renewable energy.

We have been a carbon neutral company powered by 100% renewable electricity across our global operations since 20181 through onsite solar, renewable energy credits, carbon offsets, reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and achieved green building certification across 56% of our operations.2 These investments and initiatives are factored into our annual financial planning processes.

Products Services: To respond to changes in consumer preferences, we invest in research and development to develop and enhance our products and services.

One of our Advance Climate Solutions objectives is to enable our customers and partners to transition to a low carbon economy through the development of new capabilities, supported by a goal to pilot low carbon product innovations, including carbon tracking and offset solutions, by the end of 2022.

In 2019, we launched the first American Express Card made primarily from reclaimed plastic collected from oceans and coasts, which reduces GHG emissions and energy and water consumption during manufacturing compared to virgin plastic.

We also introduced a Card Take Back Program, which enables US Card Members to send back expired or non working cards to American Express for recycling.

We have recycled more than 1.3 million cards since 2019, including cards returned by Card Members.

In 2022, we set a goal for the vast majority of plastic cards issued by American Express to be made of at least 70% recycled or reclaimed plastic by the end of 2024, which can help avoid nearly 160,000 pounds of virgin plastic from being used annually.

For our Corporate clients, our Carbon Footprint Dashboard is available to over 1,000 global corporate clients to help track estimated carbon emissions associated with their employees’ air travel.

We are expanding this tool to include additional categories of spend including ground transportation, hotel stays, restaurants, and retail letting corporate clients better understand behaviors so they can find opportunities to manage carbon emissions.3 In 2022, we launched a Carbon Offset Referral Suite that provides US corporate clients with a curated list of carbon offset providers who can help them manage their footprint via offset solutions that include investments in large scale carbon removal and reduction projects and avoidance projects.

Funding: In May 2022, American Express closed our first ever ESG bond issuance.

An amount equivalent to the net proceeds of the 1 billion ESG bond will be allocated toward projects in the Green and Social Categories, informed by the American Express Sustainable Financing Framework.

Green projects include those related to green buildings, energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy, and the circular economy.

Social projects include initiatives connected to socioeconomic advancement and empowerment, access to essential services, and affordable housing.

Achieved carbon neutral operations for Scope 1 (direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by American Express), Scope 2 (indirect market based emissions), and Scope 3 (waste and employee business travel, including third party air, rail, and rental cars) emissions through renewable energy credits, carbon offsets, and reduced GHG emissions.

Operations include all our managed facilities, field sites, and data centers.

Managed facilities are individual properties operationally managed by our global real estate team and housing critical business functions.

Field sites are individual properties that are not operationally managed by our global real estate team but directly by our business units.

They are typically smaller sites, less than 30,000 square feet (including airport lounges, foreign exchange kiosks, and sales offices) that are owned or leased by American Express.

Green building certified percentage is represented by the total year end square footage certified out of total year end building square footage.

This includes leased or owned facilities actively occupied by American Express (excluding parking lot square footage) that have achieved certification under a global or locally recognized third party environmental building certification system as meeting their performance criteria (LEED, BREEAM, NABERS, GreenMark, HQE, and Effinergie ).

American Express’ Carbon Footprint Tool calculations are derived by applying selected conversion factors to spending made with the following American Express Corporate products: Corporate Card, Business Travel Account, Corporate Meeting Card, Corporate Purchasing Card, Buyer Initiated Payments, vPayments and Amex Go.

Our ESG governance framework, Advance Climate Solutions pillar of our ESG strategy, and qualitative climate risk scenario analyses demonstrate our progress to enhance climate risk management and opportunities across our business.

We committed to net zero by 2035 in alignment with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and selected this goal based on SBTi’s most ambitious level of climate action, to limit global warming to 1.5 C above pre industrial levels.

We leverage science based frameworks including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and International Energy Agency (IEA), to inform our climate related risk identification process across short , medium , and long term horizons.

We aim to minimize our climate impact and manage our climate related risks and opportunities enable our customers and partners to transition to a low carbon economy through the development of new capabilities and support community programs and initiatives to help build more climate resilient and equitable communities.

For our qualitative climate related physical risk assessment, we evaluated potential threats and mitigation opportunities to critical business sites across our global operations, supply chain, and revenue sources both under historic conditions and applied to future climate projections from the IPCC’s Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario.

Each site was examined for seven potential acute and chronic risks from the physical impacts of climate change: 1) increasing temperatures 2) sea level rise 3) precipitation changes 4) flooding 5) cyclonic events 6) extended drought and 7) extreme temperatures.

For the qualitative climate related transition risk assessment, we evaluated the impact of three future scenarios from the IEA compatible with a 1.5 C, 2 3 C, 6 C pathway on countries essential to our business operations against 2025 and 2040 time horizons.

The assessment evaluated the impact of transition risks to our potential future revenues and costs associated with capital expenditures and capital allocation strategies over short and long term horizons.

American Express management establishes risk management policies and procedures to identify, assess, measure, and manage key risks facing the company.

ESG risks, including, but not limited to, climate change risk are currently identified as an emerging risk within our risk governance framework.

Climate related risks are interconnected and overarching across all risk types as it may manifest as credit risk, operational risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and other risk types.

To identify and assess climate related risks, we conducted qualitative climate related physical and transition risk and opportunity assessments to understand the current and potential impacts of climate change to our direct business operations, supply chain, and financial activities.

We also consider current and emerging climate regulations, technology, legal, and reputational risks and qualitative factors such as disruptions to our operations, impacts on our colleagues, and damage to our brand.

ESG and climate related risks are managed as part of our comprehensive ERM program.

Risk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through its Risk Committee, Audit and Compliance Committee, and Compensation and Benefits Committee, each of which provide regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed by these committees.

These committees meet regularly with our Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance Ethics Officer, the Chief Audit Executive, Chief Operational Risk Officer, and other senior management with regards to our risk management processes, controls, talent, and capabilities to monitor our risk culture and emerging and strategic risks.

The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC) provides oversight of our Enterprise Risk Management framework, processes, and methodologies, and approves our Enterprise Risk Management policy, which governs risk governance, risk oversight, and risk appetite.

ESG risks in particular climate risk have been included as an emerging risk for the company and are part of our Enterprise Risk Management scope.

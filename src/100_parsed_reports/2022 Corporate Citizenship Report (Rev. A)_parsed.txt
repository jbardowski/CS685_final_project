Letter from the CEO

For decades, Texas Instruments has operated with a passion to 
create a better world by making electronics more affordable through 
semiconductors. With each generation, semiconductor technology 
has become smaller, more efficient and more affordable, and today, 
our products are helping customers to develop electronics and new 
applications that are contributing to a more sustainable future.

Our founders had the foresight to know that building a great company 
required a special culture to thrive for the long term. For many years, 
we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind:

•  First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. 

•  Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing. 

•  And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a 

part of and that we would want as our neighbor. 

With these ambitions guiding our decision-making for the long term 
and our products helping to create a better world, we are confident 
that our collective efforts will be impactful and long-lasting. We take 
great pride in our commitment to being a good corporate citizen, which 
impacts our communities and the world in two ways:

First, our ambitions guide how we run our business and are 
foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable, socially 
thoughtful and environmentally responsible manner. Central to these 
ambitions is a belief that in order for all stakeholders to benefit, the 
company must grow stronger over the long term. 

Second, semiconductors will play a critical role in creating a better 
world and helping to reduce the impact on the environment.

As engineers, we are fortunate to work on exciting technology 
that helps our customers innovate to create a better world. Our 
semiconductor products are powering sustainable technology around 
the world, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy applications, 
and helping to make a positive impact in a growing number of ways.

In 2022, despite the ongoing global challenges related to the 
pandemic and resulting supply chain disruptions, TI maintained a 
focus on keeping our employees safe, keeping our factories running, 
adding capacity to support customer demand and giving back to our 
communities when needs continued to be great. 

I am proud of how TIers adapted and performed in 2022. We have 
learned through the decades that challenging years are when our 
ambitions are most critical in guiding our decisions and when TIers rise 
to the challenge.

You can count on us to stay true to our ambitions: to think like owners 
for the long term, adapt and succeed in a world that’s ever changing 
and behave in a way that makes our stakeholders proud. When we’re 
successful, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders 
all win.

Report overview

Since 2006, TI has published program information, goals, progress on goals 
and relevant data – including a focus on environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) and sustainability priorities – as part of its commitment to being a good 
corporate citizen. 

As with previous years, our 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report provides insight 
into how we think about – and how we perform – in various ESG areas relevant 
to our business using these widely accepted reporting frameworks: 

•  The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)2 

•  The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)3 

•  The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)4 

In addition, we participate in the CDP5 Climate Change and Water Security 
questionnaires and make both available at TI.com/ccr. 

To strengthen our reporting, we solicit input from internal and external 
stakeholders year-round, examine third-party sustainability assessments and 
benchmark trends and best practices. We then compare these inputs to our 
company priorities to determine what topics and disclosures to include in our 
annual Corporate Citizenship Report. 

Our commitment to corporate citizenship 

We take great pride in being a good corporate citizen, which impacts our 
communities and the world in two ways: 

•  First, our ambitions guide how we run our business and are foundational 

to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable, socially thoughtful and 
environmentally responsible manner. Central to these ambitions is a belief that 
in order for all stakeholders to benefit, the company must grow stronger over 
the long term.

•  Second, semiconductors will play a critical role in creating a better world and 

helping reduce environmental impacts.

2The GRI is an independent, international organization that helps businesses take responsibility for their impacts by providing them with a global common language to communicate those impacts.
3The Financial Stability Board established the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures that could promote more informed investment, credit and insurance underwriting decisions.
4The SASB is an independent nonprofit organization that sets standards to guide companies' disclosure of sustainability information to their investors.

Reducing environmental impact

TI takes great pride in being a good corporate citizen and has a long-standing commitment to responsible, 
sustainable manufacturing. We produced our first Corporate Citizenship Report in 2006, and we remain committed 
to our long-term environmental sustainability programs of conserving natural resources, reducing greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions and mitigating climate change.

As a semiconductor company that manufactures billions of chips per year, we believe that it is important to drive 
efficiencies in our fabrication process. Multi-year sustainability goals guide our work (see the next page), and we 
strive to efficiently manufacture chips to reduce energy use, GHG emissions, water use and the generation of 
landfill waste. 

TI semiconductor products are and will increasingly play a critical role in helping reduce the impact on the 
environment. Our semiconductors are helping customers to develop smaller, more efficient and affordable 
technology that makes electrification, renewable energy and energy storage solutions possible.

2022 per-chip efficiency improvements

For more than a decade, TI has driven efficiencies in its fabrication processes and equipment 
to reduce environmental impacts. We measure and track normalized, or per-chip data, for GHG 
emissions, energy, water and material consumption as a way of assessing the overall resource 
efficiency of our manufacturing process. 

By comparing normalized data, we can account for the resources and emissions associated with 
the production of a single chip and see how that has improved over time. When comparing our 
per-chip data from 2010 to 2022, we have significantly reduced manufacturing-related impacts 
and resource consumption.

Progress 

2010-2022: Per-chip efficiency improvements

Over the past several years, TI has made progress in conserving energy and water, reducing energy consumption 
per chip, diverting landfill waste and working toward our long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and scope 2 absolute 
GHG emissions by 25% from a 2015 base year by 2025. 

In 2022, we experienced slight year-over-year increases in consumption and emissions as TI’s production increased. 
This was because of continued customer demand throughout the year, and ramping two new 300-millimeter 
factories in Richardson, Texas, and Lehi, Utah.

Despite our operational growth, we remain committed to reducing our environmental impact. We invest in 
hundreds of projects every year aimed at reducing that impact, such as using advanced manufacturing tools 
and technologies; signing multiyear solar and wind power contracts to deliver renewable electricity in Texas; and 
installing a solar roof at our site in Bangalore, India.

8TI’s 2015 GHG emissions baseline was adjusted in the 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report to reflect structural changes to our operations, including the divestiture of a wafer fabrication plant in Scotland and the acquisition of a 300-mm wafer fabrication plant in Utah. The    
 2015 baseline has been adjusted from 2,471,357 to 2,832,709 MTCO2e in line with the guidance provided by the WBCSD/WRI’s The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.
9TI has not included fluorinated heat transfer fluids (FHTF) in previous Corporate Citizenship Reports due to the varying calculation methodologies and guidance. Under current World Semiconductor Council (WSC) reporting guidance, the association that tracks semiconductor
 emissions, there is no requirement to track and report FHTF. Recently introduced U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules for disclosure to the EPA included FHTF and we comply with this requirement. Recently, the WSC has aligned on all regions will moving to  
 2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidance, which includes FHTF. TI is considering the timing of a transition to the 2019 IPCC guidance and will include FHTF emissions upon adoption.
10ERM Certification and Verification Services (CVS) provided limited assurance verification of TI's scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions for 2022. 

TI faces potential risks and opportunities associated with climate 
change, which are described in detail in its TI's 2023 CDP Climate 
Change response. Our CDP response, the Emissions section of the GRI 
Index and our TCFD Index also contain information about our climate 
change-related governance and management strategies. 

Performance

As of year-end 2022, TI’s scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions were down 
23% since 2015. For additional GHG data, see our Performance

Our commitment to reducing energy intensity per chip

Performance

TI's global operations, and design, manufacturing, assembly and 
test sites focus on lowering energy consumption and associated 
GHG emissions by setting annual reduction goals and implementing 
efficiency projects. TI has a goal to reduce energy use per chip11 by 
50% at worldwide manufacturing sites by year-end 2025 from a 2015 
base year. We have progressed 28% toward this goal at the end of 202212.

Because of increased production, TI consumed 3.75 TWh of energy in 
2022, up from 3.19 TWh in 2021. For additional energy data, see our 
Performance Data Appendix.

For more information about how TI manages energy use, see the Energy 
section of the GRI Index.

Renewable energy

TI is committed to increasing renewable energy use in the coming 
years as part of its GHG emissions reduction goal. TI secures 
reliable energy supplies, including renewable resources where 
available, that are cost-effective and align with business needs 
and objectives.

Actions we are taking

TI implements more than 200 projects each year to reduce 
energy throughout its operations. These have helped us conserve 
320-gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy over the last five years, even as 
our production increased by 25% during the same period. 

We focus most of our efforts on our manufacturing operations because 
they account for over 90% of our total energy use. Other ways we save 
energy include: 

•  Designing and operating buildings and fabrication sites to optimize 

efficiency and achieve LEED certification. 

•  Upgrading and refurbishing tools and equipment. 

•  Using sensors and other automated controls. 

•  Improving control and optimizing set points of our chilled 

water plants. 

•  Installing energy-efficient LED lighting, fans and drive mechanisms 

for our air-handling systems.

Managing wastewater

TI has a particular focus on using water responsibly and efficiently. 
Conserving processed and potable water and treating and recycling 
wastewater enables us to reduce costs and promote long-term 
availability. We maintain and optimize our wastewater treatment 
systems to comply with regulations and permit limits. 

In 2022, we implemented water reduction projects that saved an 
annualized amount of water equal to 3.2% of our 2021 usage versus 
our goal of 3.4%.

Conserving water

Over the last five years, we conserved nearly 886.1 
million gallons of water.

Annually, TI implements projects to reduce overall water use 
throughout its operations. To improve water efficiency, TI: 

•  Invests in reduction, recycling and reuse projects.

•  Optimizes the efficiency of deionized water plants, improving the 

recovery rates of reverse-osmosis filters. 

TI has internal standards, programs and procedures to ensure that 
wastewater produced by all sites complies with local, state and 
national discharge requirements. Parameters evaluated by each site 
are standard for the semiconductor industry and typically include 
biological oxygen demand, total suspended solids, metals, pH 
and temperature. We also: 

•  Reduces manufacturing tool water use by optimizing flow rates and 

•  Restrict or remove substances such as metals, toxic organic 

identifying where to reuse water in other processes.

•  Uses additional microfilters and ultrafilters to recover 

more wastewater.

•  Maximizes the amount of condensate and microfiltration water 

directed to cooling towers.

•  Purifies and recycles higher-quality production water back to the 

inputs of ultra-pure water plants.

Monitoring water quality

We regularly monitor water withdrawal quality at our manufacturing 
facilities and conduct regular testing to maintain internal standards. 
Our manufacturing facilities also track water discharge quality by 
standard effluent parameters.

compounds, nitrates and sulfides from wastewater 
before discharge.

•  Collect wastewater sludge containing solvents, concentrated 

metals or acid solutions and dispose of them off-site per regulatory 
requirements. In some cases, we send these compounds to 
reclamation facilities for reuse by other industries.

•  Conduct required wastewater sampling to ensure operation within 

our permit limits.

Performance

While overall water use increased by 19% over 2021 as production 
increased to support our customers, we conserved more than 174 
million gallons and reused 25%, or nearly 2.2 billion gallons, of all water 
consumed. For additional water data, see our Performance Data Appendix.

Managing chemicals and gas use

Transparency on material content

TI responsibly manages the use and disposal of materials and 
chemicals to protect the environment and reduce landfill waste. TI aims 
to divert 90% of materials from landfills to reduce environmental impacts.

Manufacturing semiconductors involves using hazardous and 
nonhazardous chemicals and gases, which is why TI’s product-
management systems have stringent controls in place. We continually:  

We give customers documents and tools that outline measures 
we take to ensure that our products comply with global material 
restrictions and regulations. These include: 

Actions we are taking

We properly dispose of waste and materials that we cannot recycle or 
reuse according to applicable federal, state and local laws, and make every 
effort to: 

Step 1: Examine what we need.

Most of the materials we need are for fabricating semiconductors. 
When purchasing materials and chemicals, we consider the resulting 
waste, and whether an opportunity exists to reuse existing materials, 
purchase recycled materials or use environmentally friendly items instead. 

Step 2: Reuse what we can.

We reuse materials and chemicals by: 

•  Recovering metals from solids, liquids, scrap wafers and 

other materials.

•  Repurposing and reselling used and surplus chemicals, chemical 

containers and older manufacturing equipment.

•  Reusing wafer carriers and food service tableware.

Step 3: Recycle what is allowed.

Our recyclable material and chemicals come primarily from our offices 
and manufacturing sites. These are managed and regulated differently 
depending on local requirements.

•  Identify and use the safest, lowest-risk materials in operations to 
protect TIers, site communities and consumers. Where possible, 
we use high-pressure water instead of chemicals in certain cleanup 
applications or replace chemicals with environmentally 
benign substitutes. 

•  Screen all incoming materials and chemicals before incorporating 
them into semiconductor manufacturing processes to comply with 
regulatory and customer requirements. We also incorporate any 
chemical restrictions and standards into supplier contracts. 

•  Assess potential environmental, safety and health (ESH) impacts of 
materials as new scientific information becomes available and new 
regulations go into effect. 

•  Controlled Chemical and Materials Specifications.

•  TI-restricted chemicals and materials.

•  TI’s approach to environmental and product stewardship.

•  A search tool to find material content; download restricted chemical 

test reports; or locate products’ RoHS, REACH and green status.

•  Quality, reliability and packaging data.

•  Lead-free conversions.

•  Low Halogen (Green) Statement.

•  Environmental FAQs.

•  Follow strict standards and protocols for responsibly purchasing, 

transporting, tracking and disposing of chemicals safely. 

Performance 

•  Provide specific procedures and training for the use, labeling, 
storage and disposal of chemicals or hazardous substances, 
including the proper use of personal protective equipment. 

•  Use ventilation controls, abatement systems, leak detectors and 

appropriate treatment technologies. 

If concerns about a material or chemical arise during our screening 
process, we elevate the matter to our review board, comprising internal 
subject-matter experts. If a material or chemical is necessary for 
manufacturing but still raises concerns, our manufacturing leaders 
review the situation and, if necessary, seek a safer alternative or 
implement more stringent use controls.

We diverted 90% of the 50,673 metric tons of waste and surplus 
materials generated in 2022 from landfills, meeting our goal.

We achieved this by reusing and recovering chemicals where viable; 
selling surplus chemicals; recycling certain waste for use in energy 
recovery; and recycling scrap wood, paper, glass, metals and organic 
materials. For additional data, see our Performance Data Appendix. 

See the Materials section of the GRI Index for more information about 
how TI manages materials.

Product quality

Our commitment to quality and support 

Quality and reliability permeate every corner of TI 

Product longevity 

TI’s holistic approach to quality permeates every aspect of the 
company’s supply chain, from process technology and design through 
manufacturing, packaging, testing and delivery. We continuously 
improve our products and process technologies to deliver high-quality, 
reliable semiconductor solutions that meet our customers’ needs. 

To reduce environmental impacts and extend product longevity, we 
optimize the quality and reliability of our technologies. We measure 
customer returns, which assess our performance on both resolution 
cycle times and return parts per billion. These measures help maintain 
high levels of customer service and product quality and reliability. 

To drive continuous improvement, we assess, categorize and 
aggregate the reason for each return to identify systemic improvement 
opportunities. More than 85% of TI products have yet to have a single 
customer return in three years.

Actions we are taking

Quality and reliability 

Every organization within TI works together to ensure quality and 
deliver reliable products. We continuously improve our products 
and process technologies to build reliable technologies that meet 
stringent quality standards for industrial (Joint Electron Device 
Engineering Council) and automotive (Automotive Electronics Council 
Q100) products. We use specialized materials and controls to build 
high-quality products, test silicon and package technologies and 
continuously monitor wafer-level reliability. 

When we start product qualification, we aim to have high, data-
backed confidence that the product is fully reliable and will meet our 
customers’ long-term quality needs. 

TI leverages various strategies to maintain quality and reliability. For 
example, our:

•  Quality System Manual describes quality-management processes 

and systems. 

To maintain product longevity and continuity of supply for our 
customers, we have life-cycle management policies and inventory and 
manufacturing strategies that enable us to sell and support products 
for a decade or more. 

TI’s product life cycles are typically 10 to 15 years and often extend 
longer, consistent with many customers’ requirements. We are 
committed to product longevity for our customers and have strategies 
and internal policies to uphold this commitment.

•  Quality policy and procedures provide a framework to identify and 

resolve quality issues quickly. We incorporate industry requirements 
and standards, along with customer specifications and feedback, to 
mitigate risks and drive improvement throughout a product’s 
life cycle. 

•  Internal quality standards help us comply with numerous industry 

standards and quality specifications, including International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 
45001, International Standard for Automotive Quality Management 
Systems 16949 and the Underwriters Laboratories rating. 

•  Reliability testing enhances or accelerates potential failure 

mechanisms, helps identify the root cause and reveals how to 
prevent failure modes.

We measure several product and service quality performance 
indicators to make continuous improvements.

Product logistics

TI strives to pack and ship products efficiently to assure timely distribution to customers, comply with international shipping 
regulations and reduce environmental impact. 

Actions we are taking 

Our product distribution centers (PDCs) are mindful of plastic consumption and are giving plastic dunnage a second life as packaging 
for outbound shipments when feasible. We reuse and recycle various materials to cut down on packaging waste. 

For example, we: 

•  Pack large quantities of products into each shipment to eliminate multiple deliveries. We also increase packing density to move 

actual weights closer to charged dimensional weights. 

•  Use air pillows in packaging that are recyclable, reusable and contain recycled content. Some of our PDCs use shredded cardboard 

dunnage made from discarded boxes to protect contents.

•  Work with our customers to understand their delivery needs and ship in bulk when possible. This practice enables us to ship 

mutually agreed-upon low-priority freight when space becomes available on more affordable shipping options. 

•  Require that suppliers ship all new 300-mm wafers in reusable containers. When empty, we return these containers to the supplier 

for reuse or use them internally. 

•  Reuse packing materials that protect products during shipment (such as bubble packs and foam); shipping materials (such 

as boxes, crates and pallets); cases that ship precious-metal reclaimable items to suppliers; and plastic reels used in product 
distribution. We reuse bubble wrap from our Education Technology business unit as dunnage for TI.com shipments. 

•  Comply with the European Union (EU) Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment and EU Packaging and Packaging Waste recycling 

programs for evaluation modules imported into that region. 

•  Place our PDCs in regions close to customers to accelerate delivery times, improve efficiency and facilitate product deliveries in the 

event of a disaster. 

•  Eliminate heavy and expensive custom-cut foam, nonrecyclable foam, and foam and cardboard waste. 

•  Use reusable metal containers instead of shipping boxes at some of our PDCs to eliminate plastic and cardboard waste. 

See the Marketing and Labeling section of the GRI Index for more information about how TI manages product content labeling.

PDC team members Danielle, Fernando and John led a pilot project at our Alliance PDC in North Texas to reduce the use of 
plastic packaging material by replacing it with recycled cardboard shredded into a lattice pattern.

Governance

At TI, we believe good corporate governance is important to our long-term success. 
We’ve had written governance guidelines since 1973, refining them over the years to 
meet company and shareholders’ needs. 

About TI’s board of directors 

Our ambitions and core values are integral to building TI stronger, and we demonstrate 
responsible and ethical business practices by adhering to our stated principles. 

At year-end 2022, TI had a unitary board system with 12 board members, including 10 independent directors, whose leadership and 
diverse backgrounds bring a vast amount of experience and knowledge to our company.

Board of directors

TI's board of directors is dedicated to responsible and effective corporate governance 
and oversees the company's global business strategy. It includes three committees – 
the audit committee, the compensation committee and the governance and stockholder 
relations committee. 

The board discusses its governance practices annually to ensure they truly make sense 
for TI in today's business climate. Where ESG-related issues may have significance 
for TI, these matters are reviewed with the relevant committee. For example, the audit 
committee reviews the company’s practices with respect to risk assessment and risk 
management, specifically including environmental-related risks. The governance and 
stockholder relations committee also oversees ESG matters in connection with its 
responsibility to review public issues of interest to company stakeholders.

Ethics and compliance 

Our founders had the foresight to know that building a great company required a special culture to thrive for the 
long term. At TI, we refer to culture as Living Our Values – ambitions, values and code of conduct, and it’s how we 
operate daily. 

Our Code of Conduct

Every TIer plays a critical role in upholding these principles, which we reinforce through leader involvement, 
employee engagement and training. 

We expect each TI employee to understand our code of conduct, which translates our ambitions and 
values into the standards we must uphold and provides clarity about the behaviors we will not tolerate.

Actions we are taking

We provide TIers, managers, and leaders the training and tools they need to help them make the right decisions, 
do business the right way and build a stronger company for the long term. 

When a TIer sees behaviors inconsistent with our ambitions, values, code of conduct or policies, it is 
their responsibility to speak up. They can do so by talking to a manager or human resources, or by 
contacting the TI Ethics department directly or anonymously.

Every employee receives ethics and compliance training. The topics may vary, but over a multi-year cycle, 
they include TI’s code of conduct, environmental, safety and health (ESH), confidential information protection, 
information technology security, avoiding workplace and sexual harassment, and other compliance topics.

Direct contact:

•  Email ethics@ti.com

•  Write to P.O. Box 830801, Richardson, TX 75083-0801

Additionally, we train employees in specific roles in human rights policies, export compliance, anti-corruption, 
insider trading, global competition law and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct. 

We also engage managers on what it means to live our values and uphold our standards of ethical conduct by 
providing tools to reinforce our culture and ethics and compliance expectations within their organizations.

Public policy

TI has well-established policies and practices that facilitate lawful participation by the company and 
employees in the political process. These policies and practices define the activities we engage in and the 
responsibilities and practices of our political action committee (PAC). 

We advocate for policies that help us attract talent, drive innovation and promote competitiveness. Our 
specific areas of policy interest include tax, trade, talent and racial equity. To these ends, we collaborate 
with various U.S. and international industry associations on policy objectives. We are more active in some 
organizations than others and may not align on all positions. 

TI’s PAC is 100% employee-funded, regulated, transparent and nonpartisan. The TI PAC enables certain 
employees to voluntarily join together to support federal, state and local political candidates whose positions 
align with the company’s business objectives.

We provide additional information and disclosures on TI.com about the company’s political activities, TI’s 
PAC, the political activity of employees, and related policies and expectations.

Supply chain responsibility 

TI requires suppliers to share its commitment to responsible and fair 
business practices throughout the supply chain. We will not knowingly 
engage with a supplier that violates our values or requirements.

We primarily buy materials for fabrication processes; factory equipment 
and maintenance; logistics services; and nonproduction supplies and 
services from approximately 8,600 suppliers of various types and sizes. 
We seek suppliers that help us scale as we grow; reduce total costs and 
waste; improve efficiencies; and deliver innovative services, materials 
and product support.

Our worldwide procurement team coordinates the buying of goods 
and services, sets procurement strategies, identifies and vets qualified 
suppliers, negotiates terms and pricing and determines the best 
fulfillment methods. 

Responsible sourcing

TI invests in driving sustainable and responsible business practices 
throughout its supply chain to mitigate business, labor and 
environmental risks. For example, we:

•  Collect and carefully consider a supplier’s human rights practices and 

environmental and safety records before purchasing. 

Requirements and expectations

Our supplier website includes TI’s business requirements and standards 
for safe working conditions, labor and human rights protection, 
environmentally responsible operations and ethical behavior. We 
communicate these standards in our Supplier Code of Conduct, Supplier 
Ethics Expectations, Supplier Environmental and Social Responsibility 
Policy, Anti-Human Trafficking Statement and other governing documents.

As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), an industry 
coalition dedicated to corporate social responsibility in global supply 
chains, TI also complies with the standards outlined in the RBA Code 
of Conduct. 

Supplier diversity

In the U.S., we actively pursue business opportunities with minority- and 
women-owned business enterprises (MWBEs) to drive economic equity 
and provide the company with unique, innovative, cost-effective products 
and services. 

Each year, we set spending goals based on the types of projects we have 
planned and the availability of qualified vendors. In 2022, we spent more 
than $325 million with diverse U.S. suppliers.

•  Specify performance requirements and expectations in our policies, 

Business continuity

contracts and purchase orders. 

•  Engage with industry groups such as the Semiconductor Industry 

Association and Semiconductor Equipment and Materials 
International to discuss supply chain best practices and standards.

TI continually assesses risks to its supply chain, including financial health 
and concentration in geographic areas, to ensure that procurement and 
management processes are rigorous enough to prevent or manage 
reputational issues, order fulfillment problems, shipping delays or 
increased costs. For more information about risk factors, see page 9 of 
our SEC Form 10-K.

We require that suppliers maintain a business continuity plan in the event 
of a business interruption and make the contents of such plans available 
to us upon request. We also require that suppliers communicate with 
TI and implement their business continuity plan within 24 hours of a 
triggering incident to maintain supply continuity. 

Assessment

We prioritize the suppliers we examine based on our financial investment, 
criticality, products and services they provide and their geographic 
location. Additionally, independent third-party auditors evaluate select 
TI facilities each year against the RBA’s Validated Assessment Program 
protocol standards. We make these reports available to our customers. 

We also conduct regular audits to evaluate employment contracts, 
working hours and dormitory conditions. For more information about our 
assessment processes, see our Anti-Human Trafficking Statement. 

Performance

In 2022, we evaluated nearly 230 suppliers, which included 160 
production suppliers that support our manufacturing operations with 335 
factory locations; 98% of all suppliers assessed met our performance 
expectations. The remaining 2% required corrective actions, which 
included additional training or enhanced policies. 

Regardless of a supplier’s respective risk rating, we require any supplier 
with actual or potential risks (such as those related to hiring activity, 
working hours, and wages and benefits) to take corrective actions. We 
monitor these actions through to completion.

Responsible minerals

TI has processes to ensure that its products do not contain minerals derived from sources that finance or benefit armed groups 
in the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. These minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TG). TI has 
started taking steps to disclose the use of cobalt in its supply chain.

Actions we are taking

We work diligently with our supply chain, including subcontracted manufacturers, to identify and eliminate non-conformant material 
sources. Our standard operating procedures for conflict minerals supply chain management conform with the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development’s Due Diligence Guidance, which requires establishing policies, structures and procedures, 
risk management and communication mechanisms. 

We distribute our Conflict Minerals Policy to our suppliers and expect their full and prompt response to our information requests. 

Tracing chain of custody

To gain insight into the country of origin, chain of custody and status of conflict minerals in our supply chain, we rely primarily on the 
findings of the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). 

RMAP is a program in which an independent third party evaluates smelters’ management systems and procurement practices and 
determines whether the smelter has demonstrated that it is conformant with the applicable RMAP standard. It is overseen by the 
Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which was established by members of the RBA and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative. 

TI is a member of the RBA and working groups participating in both the RMI and the Responsible Labor Initiative. 

Performance 

Our research and information gathering show that in 2022, the suppliers in our supply chain for integrated circuits used 3TG minerals 
originating exclusively from conformant smelters.

hours and pay are fair and consistent with local labor standards and 
laws. We forbid the use of child labor in our operations and throughout 
our supply chain.

Employees have the freedom to associate, the right to collective 
bargaining or both, as provided by local statute. We regularly conduct 
global employee surveys and virtual and in-person roundtable 
discussions to understand site-specific work environments better. 

Further, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets the same expectations of 
our suppliers and their suppliers to commit to the same principles and 
to uphold human rights, ethical practices and provide a safe 
work environment.

Actions we are taking 

We monitor human rights risks and eliminate violations by: 

•  Conducting periodic risk assessments and due diligence with 

suppliers using the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.  

•  Conducting third-party audits, on-site interviews and assessments 
in high-risk geographies to ensure the protection of employees’ and 
contractors’ rights.  

•  Assessing labor standards, delivering training and awareness-
building practices, and providing incident-reporting tools.

Risk management and business continuity

TI   continuously monitors, plans and trains for both unanticipated and 
emerging operational risks, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, 
extreme weather events, pandemics, geopolitical issues, social unrest, 
terrorism, or supply-chain or product-distribution delays.

Our internally owned and regionally diverse manufacturing footprint 
includes 12 wafer fabrication plants, seven assembly and test sites, 
and multiple bump and probe facilities across 15 sites worldwide. In 
addition to our internal capacity, we have strong partnerships with 
external foundries and subcontractors to offer supply continuity. 

Actions we are taking

We mitigate disruptions to our business by: 

•  Monitoring risks, developing and modifying plans to address those 

risks, and training employees on crisis response. 

•  Assessing changes to environmental conditions, supply continuity, 

and the global regulatory and political landscape.

•  Operating a 24/7 year-round security communication center. 

•  Owning much of our manufacturing to provide customers with a 

greater assurance of supply and geopolitically dependable capacity. 

•  Building and positioning inventory globally at product distribution 

centers that are strategically located close to customers.

Responding to emergencies

Preparing for various scenarios 

Depending on the nature and severity of an incident, we activate 
our emergency response system. Our emergency response team 
assembles to quickly identify the appropriate resources, services and 
infrastructure required to mitigate potential losses and coordinate our 
response and communications.

Conducting business modeling, scenario and impact analysis to 
develop and refine management strategies, policies and standards, and 
contingency plans helps us determine: 

•  Critical business processes that make up our operations and the 

people accountable for ensuring their viability. 

•  Possible threats and risks, and whether controls are in place to 

manage them. 

•  Process recovery times to ensure that we respond and recover 

As a global corporation, TI faces unexpected global events that 
occur without warning, from earthquakes and pandemics to severe 
weather events. The impact of these types of incidents can be minimal 
or substantial. When challenges arise, we aim to prevent human, 
environmental, financial and reputational effects while maintaining 
production and distribution. 

Our business continuity and emergency response planning include 
creating realistic scenarios and guiding leadership teams through various 
exercises to learn, refine and improve our responses to actual incidents. 
Our business continuity management framework is modeled after the ISO 
22301 business continuity management standard, which helps us plan, 
implement, monitor and protect against business interruptions. 

To engage our leaders in enterprise risk planning, we regularly: 

efficiently and with the right resources. 

•  Teach them how to assess and prioritize risks based on severity and 

•  Contingency strategies for all critical business processes that pose 

a high risk to people, revenue and reputation. 

•  Comprehensive recovery strategies to cover all aspects of response 
and recovery, prioritizing the continuation of products and services. 

Our Readiness 2 Recover program helps us measure the effectiveness 
of and compliance with our business continuity management requirements. 
Every two years (or as needed), we conduct risk assessments to identify and 
rectify existing controls and gaps.

potential impact on our people or products. 

•  Ask them to evaluate and update contingency strategies based on 

lessons learned from either real events or scenario-based exercises. 

•  Conduct drills, training, tabletop exercises and site-level exercises to 

prepare for unforeseen events.

Information protection 

TI works continuously to identify and eliminate potential threats to its employees, customers, IT infrastructure, proprietary technologies and confidential information. This 
protection is key to business growth and profitability, and maintaining compliance with relevant regulations. 

Reducing cybersecurity risks

Our cybersecurity risk-management process is based on best practice management and governance frameworks, such as the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls. We leverage foundational 
cybersecurity principles in our program, such as security by design, defense-in-depth, least privilege and resilience-focused backups to manage risk. 

Using guidance from these organizations and information collected from our assessments, we develop cybersecurity plans, policies and protocols to reduce our risks 
and strengthen our security posture to protect our company, technology and intellectual property (IP). Our policies include defining the acceptable use of our information 
assets, access requirements for specific IP or technologies, protecting personal information and privacy, and complying with regulations such as the EU General Data 
Protection Regulation and the China Cybersecurity Law. 

Actions we are taking

Our global information security team identifies and responds to potential threats and works with our business units and support teams to improve security.  
As part of this, we take these types of actions:

Protect

Working at TI 

Our passion is to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. 

We were pioneers in the world’s transition from vacuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits (ICs) – 
and we’ve been advancing IC technology and the ability to reliably produce ICs in high volumes for decades. 

Each generation of innovation builds upon the last to make technology smaller, more efficient, more reliable and 
more affordable. Our innovations are at work all around you in things you experience every day, from connected 
cars to intelligent homes, from drones to smartphones. 

Texas Instruments awards and rankings

In 2022, TI was awarded 30-plus honors and recognitions around the world. These awards recognized our 
focus on creating a diverse and inclusive workplace, developing TIers, committing to our sustainability 
progress and building opportunities to launch careers. Each award represents our commitment to living 
our values and pride in our company.

At TI, we bring together 33,000 of the world’s smartest people – problem solvers known simply as TIers – who are 
committed to shaping the future of electronics. 

We ensure that our passion is a lasting reality by operating with three ambitions in mind: 

•  We will act like owners who will own the company for decades.

•  We will adapt and succeed in an ever-changing world.

•  We will be a company that we’re personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor.

When we successfully achieve these ambitions, our people, customers, communities and shareholders all win.

Diversity and inclusion 

We are different by design, and believe that our diverse backgrounds 
and perspectives make TI’s products more innovative and our company 
stronger. We work to create an inclusive culture where we respect and 
encourage ideas, and where our people know that they can succeed 
and build long-term careers.

Our commitment to an inclusive environment focuses on three 
strategic priorities: 

•  Building diverse representation at all levels.

•  Creating a culture of inclusion and belonging.

•  Impacting the communities where we live and work.

Actions we are taking

TI has intentionally designed global inclusion programming around 
these priorities to reinforce that the company values every voice, and to 
encourage TIers to bring their full selves to work and share their ideas.

Reducing bias in our processes 

We are focused on reducing bias within our processes when 
interviewing candidates, reviewing job performance, conducting talent 
reviews and making compensation and advancement decisions. 
We also make unconscious bias content available in performance 
management workshops and directly to TIers through our learning and 
development system. 

We further train leaders to understand and recognize unconscious 
bias and use objective criteria and feedback from multiple sources to 
assess professional growth and to gather independent feedback when 
assessing job performance.

Creating conversations that matter 

One of the ways that TI is co-creating an inclusive culture is through 
year-long group-based dialogue teams. These dialogue teams aim 
to build self-awareness by learning to identify personal and systemic 
barriers to inclusion and how to interrupt exclusionary behaviors and 
challenge stereotypes. 

Impacting change in our communities

Our ambition calls us to be a company that we’re personally proud to 
be a part of and would want as our neighbor. We support employees’ 
efforts to get involved in our communities by serving on nonprofit 
boards, participating in ongoing volunteering and giving campaigns to 
create more inclusive communities, and working to spread awareness 
and education throughout the year.

Workforce representation

For decades, TI has remained committed to diversity and inclusion. While there is always more work to do, the progress we’ve made regarding diversity and inclusion is encouraging. 

Actions we are taking

We regularly assess our workforce relative to availability across gender, race and ethnic demographics to understand where we have gaps and where we need to place more emphasis to continue our progress toward  having diverse 
representation at all levels. Women and underrepresented minorities15 are not reflected in engineering majors and careers at the same levels as men and non-minorities. For this reason, we focus on growing the engineering pipeline 
through partnerships with high schools, universities and nonprofit organizations.

Employee resource groups  

TI's employee resource groups (ERGs) provide a community that promotes a sense of belonging through open 
dialogue, education, volunteerism, well-being, and professional development and business engagement opportunities. 

Each of our employee-led ERGs has goals and objectives that align with our company values and business 
objectives, with support from at least one TI executive sponsor. 

In 2022, ERGs advanced our diversity and inclusion strategy through four focus areas – career, company, culture 
and community. They hosted programs, panels and events that engaged TIers around the world. For example: 

•  The Women’s Employee Network championed various events, including a Women Growth Summit and 

technical ladder roundtables in India. These focused on career development, helping prepare, support, mentor 
and develop women at all levels.

•  The Indian Employee Network organized sessions focused on improving the quality of life and well-being of 

TIers. Through dozens of events, members received support throughout the pandemic, resources for parents 
and new meditation and breathing techniques to promote wellness.

•  The Christian, Muslim and Jewish Employee Networks held faith-based collaborative events, bringing together 

members from across TI to learn more about similarities across cultures and religions. 

•  The Black Employee Network (BEN) hosted programming such as a “Conversations with BEN” series to support 
Black TIers and their career progress, to discuss contemporary issues, and to build a networking community.

Read more about how TI champions diversity and inclusion on TI.com and see Diversity and Equal Opportunity in

TI Diversity Network

For more than 30 years, the TI Diversity Network has helped educate employees and elevate 
topics that matter to employees through 15 employee-led ERGs that include thousands of 
members. Every network is open to all TIers, and our company encourages employees to join a 
network and get involved. 

The Women’s Employee Network hosted programming for all TIers focusing on open dialogue, development and awareness during Women’s
History Month.

Recruitment 

TI's ability to grow and thrive depends on recruiting and retaining the best talent in the industry. The company 
takes a multifaceted approach to hiring employees with diverse experiences and backgrounds to drive innovation 
and growth. 

Actions we are taking

We actively engage and recruit top engineering and business students for internships and full-time positions 
through career fairs, information sessions, networking and career preparation events, and partnerships with 
various student associations. We work closely with local community colleges and high schools to recruit and

Talent development

At TI, we are dedicated to providing employees with the tools and 
resources they need to chart the course for their careers. We help TIers 
set aspirational goals and create personal development plans to map 
the skills they need to succeed. 

Actions we are taking

We encourage all employees to discuss development and performance 
with their managers at least three times a year to receive feedback, 
document progress and determine any necessary refinements. 

Additionally, we offer formal learning and development opportunities 
at all levels to help every TIer – new and experienced – continuously 
evolve. Employees can access our internal hiring and learning 
platforms at any time to explore careers and chart development paths 
or complete mandatory training and other learning modules. We also 
customize learning opportunities to facilitate professional growth from 
internships to retirement. 

Interns

Internships at TI provide an opportunity to put education into practice 
on interesting projects that matter. From day one, our interns receive 
hands-on, meaningful work that can make a real impact. 

Management 

We equip TIers to succeed in management by:  

•  Transitioning from individual contributor to manager to manager 

of managers.

•  Understanding their leadership impact, how they build 

relationships with key stakeholders, and how they create and 
communicate strategies. 

•  Building their technical and behavioral skills to advance careers 
broader, deeper and higher. About 60% of managers began their 
careers at TI and we have promoted 99% of executive-level leaders 
from within.

•  Recognizing and reducing unconscious bias.

Our internship program provides access to key leaders and enables 
each to network and learn from TIers at all company levels.

One of the unique aspects of TI’s compensation strategy is a global 
profit-sharing program that rewards TIers for contributions to the 
company’s financial success. TI makes payouts as a percentage of 
eligible earnings based on profitability each year. 

Our profit-sharing formula is based on profit from operations (PFO) 
and begins when TI reaches 10% PFO. The maximum payout is 20%, 
when PFO reaches 35%. All TIers receive a payout based on the same 
percentage of eligible earnings. Our profit-sharing plan has paid out at 
the maximum level possible for the last seven years, equating to a 20% 
bonus for all eligible employees. 

Retaining talent 

Retaining employees with institutional knowledge, as well as 
technical and operating expertise, is a top priority for TI. We take a 
multidisciplinary approach to retention by offering:

Our commitment to equitable pay

We have a long-standing practice to pay our employees fairly and 
equitably. TI maintains competitive and equitable compensation 
policies. We designed checks and balances into our compensation 
system, including conducting regular in-depth analyses, to ensure we 
achieve them. 

In 2022, TI retained a third party to conduct a separate compensation 
analysis examining gender and race pay parity (including base, and 
bonus pay and equity) that considered job type, job level and country. 
Our analysis confirmed that within the U.S. and worldwide, TI pays 
women as much as men. In the U.S., TI pays minorities as much as 
non-minorities. Globally, women make $1.015 for every $1.000 men 
earn. In the U.S., women make $1.002 for every $1.000 men earn, and 
minorities make $1.002 for every $1.000 non-minorities earn.

Competitive benefits

TI’s benefits programs vary by country according to local market 
practice. These programs can include medical, dental and vision plans; 
short- and long-term disability plans; and paid time off and retirement 
plans designed to adhere to local laws and regulations. Additionally, our 
expanded benefits support workplace inclusion and equality, and we are 
committed to creating an environment of respect by providing inclusive 
benefits that support the unique needs of TIers and their families.

Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and on-demand resources, 
which include:

•  Resources and referrals for childcare and elder care.

•  Confidential counseling sessions and tools to support well-being.

•  Concierge services for vacation planning, making reservations or 

other personal transactions.

To refine work-life program offerings, we engage employees and audit 
our programs annually to remain competitive and improve services. 

Parental leave

At TI, we believe in supporting our employees in all aspects of their 
lives, including the transition to parenthood. We offer parental leave 
benefits to all new parents, enabling them to take time off to bond with 
their new child and adjust to new demands in their lives. 

We are proud to be a family-friendly workplace and remain committed 
to supporting our employees throughout their parenthood journeys. Our 
U.S. parental leave benefits allow employees to take paid time away 
from work without worrying about financial or job security. This benefit 
extends to all employees, regardless of gender, sexual orientation or 
family structure.  

•  Competitive pay and benefits.

•  Tailored career development plans, mentoring programs and 

executive interaction to develop and encourage professional growth.

TI offers and encourages employees to take full advantage of various 
programs to reduce daily stressors that can interfere with well-being, 
workplace satisfaction and productivity, such as ongoing access to its 

In 2022, Glassdoor recognized TI in its annual Best Places 
to Work ranking for the company’s culture, atmosphere and 
great employees.

•  Connection to peers through our ERGs.

•  Unlimited opportunities to refine skills.

Our commitment to safe workplaces

Health 

Recordable case rate

TI invests in and incorporates safe and healthy practices and controls 
into its employees’ daily routines to help prevent workplace injuries 
and illnesses. 

TI’s safety goals include a days away, restricted or job transfer (DART) 
case rate of 0.08 or less and a recordable case rate of 0.20 or less.

Actions we are taking

Safety 

Our safety-oriented culture includes implementing safety requirements 
and best practices globally to provide employees with a safe and 
healthy work environment. 

To maintain one of the industry’s best safety records, we:  

•  Create and operate safe worksites. 

•  Maintain proper safety and ergonomic protocols and controls. 

•  Develop and maintain internal standards, which often exceed 

regulatory requirements.  

•  Design and build inherently safe buildings and engineer out 

equipment risks. 

•  Require relevant safety training. 

•  Provide personal protective equipment. 

•  Inspect our equipment. 

•  Continuously audit our processes to assess compliance 

and performance.

To reduce exposure to health risks, TI applies rigorous industrial 
hygiene standards that establish the minimum requirements necessary 
for the safe use and proper storage of hazardous chemicals and 
other materials. These standards include hazard communication and 
training, chemical labeling, and hazardous waste management. 

Additionally, we eliminate or limit the use of potentially harmful 
materials, install ventilation and isolation controls, and conduct general 
hygiene and individual assessments. The resources that we offer to 
TIers to take control of their health vary by country, depending on the 
extent of government health benefits available. 

In the U.S., we provide free on-site flu vaccines and preventive 
screening programs, fitness and nutrition programs, employee 
assistance programs, and counseling and education services. Our 
health management service provides coaching and oversight to 
improve the well-being of TIers who have experienced a significant 
medical event; have extended work absences; or are dealing with 
multiple diagnoses, treatments and providers. 

Our benefit advocacy service helps estimate the costs of medical 
procedures and assists with locating affordable and quality health providers. 

Performance

Our DART and recordable rates continue to be among the lowest in the 
U.S. semiconductor industry, according to the U.S. Occupational Health 
and Safety Administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

In 2022, TI’s DART rate was 0.18 while the 2021 industry average was 
0.7 (2022 industry data is not yet available).

Giving

One of our three ambitions is to be a company that we’re personally 
proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. For decades, TI 
has worked to build stronger communities where the company operates. 

Our giving and volunteering programs:  

1.  Engage TIers globally through giving campaigns and 

   volunteering programs.

2.  Improve our global communities through contributions to          

  nonprofit organizations where TI operates.

3.  Combine monetary investments with employee involvement  

  for the greatest impact. 

We seek to improve the quality of life and strengthen our site 
communities across the globe. TI and the TI Foundation19 make 
well-considered and well-measured investments in several areas.

Philanthropic impact since 2010

Education

Racial equity

TI targets its largest area of philanthropic giving at improving 
education. Since 2010, the TI Foundation has invested more than $73 
million in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education 
to improve math and science learning outcomes and opportunities for 
Black, Latino and female students who historically face economic and 
educational barriers. Globally, we aim to improve access to educational 
resources in TI’s international site communities. 

Arts

We help sustain the arts that make Dallas culturally inclusive 
and vibrant through multi-year TI Foundation grants to premier 
organizations that emphasize the diversity of their outreach efforts and 
programming and through transformative grants to diverse groups that 
can become larger in scale and impact. 

We support programs that dismantle barriers to racial equity, 
emphasizing police training and practices that reinforce accountability 
so that all people are policed equitably and our communities are safer 
places to live and work.

Human services

We aim to strengthen programs and services for critical needs among 
racially and economically marginalized populations. We also preserve 
emergency funds for site communities and employees devastated by 
natural or human-caused disasters.

Matching gifts

To double the impact of U.S. employee giving, the TI Foundation 
matches active and retired employee donations of up to $30,000 per 
year to eligible nonprofit organizations. In 2022, the TI Foundation 
provided more than $11 million in matching gifts.

TIers across the globe embody the philanthropic spirit our company 
founders set for TI.  Their generosity – especially during a time when so 
many are in great need – is humbling, inspiring and gives us one more 
reason to be proud employees of Texas Instruments.

2022 giving highlights

Human services

Our company’s North Texas headquarters is located in one of the 
most prosperous regions in the U.S., but hunger is a problem for one 
in eight residents, driven by inflation. In response, the TI Foundation 
made a $300,000 grant to the North Texas Food Bank, helping provide 
approximately 1 million meals. The grant supported the food bank’s 
mission to nourish North Texas, including in Dallas, Collin and Grayson 
counties, where our company has large operations. 

Other notable support included more than $230,000 given by our 
employees and the TI Foundation – including matching gifts – to 
help the American Red Cross and its international affiliates provide 
humanitarian relief in Ukraine. TI also donated $150,000 to the China 
Youth Development Foundation in response to a 6.8 magnitude 
earthquake that struck the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan. 

Racial equity

The TI Foundation made a two-year, $250,000 grant to Project Unity for 
programs that aim to remove racial divides in North Texas. Programs 
focus on dialogue and trust-building between area law enforcement, 
youth and communities. The grant to Project Unity is the third 
investment by the TI Foundation as part of its commitment to support 
programs that dismantle barriers to racial equity.

Arts 

The TI Foundation awarded $1.3 million in grants to Dallas arts 
organizations to support their objective of sustaining the arts that 
make Dallas culturally inclusive. Recipients ranged from a new, 
experimental arts organization to long-standing partners that present a 
variety of cultural experiences that reflect the diversity in audiences  
and programming.

Education 

TI and the TI Foundation made $14 million in education grants, which 
included matching employee and retiree donations. With the evolving 
learning landscape and widening disparities in mind, the TI Foundation 
continued its 10 years of supporting public school districts in southern 
Dallas County through $4.7 million in funding.

We also furthered our two decades of support for the National Math 
and Science Initiative’s College Readiness Program, which serves 
four historically low-income public school districts in southern Dallas 
County and one in Utah that primarily serves Navajo tribal nation students. 

Investing in students' social and emotional wellness

A new $1 million grant built on the work that TI began in 2021 
with United Way of Metropolitan Dallas and Educate Texas on a 
“Heal, Play, Learn” program that addresses social and emotional 
wellness; physical activity; and arts engagement for students, 
teachers and families in southern Dallas County’s Cedar Hill and 
DeSoto public school districts.

The 2022 grant allowed those two districts to continue 
programming from 2021, during which 2,500 students, teachers 
and family members participated. Funding also enabled the 
program to expand into the Lancaster Independent School 
District, also in southern Dallas County.

While not specifically a STEM investment, the active learning 
components of Heal, Play, Learn align with Texas grade-level 
math and science requirements. They are also heavily focused 
on soft-skill STEM concepts, such as critical thinking, problem-
solving, creativity and collaboration. Districts reported improved 
teacher and student morale and higher enrollment by 5% for 
students who were part of the program vs. those who were not.

Volunteering

Our employees are passionate about giving back and improving the quality of life in their communities.

TI has more than 20 global community involvement teams and other civic-minded employees who work hard 
to solve local needs. Together, they mentor students, coach robotics competitions, volunteer at food banks and 
homeless shelters, clean up neighborhoods, plant trees and give valuable time to serve their communities in 
other ways. 

2022 contributions 

Volunteering programs brought TIers back together after the COVID-19 pandemic. At nearly 257,000 hours of 
employee and retiree time donated, the number of hours spent volunteering doubled from 2021 at a value20 of 
$7.7 million. In the U.S., the TI Foundation matches the value of employees’ volunteer hours up to $1,000 per year, 
which added almost $400,000 of additional support for their favorite causes. For example:

•  Food bank donations and other activities by TIers in Dallas, Taiwan, Japan and Maine addressed hunger.

•  Employee networks in Santa Clara and Dallas helped build bikes for impoverished children.

•  TIers at our manufacturing site in Lehi, Utah, distributed refurbished computers to area students through an 

e-waste recycling program.

•  Our community involvement teams in China, Malaysia and the Philippines focused their time on volunteering 
with children and at schools, painted murals, donated groceries to low-income families, and shared the joy of 
learning math and science.

For more information about how we manage community citizenship, see Local Communities in the GRI Index and 
Education Engagement. 

Living a legacy through community impact

Nathan – a wet process owner at TI’s Lehi, Utah, manufacturing site – was 
recognized with a 2022 TI Founders Community Impact Award, which the company 
bestows on TIers who have made outstanding contributions to the communities 
where they live and work. The biennial award honors our company’s founders and 
their long history of philanthropy and volunteerism. 

Nathan demonstrates a remarkable commitment to working with the unsheltered 
and hungry in the Salt Lake City area, which like many large U.S. cities is experiencing 
a rise in homeless populations. He received a $10,000 grant from TI to direct to a 
nonprofit organization of his choice. Five other finalists each received $2,500 in 
grants to direct to selected nonprofits.

“I serve this specific community because I was very close to losing my home and 
have been on food stamps before,” Nathan said. “I know how a safe home and 
knowing where your next meal will come from has a tremendous effect on the rest 
of your life. I believe every human has inherent value, and it is easy to fall into an 
unsheltered situation and very hard to get back out of it.”

$9.6 million raised for United Way to help 
communities thrive

TI’s annual United Way campaign raised $9.6 million in 2022 from 
employees and retirees, company sponsorships and TI Foundation 
grants and matching gifts. We support advanced programs in three 
areas that make up the building blocks of opportunity:

•  Education, which opens doors, broadens horizons and sets kids up 

for success.

•  Income, which brings financial stability – a key ingredient of a 

steady, successful life.

•  Health, which affects everything from how well a child can learn to 

how much an adult can earn.

Volunteer participation during the campaign was high, with 1,700 
hours spent supporting more than 50 activities across our U.S. sites 
to support United Way partner agencies.

“The generosity of TIers and their giving and volunteering spirit 
never ceases to amaze me,” said Andy Smith, director of giving and 
volunteering for TI and executive director of the TI Foundation. “Our 
company’s United Way campaign proved that when we live and give 
united to build stronger communities, we can advance the common 
good and create lasting change for every person.”

TI's history with United Way of Metropolitan Dallas dates to the early 
1960s, when TI co-founder J. Erik Jonsson helped oversee the efforts 
of the American Red Cross and the Community Chest in Dallas 
to create what was then called the United Fund. Since then, our 
company, the TI Foundation and our employees have worked closely 
with United Way to build stronger communities.

TI’s unit production increased 25% from 2018 to 2022. These totals are market-based GHG emissions.
5 TI is focused on the total reductions of scope 1 and scope 2 GHGs and our disclosure of the baseline reflects that approach. TI’s 2015 GHG emissions baseline was adjusted in the 2021 Corporate 
Citizenship Report to reflect structural changes to our operations, including the divestiture of a wafer fabrication plant in Scotland and the acquisition of a 300-mm wafer fabrication plant in Utah. 
The 2015 baseline has been adjusted from 2,471,357 to 2,832,709 MTCO2e in line with the guidance provided by the WBCSD/WRI’s The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard.
6 TI has not included fluorinated heat transfer fluids (FHTF) in previous Corporate Citizenship Reports due to the varying calculation methodologies and guidance. Under current World Semiconductor 
Council (WSC) reporting guidance, the association that tracks semiconductor emissions, there is no requirement to track and report FHTF. Recently introduced U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) rules for disclosure to the EPA included FHTF and we comply with this requirement. Recently, the WSC has aligned on all regions will moving to 2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) guidance, which includes FHTF. TI is considering the timing of a transition to the 2019 IPCC guidance and will include FHTF emissions upon adoption.
7 ERM Certification and Verification Services (CVS) provided limited assurance verification of TI's GHG emissions for 2022.

TI’s unit production increased 25% from 2018 to 2022.
13 To calculate water use, we compile municipal billing data and our production metrics. We also measure effluent rates and volumes and analyze industrial wastewater and stormwater samples 
using standard U.S. Environmental Protection Agency methodologies.
14 In 2018, totals included an estimated rainwater collection of 35 million gallons.

15 There is a small amount of water storage (relative to overall usage) in facilities systems, but the year-over-year change is insignificant.
16 This does not include once-through cooling water, which is pumped from on-site wells at our Freising, Germany, site and used only for heat rejection. This water returns to the original aquifer.
17 TI does not monitor total dissolved solids continuously at all sites.
18 TI calculates consumption as water withdrawn minus water discharged.

Organizational details

Our company name is Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN), and our headquarters are located at 12500 TI Blvd., Dallas, TX 75243. See the global map on the TI at a Glance section of our website for 
other countries of operation.

Entities included in the organization’s 
sustainability reporting

TI has two reportable segments: analog and embedded processing. We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other (see SEC Form 10-K, Part I, Item 1, pages 2-4).

TI’s Corporate Citizenship Report covers environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics for all TI-owned entities and facilities included in financial statements.

Reporting period, frequency and contact point

TI has produced its Corporate Citizenship Report annually since 2006, with a reporting period that covers the previous calendar year (2022, unless otherwise stated). This period aligns with the company’s 
financial reporting period. TI published its 2022 report in June 2023. For questions about the information contained within this report, email citizenshipfeedback@list.ti.com.

Restatements of information

We include restatements of data and information in the footnotes of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report and Performance Data Appendix.

External assurance

TI performs extensive internal due diligence to ensure the accuracy of the information and data presented in this report. In 2023, ERM Certification and Verification Services conducted limited assurance of 
scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) data for 2022 (see the Assurance Statement). 

We currently do not seek independent assurance of any additional nonfinancial data; however, Ernst & Young audits the TI Foundation’s financial records annually.

Activities, value chain and other business 
relationships

For information about the markets TI serves, see SEC Form 10-K, Part I, pages 5-6.

We market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our website and broad sales and marketing team, and, to a lesser extent, through distributors. Over the past several years, we have been 
investing in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships. As a result, in 2022 about 70% of our revenue was direct, which includes TI.com, as customers valued the convenience of purchasing 
online. Closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel advantage and give us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to opportunities 
to sell more of our products into each design. Additionally, broader and deeper access gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs. 

Our investments in new and improved capabilities to directly support our customers include website and e-commerce enhancements as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services. Our 
TI.com e-commerce channel offers a localized online experience in many countries, with convenience features such as immediate availability, local currency, payment methods, invoicing and importer of record. 
Our new application programming interfaces (APIs) give customers the ability to directly access real-time inventory information about TI products from their own systems, enabling them to purchase available 
chips immediately to better support their supply needs, reducing cost and delays. For more information, see SEC Form 10-K, Part I, Item 1, pages 6-7.

In 2022, TI brought two new 300-mm factories online in Richardson, Texas, and Lehi, Utah. The company is building additional fabs in Sherman, Texas and Lehi, Utah, which will further expand TI’s production 
capacity.

We spend roughly 80% of procurement dollars with approximately 300 suppliers, of which about 180 are critical to supporting semiconductor manufacturing. We define “critical suppliers” as those essential to
the supply strategy of a category procurement team that could cause a major disruption in manufacturing or design output. When needed, we outsource the manufacturing of wafers or product assembly and
testing. For more information about our supply chain, see the Supply Chain Responsibility section in TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report.

Membership associations

TI belongs to many associations with which it works on various policy objectives. We are more active in some organizations than others and do not work on all association issues. We may not align on all 
positions. We also collaborate with other outside groups and coalitions, such as the Responsible Business Alliance and Semiconductor Industry Association, to advance policies that drive growth; promote 
competitiveness; and support our shareholders, customers, employees and the communities in which we operate.

2-29

Approach to stakeholder engagement

We engage with stakeholders who directly influence or are interested in our operations. TI’s stakeholders include employees, customers, shareholders, communities where we have operations, academia, public 
officials, trade associations, regulatory agencies, nongovernmental organizations, analysts, suppliers, contractors, TI retirees and potential employees.

We tailor our engagement strategies and communications to the unique interests of the people and organizations that directly influence or have an interest in our operations. On ESG matters, we routinely 
engage investors, customers, suppliers, policymakers and other stakeholders to discuss issues of mutual interest. Our senior leaders regularly share stakeholder feedback on ESG matters with the executive 
team and board of directors.

Process to determine material topics

TI solicits input from internal and external stakeholders throughout the year through regular engagement. We also examine third-party sustainability assessments and benchmark disclosure trends and best 
practices. We then compare these inputs to our company priorities to determine what topics and disclosures to include in our annual Corporate Citizenship Report.

The input collected in 2021 continues to inform our reporting topics, while incorporating feedback from various stakeholder engagements in 2022. These topics may include additional disclosures not related to 
material topics in some instances:

Direct economic value generated and distributed

Our 2022 Annual Report provides information about our financial performance. See the Giving and Volunteering section of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report and Performance Data Appendix for 
philanthropic contributions.

201-2

Financial implications and other risks and 
opportunities due to climate change

TI evaluates risks related to the changing environment, such as severe weather, water availability, flooding and other threats. Each site and region evaluates these broader environmental risks. We invest capital 
in engineering controls that reduce operational and environmental impacts. We base each manufacturing site’s financial value on product revenue generated and its assets.

Any potential revenue loss associated with an environmental or severe weather event generates a potential business interruption loss, which we can partially offset by insurance. TI’s Risk Management and 
Business Continuity office reports companywide risks, such as those associated with environmental change, to the chief financial officer.

201-3

Defined benefit plan obligations and other 
retirement plans

For all U.S. employees who choose to opt into and contribute to a 401(k), we match 100% of their contributions, up to 4% of annual eligible earnings. We match up to 2% percent for employees who continue to 
accrue a benefit in our pension plan. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.

TI has various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree healthcare benefit plans. Contributions to these plans meet or exceed all minimum funding requirements. For 
more information, see SEC Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8, Note 7, pages 43-48: Postretirement benefit plans.

We offer a global profit-sharing program that rewards all eligible TIers for contributing to our financial success. Some countries, such as France and Mexico, have statutory requirements for their local profit-
sharing programs, which we meet.

201-4

Financial assistance received from the 
government

TI receives tax-benefit incentives from federal, state and local governments worldwide. These incentives are commonly available to manufacturing companies with investments in equipment and facilities, 
employment, and R&D. See SEC Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8, Note 2, pages 33-34 and Note 4, pages 37-40 for additional details.

TI does not maintain a standard entry wage for every country. However, we verified that we are paying employees above the local minimum wage in every country in which we operate. We compensate each 
employee based on their experience, performance, roles and responsibilities, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other protected characteristics.

Proportion of senior management hired from the 
local community

TI recruits senior management across globe, and promotes a high percentage of leaders from within. We currently don’t have a tracking system to gather hiring data geographically in this way.

Management of material topics

See the Supply Chain Responsibility section of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report and TI’s Suppliers website to learn more about how TI manages its supply chain.

Governance
TI’s vice president of worldwide procurement and logistics, who reports directly to the chief financial officer, leads supply chain management. Together, they oversee supply chain policies, performance and risk 
management. TI’s director of supply chain responsibility oversees supplier social and environmental responsibility and manages supplier diversity.

Codes of conduct
TI suppliers must adhere to TI’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which uses the Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) code of conduct as its foundation and includes environmental standards specifically applicable 
to TI’s suppliers.

Management system
Our supply chain management system provides a framework to systematically manage procurement, inventory, manufacturing, quality and distribution processes. It also helps us comply with operational and 
regulatory standards, track costs and monitor risks. Our management system meets the certification requirements of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Quality Management System 9001, 
ISO/Technical Specification 16949 and International Automotive Task Force 16949. The ISO annually evaluates the system as part of its recertification process.

Engagement
When initiating relationships with suppliers, we educate them about our standards and expectations for safe, humane and ethical labor practices, as well as human trafficking, forced labor and workers’ rights. 
We routinely communicate these guidelines in meetings; on our supplier website; and in purchase orders, supplier contracts and other related documents. We also routinely collaborate with industry groups such 
as the RBA, the Semiconductor Industry Association, and Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International to discuss and create supply chain standards and share best management practices.

Training
We deliver online and in-person training on our Supplier Code of Conduct, standards and expectations. We also leverage RBA’s training programs to help suppliers understand the alliance’s code of conduct, labor 
risks, respecting workers’ rights, hiring migrant workers and more.

Responsible minerals
TI is an early member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative, created by RBA and Global E-Sustainability Initiative members, which works to advance effective policies that address conflict mineral concerns. TI 
works diligently with its supply chain, including subcontracted manufacturers, to identify and eliminate non-compliant sources of material.

Grievance mechanisms
TI has established grievance mechanisms to ensure that its buyers or procurement representatives meet with suppliers to address any questions or concerns. If suppliers (or employees or contractors of 
suppliers) prefer, they can contact our Ethics Office to ask questions or discuss issues anonymously. Our Supply Chain Management team can also assist with identifying and addressing issues inconsistent 
with our ethics and values.

Our Supplier Code of Conduct requires our suppliers to establish and maintain programs that ensure the confidentiality, anonymity and protection of supplier and employee whistleblowers unless prohibited by 
law. Suppliers must have a communication process for their personnel to raise concerns without fear of retaliation.

Resources 
TI allocates extensive financial, human, training, information and engagement resources to help suppliers understand its policies and expectations, roles and responsibilities, performance and ethics 
expectations, and environmental, safety and health (ESH) and labor protections.

Management of material ESH topics

Note: The following applies to TI’s overall environmental, safety and health (ESH) management, which includes energy, emissions, materials and water.

Governance
See Board Oversight of ESG Matters.

Management system
Our ESH management system facilitates the planning, execution, evaluation and management oversight of activities and strategies. It meets certification requirements set by the International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) 14001 (environmental management system criteria) and ISO 45001 (occupational health and safety management system criteria). Our management system also contains programs, 
policies, controls, processes and measurement tools based on industry best practices and international standards. It helps us mitigate risks, improve our performance, fulfill compliance obligations and achieve 
our objectives.

Programs include extensive chemical and material screening, material sourcing, waste profiling, emissions management, and responsible recycling and disposal. We require 100% of our employees and 
supplemental contractors at all TI manufacturing and assembly/test sites to adhere to management system requirements. Other personnel not managed by TI are responsible for following their companies’ ESH 
management procedures and applicable regulatory requirements.

To ensure that our internal management system is effective, the Worldwide ESH Compliance Support team and independent third parties perform audits at each facility every three years; in interim years, the 
facilities perform self-assessments. They examine compliance with legal and TI standards and training effectiveness. Additionally, we:
• Survey employees and external stakeholders.
• Conduct legally required inspections and monitor incident rates.
• Benchmark against the RBA’s self-assessment disclosure and its code of conduct and against peers and members of the Semiconductor Industry Association.
• Have select sites third-party audited under the RBA’s Validated Audit Program.

Management of material ESH topics cont’d

We communicate gaps and best practices to other sites to avoid similar issues. Each manufacturing site also reports performance using a scorecard that measures energy use, water efficiency and landfill 
diversion. We share scorecards internally for transparency and best-practice awareness and as an accountability mechanism. We have not had to make significant adjustments to our corporate-level ESH 
management system because of audit findings.

Goals
TI implements programs to reduce energy intensity, material and water consumption, and GHG emissions. We track and report the effectiveness of these initiatives to senior leaders quarterly.

Policies
TI’s ESH policy is available in multiple languages: English, traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Malay, Spanish, German and Korean. TI’s Living our values – TI’s ambitions, values and code of 
conduct also includes sections on protecting human health and the environment.

Engagement
We evaluate a proposed project's potential positive and negative impacts on a community by conducting environmental impact assessments before site selection.

Grievance channels
We offer several channels through which internal and external stakeholders can submit ESH questions, concerns or grievances. All employees and supplemental contractors have “stop work” authority to remove 
themselves from work situations that they believe could cause injury, illness or environmental harm. They can also anonymously contact their supervisor, site ESH staff or the TI Ethics Office. Customers can 
contact ti.com/support or email all other ESH-related inquiries to citizenshipfeedback@list.ti.com.

Boundaries
Our organizational boundary includes TI manufacturing sites, larger non-manufacturing sites and support facilities subject to contracts considered embedded leases by TI for financial accounting purposes. 
Our operational boundary includes scope 1 and 2 emissions and water and wastewater from these sites and facilities, as applicable. More information on TI’s approach to GHG emissions reporting can be found 
in the TI GHG Emissions Inventory and Management Plan.

Resources
TI allocates extensive financial, human, training and communication resources to help TIers monitor and control potential ESH impacts, protect employee health and safety, understand specific ESH roles and 
responsibilities and drive improvements. We provide our ESH team with extensive training and tools to implement appropriate industry best practices and comply with regulatory requirements. To guide these 
efforts, we require employees and supplemental contractors at all manufacturing and assembly/test sites to adhere to our ESH Policy and Principles.

We calculate consumption data from water utility bills at sites that we financially control and that are larger than 50,000 square feet. Each year, we voluntarily report our water footprint to the CDP and in this 
report.

Water sources
Our water sources include surface water from local municipal supplies and groundwater. Our water footprint comprises three types of water:
•  Nonmanufacturing – used in restrooms, irrigation, drinking fountains and cafeterias.
•  Manufacturing – used to rinse wafers after chemical processing or for other fabrication processes.
•  Manufacturing support – used in exhaust abatement and cooling systems.

Interactions with water as a shared resource

See the Water section of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report and TI’s 2023 CDP Water Security response to learn more about how TI interacts with water and collaborates with stakeholders regarding this 
shared resource.

There are no water impacts directly attributable to discharges and runoff at any TI site. We sustain this by maintaining compliance with discharge limits in our permits, following TI standards, and ensuring that 
sites follow good housekeeping practices while actively collaborating to continuously improve and minimize exposure to water pathways. 

All of TI’s main manufacturing and assembly/test facilities set annual water conservation goals based on projects they identified as part of the company’s ongoing energy and water reduction strategy. Sites 
develop and complete water conservation projects based on various factors, including process system reliability, economic feasibility and sustainability targets. Public policy and water stress also factor into 
these decisions, influencing the availability and cost of water, which drive water reduction and reclaim efforts to ensure system reliability and business continuity.

Direct (scope 1) GHG emissions

See the Performance Data Appendix for scope 1 data. The gases included in our data calculations include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs), PFCs, 
sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). 

We calculate scope 1 GHG emissions using relevant guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the EPA’s Mandatory Reporting Rule and published emission factors. Our 
methodology includes accepted quantification methods, emission factors and global warming potential. For more information, see TI’s 2023 CDP Climate Change response.

305-2

Energy indirect (scope 2) GHG emissions

See the Performance Data Appendix for scope 2 market- and location-based data and our response to indicator 305-1. The gases included in our market- and location-based data calculations include CO2, CH4 
and N2O. In 2022, we made no significant emissions changes that triggered base-year emissions recalculations.

The EPA’s GHG Mandatory Monitoring and Reporting Requirements (MRR) Final Rule is our source of emissions factors and global warming potential rates. Scope 2 location-based electricity emission factors 
are from the U.S. EPA eGRID for U.S. sites and the International Energy Agency for all international sites. Scope 2 market-based factors are the Green E residual mix for U.S. locations and AIB Residual mix for 
our Freising, Germany location. All calculations for scope 2 emissions follow either U.S. EPA MMR or IPCC Tier 2 requirements. For more information, see TI’s 2023 CDP Climate Change response.

We aim to ensure that our recruiting efforts and workforce reflect the available talent pool. TI hired more than 10,200 employees (including exempt, non-exempt and interns) in 2022. Recruiting efforts and 
programs are unique by country and region, based on local needs. We recruit from the states and countries where we operate, particularly for entry-level and managerial positions, and then train employees for 
more advanced or senior roles. We use data analytics to track turnover by region to tailor programs for improvement.

In 2022, total turnover was 12.2%, up from 9.8% in 2021. As an indication of the longevity of our workforce, in 2022, 23% of our employees had worked at TI for more than 20 years.

Policies
TI is committed to giving employees a non-threatening work environment and does not tolerate any act or threat of violence or harassment. Our: 
•  Threat-Free Work Environment Policy describes our expectations. 
•  Supplier Code of Conduct requires that suppliers ensure that working conditions are safe. 
•  Supplier Environmental and Social Responsibility Policy outlines our expectations for health and safety. 
•  ESH Handbook for Suppliers summarizes TI’s standards, policies, guidelines and general practices.

403-1

Occupational health and safety management 
system

TI’s health and safety management system is voluntarily third-party certified to ISO 45001:2018. This management system:
•  Comprises interrelated and interacting elements used to establish our ESH policy and principles and objectives. 
•  Drives a reduction of occupational injuries and diseases and promotes and protects the physical and mental health of employees, contractors, customers and visitors. 
•  Records performance data; identifies trends, weaknesses and hazards; and remedies flaws. 
•  Ensures the quality of and facilitates workers’ access to safety and occupational health services. 

403-2

Hazard identification, risk assessment, and 
incident investigation

We require 100% of our employees and supplemental contractors at all manufacturing and assembly/test sites to adhere to the management system requirements. Other personnel not managed by TI are 
responsible for following their companies’ ESH management procedures and applicable regulatory requirements.

All TI sites are covered by occupational safety and health standards that help identify, evaluate and control potential workplace hazards. TI provides resources, training, one-on-one engagement and other tools 
to promote mental well-being and improve or maintain physical health. In accordance with internal standards, all workers are responsible for and receive periodic training and communications on how to report 
unsafe conditions and injuries by calling internally managed emergency response centers. They also receive training on their responsibility to suspend any operation or deactivate any equipment in the event of 
imminent risk to life, health or the environment.

Assessments 
Through routine programs, facility self-assessments and audits, work area sampling and health and safety surveys, we assess potential safety and health risks by: 
• Identifying, assessing and documenting potential workplace hazards and risks using qualitative and quantitative methods, and implementing appropriate controls to mitigate risks and ensure a safe workplace. 
• Using the results of these assessments to identify annual goals to drive risk reduction projects in accordance with ISO 45001:2018 continually.
• Performing a thorough investigation after all incidents and near misses to analyze the root cause and take corrective and preventive actions. 
• Communicating lessons learned and corrective action plans to other sites and groups to avoid similar issues. 
• Documenting all incidents for review by a central recordkeeping review panel, which ensures the quality and accuracy of each injury investigation and its associated documentation. 
• Conducting internal and external audits to verify the quality and effectiveness of our processes. TI’s needs and regulatory requirements determine competency requirements specific to job functions.

Occupational health services

See the Safety and Health section of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report to learn more about occupational health services. TI ensures the quality of occupational health services through:
•  Onsite clinics staffed by medical practitioners who hold recognized qualifications.
•  TI's worldwide medical director , who reviews a statement of work for medical providers and conducts on-site reviews as needed.
•  Medical surveillance oversight and tracking for occupational health examinations. 

In addition, all TI sites: 
•  Use an industrial hygiene program to identify, evaluate and control potential workplace hazards. 
•  Collect employee health data to design custom health-improvement programs, depending on TIers’ unique needs. 
•  Manage all personal health-related information as confidential according to all legal requirements and our confidentiality classification expectations.

403-4

Worker participation, consultation, and 
communication on occupational health and 
safety

TI sites have health and safety committees comprising ESH staff, site managers and employees who typically meet monthly to discuss site-specific needs. We consult with employees and supplemental 
contractors on various management system programs, training courses, and hazard and risk assessments to encourage their feedback on closing gaps, improving performance and proactively managing risks.
For employees not actively engaged in safety meeting discussions, a representative, such as a manufacturing superintendent, will attend and provide a conduit for information sharing.

403-5

Worker training on occupational health and 
safety

To reinforce TI’s commitment to its employees’ safety, we: 
• Train employees to prioritize safety and speak up about any potential hazards, how to correct or report unsafe behaviors and conditions, follow procedures and policies and use personal protective equipment. 
• Deliver occupational health and safety training to 100% of our employees and supplemental contractors. 
• Tailor training to each role to reinforce our commitment to compliance, resilient ESH standards and customers’ performance expectations. 
• Reinforce expectations regularly through safety campaigns, articles, meetings, posters and reminder emails.

403-6

Promotion of worker health

Our ESH leadership team reviews key outcomes and determines focus areas and opportunities for improvement every year. We expect our employees to share lessons learned and best practices to prevent 
future incidents and recognize and reinforce safe behavior.

TI has implemented many programs aimed at improving employees’ health. See the Safety and Health section of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report to learn more about occupational health services. For 
ergonomics risk, we:
•  Implement high- and medium-risk-reduction projects that help sites identify and reduce musculoskeletal disorder risks. 
•  Engage workers to assess safety and ergonomics risks and reinforce solutions. 
•  Offer a health care plan that includes a preventive health care provider who works with musculoskeletal discomfort. 
•  Implement a hearing conservation program and controls, which we continuously monitor according to our medical surveillance program. 
•  Created a website to help at-home employees conduct ergonomic assessments. 

At our manufacturing sites, we provide training on proper stretching to prepare the body for work and reduce fatigue, which is led by contracted health and fitness professionals and reinforced through a training 
manual and posters. 

U.S. employees also have access to on-demand stretching breaks and fitness classes. In the U.S., our Well-Being Steering committee increases awareness of TI’s wellness benefits and programs.
TI’s Safety Panel reviews all reported injury/illness cases. We share lessons learned with employees to increase risk awareness and deliver monthly safety topics to reinforce safe practices.

Our ambition to be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and want as our neighbor guides our work to build stronger communities.

TI’s goals and commitments can be found in the company’s annual Corporate Citizenship Report.

TI takes great pride in being a good corporate citizen and has a long standing commitment to responsible, sustainable manufacturing.

We produced our first Corporate Citizenship Report in 2006, and we remain committed to our long term environmental sustainability programs of conserving natural resources, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigating climate change.

As a semiconductor company that manufactures billions of chips per year, we believe that it is important to drive efficiencies in our fabrication process.

Multi year sustainability goals guide our work (see the next page), and we strive to efficiently manufacture chips to reduce energy use, GHG emissions, water use and the generation of landfill waste.

TI semiconductor products are and will increasingly play a critical role in helping reduce the impact on the environment.

Our semiconductors are helping customers to develop smaller, more efficient and affordable technology that makes electrification, renewable energy and energy storage solutions possible.

For more than a decade, TI has driven efficiencies in its fabrication processes and equipment to reduce environmental impacts.

We measure and track normalized, or per chip data, for GHG emissions, energy, water and material consumption as a way of assessing the overall resource efficiency of our manufacturing process.

By comparing normalized data, we can account for the resources and emissions associated with the production of a single chip and see how that has improved over time.

When comparing our per chip data from 2010 to 2022, we have significantly reduced manufacturing related impacts and resource consumption.

Over the past several years, TI has made progress in conserving energy and water, reducing energy consumption per chip, diverting landfill waste and working toward our long term goal of reducing scope 1 and scope 2 absolute GHG emissions by 25% from a 2015 base year by 2025.

In 2022, we experienced slight year over year increases in consumption and emissions as TI’s production increased.

This was because of continued customer demand throughout the year, and ramping two new 300 millimeter factories in Richardson, Texas, and Lehi, Utah.

Despite our operational growth, we remain committed to reducing our environmental impact.

We invest in hundreds of projects every year aimed at reducing that impact, such as using advanced manufacturing tools and technologies signing multiyear solar and wind power contracts to deliver renewable electricity in Texas and installing a solar roof at our site in Bangalore, India.

TI implements programs to reduce energy, material and water consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs).

The following table summarizes the progress we are making toward our reduction goals.

Use alternative gases and chemicals with lower global warming potential.

Purchase electricity from renewable energy sources.

The 2015 baseline has been adjusted from 2,471,357 to 2,832,709 MTCO2e in line with the guidance provided by the WBCSD WRI’s The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.

Under current World Semiconductor Council (WSC) reporting guidance, the association that tracks semiconductor emissions, there is no requirement to track and report FHTF.

Recently introduced U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules for disclosure to the EPA included FHTF and we comply with this requirement.

Recently, the WSC has aligned on all regions will moving to 2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidance, which includes FHTF.

TI is considering the timing of a transition to the 2019 IPCC guidance and will include FHTF emissions upon adoption.

TI faces potential risks and opportunities associated with climate change, which are described in detail in its TI's 2023 CDP Climate Change response.

Our CDP response, the Emissions section of the GRI Index and our TCFD Index also contain information about our climate change related governance and management strategies.

As of year end 2022, TI’s scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions were down 23% since 2015.

For additional GHG data, see our Performance Data Appendix.

TI's global operations, and design, manufacturing, assembly and test sites focus on lowering energy consumption and associated GHG emissions by setting annual reduction goals and implementing efficiency projects.

TI has a goal to reduce energy use per chip11 by 50% at worldwide manufacturing sites by year end 2025 from a 2015 base year.

We have progressed 28% toward this goal at the end of 202212.

Because of increased production, TI consumed 3.75 TWh of energy in 2022, up from 3.19 TWh in 2021.

For additional energy data, see our Performance Data Appendix.

For more information about how TI manages energy use, see the Energy section of the GRI Index.

TI is committed to increasing renewable energy use in the coming years as part of its GHG emissions reduction goal.

TI secures reliable energy supplies, including renewable resources where available, that are cost effective and align with business needs and objectives.

TI implements more than 200 projects each year to reduce energy throughout its operations.

These have helped us conserve 320 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy over the last five years, even as our production increased by 25% during the same period.

We focus most of our efforts on our manufacturing operations because they account for over 90% of our total energy use.

We offer competitive compensation and benefits designed to ensure that our talented employees, who will drive future growth, remain at TI.

Our compensation philosophy is based on pay for performance.

Both the employee’s contribution to TI’s success and company performance determine an individual’s compensation.

One of the unique aspects of TI’s compensation strategy is a global profit sharing program that rewards TIers for contributions to the company’s financial success.

TI makes payouts as a percentage of eligible earnings based on profitability each year.

Our profit sharing formula is based on profit from operations (PFO) and begins when TI reaches 10% PFO.

All TIers receive a payout based on the same percentage of eligible earnings.

Our profit sharing plan has paid out at the maximum level possible for the last seven years, equating to a 20% bonus for all eligible employees.

We have a long standing practice to pay our employees fairly and equitably.

TI maintains competitive and equitable compensation policies.

We designed checks and balances into our compensation system, including conducting regular in depth analyses, to ensure we achieve them.

In 2022, TI retained a third party to conduct a separate compensation analysis examining gender and race pay parity (including base, and bonus pay and equity) that considered job type, job level and country.

Our analysis confirmed that within the U.S. and worldwide, TI pays women as much as men.

In the U.S., TI pays minorities as much as non minorities.

Globally, women make 1.015 for every 1.000 men earn.

In the U.S., women make 1.002 for every 1.000 men earn, and minorities make 1.002 for every 1.000 non minorities earn.

TI’s benefits programs vary by country according to local market practice.

These programs can include medical, dental and vision plans short and long term disability plans and paid time off and retirement plans designed to adhere to local laws and regulations.

Additionally, our expanded benefits support workplace inclusion and equality, and we are committed to creating an environment of respect by providing inclusive benefits that support the unique needs of TIers and their families.

Resources and referrals for childcare and elder care.

Confidential counseling sessions and tools to support well being.

Concierge services for vacation planning, making reservations or other personal transactions.

To refine work life program offerings, we engage employees and audit our programs annually to remain competitive and improve services.

At TI, we believe in supporting our employees in all aspects of their lives, including the transition to parenthood.

We offer parental leave benefits to all new parents, enabling them to take time off to bond with their new child and adjust to new demands in their lives.

We are proud to be a family friendly workplace and remain committed to supporting our employees throughout their parenthood journeys.

Our U.S. parental leave benefits allow employees to take paid time away from work without worrying about financial or job security.

This benefit extends to all employees, regardless of gender, sexual orientation or family structure.

Tailored career development plans, mentoring programs and executive interaction to develop and encourage professional growth.

In 2022, Glassdoor recognized TI in its annual Best Places to Work ranking for the company’s culture, atmosphere and great employees.

TI invests in and incorporates safe and healthy practices and controls into its employees’ daily routines to help prevent workplace injuries and illnesses.

TI’s safety goals include a days away, restricted or job transfer (DART) case rate of 0.08 or less and a recordable case rate of 0.20 or less.

Our safety oriented culture includes implementing safety requirements and best practices globally to provide employees with a safe and healthy work environment.

Maintain proper safety and ergonomic protocols and controls.

Develop and maintain internal standards, which often exceed regulatory requirements.

Design and build inherently safe buildings and engineer out equipment risks.

Continuously audit our processes to assess compliance and performance.

To reduce exposure to health risks, TI applies rigorous industrial hygiene standards that establish the minimum requirements necessary for the safe use and proper storage of hazardous chemicals and other materials.

These standards include hazard communication and training, chemical labeling, and hazardous waste management.

Additionally, we eliminate or limit the use of potentially harmful materials, install ventilation and isolation controls, and conduct general hygiene and individual assessments.

The resources that we offer to TIers to take control of their health vary by country, depending on the extent of government health benefits available.

In the U.S., we provide free on site flu vaccines and preventive screening programs, fitness and nutrition programs, employee assistance programs, and counseling and education services.

Our health management service provides coaching and oversight to improve the well being of TIers who have experienced a significant medical event have extended work absences or are dealing with multiple diagnoses, treatments and providers.

Our benefit advocacy service helps estimate the costs of medical procedures and assists with locating affordable and quality health providers.

Our DART and recordable rates continue to be among the lowest in the U.S. semiconductor industry, according to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In 2022, TI’s DART rate was 0.18 while the 2021 industry average was 0.7 (2022 industry data is not yet available).

For more health and safety data, see the Performance Data Appendix.

See the Occupational Health and Safety section in the GRI Index for more information.

One of our three ambitions is to be a company that we’re personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor.

For decades, TI has worked to build stronger communities where the company operates.

We seek to improve the quality of life and strengthen our site communities across the globe.

TI and the TI Foundation19 make well considered and well measured investments in several areas.

TI targets its largest area of philanthropic giving at improving education.

Since 2010, the TI Foundation has invested more than 73 million in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education to improve math and science learning outcomes and opportunities for Black, Latino and female students who historically face economic and educational barriers.

Globally, we aim to improve access to educational resources in TI’s international site communities.

We help sustain the arts that make Dallas culturally inclusive and vibrant through multi year TI Foundation grants to premier organizations that emphasize the diversity of their outreach efforts and programming and through transformative grants to diverse groups that can become larger in scale and impact.

We support programs that dismantle barriers to racial equity, emphasizing police training and practices that reinforce accountability so that all people are policed equitably and our communities are safer places to live and work.

We aim to strengthen programs and services for critical needs among racially and economically marginalized populations.

We also preserve emergency funds for site communities and employees devastated by natural or human caused disasters.

To double the impact of U.S. employee giving, the TI Foundation matches active and retired employee donations of up to 30,000 per year to eligible nonprofit organizations.

In 2022, the TI Foundation provided more than 11 million in matching gifts.

TIers across the globe embody the philanthropic spirit our company founders set for TI. Their generosity especially during a time when so many are in great need is humbling, inspiring and gives us one more reason to be proud employees of Texas Instruments.

It makes grants primarily in North Texas and the U.S.

Our company’s North Texas headquarters is located in one of the most prosperous regions in the U.S., but hunger is a problem for one in eight residents, driven by inflation.

In response, the TI Foundation made a 300,000 grant to the North Texas Food Bank, helping provide approximately 1 million meals.

The grant supported the food bank’s mission to nourish North Texas, including in Dallas, Collin and Grayson counties, where our company has large operations.

Other notable support included more than 230,000 given by our employees and the TI Foundation including matching gifts to help the American Red Cross and its international affiliates provide humanitarian relief in Ukraine.

TI also donated 150,000 to the China Youth Development Foundation in response to a 6.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan.

The TI Foundation made a two year, 250,000 grant to Project Unity for programs that aim to remove racial divides in North Texas.

Programs focus on dialogue and trust building between area law enforcement, youth and communities.

The grant to Project Unity is the third investment by the TI Foundation as part of its commitment to support programs that dismantle barriers to racial equity.

The TI Foundation awarded 1.3 million in grants to Dallas arts organizations to support their objective of sustaining the arts that make Dallas culturally inclusive.

Recipients ranged from a new, experimental arts organization to long standing partners that present a variety of cultural experiences that reflect the diversity in audiences and programming.

TI and the TI Foundation made 14 million in education grants, which included matching employee and retiree donations.

With the evolving learning landscape and widening disparities in mind, the TI Foundation continued its 10 years of supporting public school districts in southern Dallas County through 4.7 million in funding.

We also furthered our two decades of support for the National Math and Science Initiative’s College Readiness Program, which serves four historically low income public school districts in southern Dallas County and one in Utah that primarily serves Navajo tribal nation students.

A new 1 million grant built on the work that TI began in 2021 with United Way of Metropolitan Dallas and Educate Texas on a Heal, Play, Learn program that addresses social and emotional wellness physical activity and arts engagement for students, teachers and families in southern Dallas County’s Cedar Hill and DeSoto public school districts.

The 2022 grant allowed those two districts to continue programming from 2021, during which 2,500 students, teachers and family members participated.

Funding also enabled the program to expand into the Lancaster Independent School District, also in southern Dallas County.

While not specifically a STEM investment, the active learning components of Heal, Play, Learn align with Texas grade level math and science requirements.

They are also heavily focused on soft skill STEM concepts, such as critical thinking, problem solving, creativity and collaboration.

Districts reported improved teacher and student morale and higher enrollment by 5% for students who were part of the program vs. those who were not.

Our employees are passionate about giving back and improving the quality of life in their communities.

TI has more than 20 global community involvement teams and other civic minded employees who work hard to solve local needs.

Together, they mentor students, coach robotics competitions, volunteer at food banks and homeless shelters, clean up neighborhoods, plant trees and give valuable time to serve their communities in other ways.

Volunteering programs brought TIers back together after the COVID 19 pandemic.

At nearly 257,000 hours of employee and retiree time donated, the number of hours spent volunteering doubled from 2021 at a value20 of 7.7 million.

In the U.S., the TI Foundation matches the value of employees’ volunteer hours up to 1,000 per year, which added almost 400,000 of additional support for their favorite causes.

Food bank donations and other activities by TIers in Dallas, Taiwan, Japan and Maine addressed hunger.

Employee networks in Santa Clara and Dallas helped build bikes for impoverished children.

TIers at our manufacturing site in Lehi, Utah, distributed refurbished computers to area students through an e waste recycling program.

Our community involvement teams in China, Malaysia and the Philippines focused their time on volunteering with children and at schools, painted murals, donated groceries to low income families, and shared the joy of learning math and science.

For more information about how we manage community citizenship, see Local Communities in the GRI Index and Education Engagement.

Nathan a wet process owner at TI’s Lehi, Utah, manufacturing site was recognized with a 2022 TI Founders Community Impact Award, which the company bestows on TIers who have made outstanding contributions to the communities where they live and work.

The biennial award honors our company’s founders and their long history of philanthropy and volunteerism.

Nathan demonstrates a remarkable commitment to working with the unsheltered and hungry in the Salt Lake City area, which like many large U.S. cities is experiencing a rise in homeless populations.

He received a 10,000 grant from TI to direct to a nonprofit organization of his choice.

Five other finalists each received 2,500 in grants to direct to selected nonprofits.

I serve this specific community because I was very close to losing my home and have been on food stamps before, Nathan said.

I know how a safe home and knowing where your next meal will come from has a tremendous effect on the rest of your life.

I believe every human has inherent value, and it is easy to fall into an unsheltered situation and very hard to get back out of it.

TI’s annual United Way campaign raised 9.6 million in 2022 from employees and retirees, company sponsorships and TI Foundation grants and matching gifts.

Education, which opens doors, broadens horizons and sets kids up for success.

Income, which brings financial stability a key ingredient of a steady, successful life.

Health, which affects everything from how well a child can learn to how much an adult can earn.

Volunteer participation during the campaign was high, with 1,700 hours spent supporting more than 50 activities across our U.S. sites to support United Way partner agencies.

The generosity of TIers and their giving and volunteering spirit never ceases to amaze me, said Andy Smith, director of giving and volunteering for TI and executive director of the TI Foundation.

Our company’s United Way campaign proved that when we live and give united to build stronger communities, we can advance the common good and create lasting change for every person.

TI's history with United Way of Metropolitan Dallas dates to the early 1960s, when TI co founder J. Erik Jonsson helped oversee the efforts of the American Red Cross and the Community Chest in Dallas to create what was then called the United Fund.

Since then, our company, the TI Foundation and our employees have worked closely with United Way to build stronger communities.

TI’s unit production increased 25% from 2018 to 2022.

TI’s 2015 GHG emissions baseline was adjusted in the 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report to reflect structural changes to our operations, including the divestiture of a wafer fabrication plant in Scotland and the acquisition of a 300 mm wafer fabrication plant in Utah.

The 2015 baseline has been adjusted from 2,471,357 to 2,832,709 MTCO2e in line with the guidance provided by the WBCSD WRI’s The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.

Our Supply Chain Management team can also assist with identifying and addressing issues inconsistent with our ethics and values.

Our Supplier Code of Conduct requires our suppliers to establish and maintain programs that ensure the confidentiality, anonymity and protection of supplier and employee whistleblowers unless prohibited by law.

Suppliers must have a communication process for their personnel to raise concerns without fear of retaliation.

Resources TI allocates extensive financial, human, training, information and engagement resources to help suppliers understand its policies and expectations, roles and responsibilities, performance and ethics expectations, and environmental, safety and health (ESH) and labor protections.

TI does not currently report supplier spending by individual markets.

See the Ethics and Compliance section of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report and Living our values TI’s ambitions, values and code of conduct to learn more about our management approach to anti corruption.

We assess all manufacturing sites for corruption and ethics risks annually using the RBA’s self assessment tools.

Additionally, we leverage an industry leading anti corruption and third party management system to assess our external engagements.

TI’s anti corruption compliance program assesses its worldwide operations and suppliers for risks related to corruption.

TI does operate in countries that are considered at higher risk for corruption.

However, the semiconductor industry is relatively low risk compared to construction, extractive or other industries where conducting business requires considerable interaction with government officials.

We have policies in place and conduct focused training for certain high risk countries and functions to address and mitigate these risks.

TI provides ethics and compliance awareness training that includes anti corruption topics to all employees, select suppliers and third parties.

Additionally, we make our anti corruption policy and code of conduct available to all employees and translate them into multiple languages.

We periodically assess and revise training programs and related efforts to reflect legal changes and support continuous compliance improvement.

TI investigates all reports for review and action.

If any confirmed incidents occur, we will take appropriate remedial actions.

For confidentiality reasons, we do not publicly report the number or nature of such incidents.

See the Ethics and Compliance section of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report and Living our values TI’s ambitions, values and code of conduct to learn more about the company’s management approach to anti competitive behavior.

We follow the laws, rules, and regulations where we operate and require our suppliers to do the same.

Note: The following applies to TI’s overall environmental, safety and health (ESH) management, which includes energy, emissions, materials and water.

Management system Our ESH management system facilitates the planning, execution, evaluation and management oversight of activities and strategies.

It meets certification requirements set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 (environmental management system criteria) and ISO 45001 (occupational health and safety management system criteria).

Our management system also contains programs, policies, controls, processes and measurement tools based on industry best practices and international standards.

It helps us mitigate risks, improve our performance, fulfill compliance obligations and achieve our objectives.

Programs include extensive chemical and material screening, material sourcing, waste profiling, emissions management, and responsible recycling and disposal.

We require 100% of our employees and supplemental contractors at all TI manufacturing and assembly test sites to adhere to management system requirements.

Other personnel not managed by TI are responsible for following their companies’ ESH management procedures and applicable regulatory requirements.

To ensure that our internal management system is effective, the Worldwide ESH Compliance Support team and independent third parties perform audits at each facility every three years in interim years, the facilities perform self assessments.

They examine compliance with legal and TI standards and training effectiveness.

Additionally, we: Survey employees and external stakeholders.

Conduct legally required inspections and monitor incident rates.

Benchmark against the RBA’s self assessment disclosure and its code of conduct and against peers and members of the Semiconductor Industry Association.

Have select sites third party audited under the RBA’s Validated Audit Program.

We communicate gaps and best practices to other sites to avoid similar issues.

Each manufacturing site also reports performance using a scorecard that measures energy use, water efficiency and landfill diversion.

We share scorecards internally for transparency and best practice awareness and as an accountability mechanism.

We have not had to make significant adjustments to our corporate level ESH management system because of audit findings.

Goals TI implements programs to reduce energy intensity, material and water consumption, and GHG emissions.

We track and report the effectiveness of these initiatives to senior leaders quarterly.

Policies TI’s ESH policy is available in multiple languages: English, traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Malay, Spanish, German and Korean.

TI’s Living our values TI’s ambitions, values and code of conduct also includes sections on protecting human health and the environment.

Engagement We evaluate a proposed project's potential positive and negative impacts on a community by conducting environmental impact assessments before site selection.

Grievance channels We offer several channels through which internal and external stakeholders can submit ESH questions, concerns or grievances.

All employees and supplemental contractors have stop work authority to remove themselves from work situations that they believe could cause injury, illness or environmental harm.

They can also anonymously contact their supervisor, site ESH staff or the TI Ethics Office.

Customers can contact ti.com support or email all other ESH related inquiries to citizenshipfeedback list.ti.com.

Boundaries Our organizational boundary includes TI manufacturing sites, larger non manufacturing sites and support facilities subject to contracts considered embedded leases by TI for financial accounting purposes.

Our operational boundary includes scope 1 and 2 emissions and water and wastewater from these sites and facilities, as applicable.

More information on TI’s approach to GHG emissions reporting can be found in the TI GHG Emissions Inventory and Management Plan.

See the Energy section of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report and GRI: 302 ESH Disclosure of Management Approach in this index to learn more about how we manage energy consumption.

See the Energy section of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report and the Performance Data Appendix to learn more about the energy consumed from renewable and non renewable sources.

For details on energy consumed outside of TI, see our CDP Climate Change response.

When calculating energy intensity, we divide the total energy consumption by the number of wafer chips (not including external manufacturing) produced each year.

We then compare this to a 2015 base year to report a ratio based only on internal energy consumption.

The energy types included in the ratio are natural gas, gasoline, diesel, electricity, propane, fuel oil, liquid petroleum gas and district heating.

See the Performance Data Appendix of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report for energy reduction data.

TI does not have data collection processes to track, record and report this information exactly this way.

See the Water section of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report and TI’s 2023 CDP Water Security response to learn more about water management.

The TI ESH water management standard outlines requirements of wastewater programs, sewage treatment programs, stormwater pollution prevention and water reduction activities at each site.

Additionally, we: Visually inspect our onsite wastewater treatment plants regularly to ensure they operate properly and do not leak.

Periodically clean the plants and inspect the treatment basins for integrity.

We calculate consumption data from water utility bills at sites that we financially control and that are larger than 50,000 square feet.

Each year, we voluntarily report our water footprint to the CDP and in this report.

Water sources Our water sources include surface water from local municipal supplies and groundwater.

Our water footprint comprises three types of water: Nonmanufacturing used in restrooms, irrigation, drinking fountains and cafeterias.

Manufacturing used to rinse wafers after chemical processing or for other fabrication processes.

Manufacturing support used in exhaust abatement and cooling systems.

See the Water section of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report and TI’s 2023 CDP Water Security response to learn more about how TI interacts with water and collaborates with stakeholders regarding this shared resource.

There are no water impacts directly attributable to discharges and runoff at any TI site.

We sustain this by maintaining compliance with discharge limits in our permits, following TI standards, and ensuring that sites follow good housekeeping practices while actively collaborating to continuously improve and minimize exposure to water pathways.

All of TI’s main manufacturing and assembly test facilities set annual water conservation goals based on projects they identified as part of the company’s ongoing energy and water reduction strategy.

Sites develop and complete water conservation projects based on various factors, including process system reliability, economic feasibility and sustainability targets.

Public policy and water stress also factor into these decisions, influencing the availability and cost of water, which drive water reduction and reclaim efforts to ensure system reliability and business continuity.

Our internal water management standard includes guidelines that ensure compliance with wastewater, stormwater and sewage discharge permits, along with other requirements.

Sites monitor water quality and have procedures to manage spills or other abnormalities.

We report wastewater discharges and the portion of total water discharged through regulated wastewater treatment points to local, state, federal and international regulatory agencies.

See the Water section of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report and TI’s 2023 CDP Water Security response to learn more about wastewater management.

Local regulatory agencies set minimum quality standards for effluents, which all TI sites manage to permissible limits.

Some regulators incorporate sector specific standards to set their requirements.

See the Performance Data Appendix of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report for water withdrawal data.

Municipal sources and groundwater supply our water.

We calculate consumption from sites TI fully controls larger than 50,000 square feet.

Federal, state or local regulators create wastewater permits that define and determine priority substances that must meet discharge limits.

We comply with these limits by treating water in onsite treatment plants, separating concentrated metals and solvents from waste streams, and taking other actions.

See the Performance Data Appendix of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report for discharge data.

See the Water section of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report and Performance Data Appendix for consumption and storage data.

We calculate consumption data from total water usage and site specific factors, such as evaporation, irrigation and boiler or cooling tower use.

We verify this data by examining site water balances and discharge flow rates from our wastewater and sewage treatment systems.

TI reports water usage data to local, state, federal and international regulatory agencies.

See the Greenhouse Gas Emissions section of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report, GRI: 302 ESH Disclosure of Management Approach in this index and TI’s 2023 CDP Climate Change response to learn more about how we manage emissions.

We conduct routine monitoring and audits to comply with air quality and GHG emission regulations and reporting requirements that vary by country, state and municipality.

We must report U.S. GHG emissions to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to comply with its mandatory reporting requirements.

The EPA requires that the semiconductor industry (among other industries) measure and report annual fluorinated GHG emissions (such as sulfur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons PFCs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons), as well as GHG emissions from combustion sources.

We also voluntarily report our GHG emissions data to the World Semiconductor Council (as part of the U.S. industry report), the CDP and in our annual Corporate Citizenship Report.

TI reports U.S. air emissions data to federal and state regulators.

We also report chemical releases and pollution prevention activities to the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory.

Boundaries Our organizational boundary includes TI manufacturing sites, larger non manufacturing sites, and support facilities subject to contracts considered embedded leases by TI for financial accounting purposes.

Our operational boundary includes scope 1 and 2 emissions from these sites and facilities, as applicable.

See the Performance Data Appendix for scope 1 data.

The gases included in our data calculations include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs), PFCs, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).

We calculate scope 1 GHG emissions using relevant guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the EPA’s Mandatory Reporting Rule and published emission factors.

Our methodology includes accepted quantification methods, emission factors and global warming potential.

For more information, see TI’s 2023 CDP Climate Change response.

See the Performance Data Appendix for scope 2 market and location based data and our response to indicator 305 1.

The gases included in our market and location based data calculations include CO2, CH4 and N2O.

In 2022, we made no significant emissions changes that triggered base year emissions recalculations.

The EPA’s GHG Mandatory Monitoring and Reporting Requirements (MRR) Final Rule is our source of emissions factors and global warming potential rates.

Scope 2 location based electricity emission factors are from the U.S. EPA eGRID for U.S. sites and the International Energy Agency for all international sites.

Scope 2 market based factors are the Green E residual mix for U.S. locations and AIB Residual mix for our Freising, Germany location.

All calculations for scope 2 emissions follow either U.S. EPA MMR or IPCC Tier 2 requirements.

For more information, see TI’s 2023 CDP Climate Change response.

For details on scope 3 GHG emissions, see TI’s CDP Climate Change response.

TI’s normalized GHG market based emissions intensity ratio in 2022 was 0.27.

The ratio equals the emissions intensity in 2022 divided by the emissions intensity in 2005.

We calculate the intensity using both scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, with CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and NF3 as the numerator and the number of chips produced within TI as the denominator.

TI’s scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions were down 23% from 2015 to 2022.

See the Performance Data Appendix and TI’s 2023 CDP Climate Change response for more information about emission reductions.

TI does not allow the use of Class I and II ODSs, except in closed loop refrigeration systems if the refrigeration system equipment was purchased or acquired before the ODS refrigerant’s elimination date.

We do store some refrigerant gases for maintaining refrigeration systems for our chillers.

See the Performance Data Appendix of TI’s 2022 Corporate Citizenship Report for U.S. air emissions data.

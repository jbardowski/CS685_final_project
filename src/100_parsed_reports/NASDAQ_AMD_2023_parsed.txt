on AMD technology daily. Our high-performance 
processors are at the heart of devices and services 
across a broad set of customer markets, including 
data center, communications, healthcare, aerospace, 
automotive, PC, gaming and more.

In February 2022, AMD acquired XilinxTM to offer one of the 
strongest and most diversiﬁed portfolio of high-performance 
and adaptive computing solutions. We also expanded our data 
center solutions capabilities to further address the signiﬁcant 
demand for computing by acquiring Pensando SystemsTM in 
April 2022.

With more than 90 locations worldwide — including 
engineering facilities, sales and business service sites and 
corporate offices — we aspire to embed environmental 
sustainability across our business, promote safe and responsible 
workplaces in our global supply chain and advance stronger 
communities where we live and work.

Solving the World’s Most 
Important Challenges

AMD offers high-performance and adaptive computing 
solutions to power the workloads of the future, combining 
the best of architecture, packaging and process technology 
with software. We design and develop semiconductor 
technology in four primary product markets: 

     Accelerating Today’s Data

     Powering Incredible Gaming Experiences

Today’s data centers, supercomputers and cloud environments require vast 
amounts of computing performance to enable the digital experiences that 
enhance our daily lives. AMD offers a broad portfolio of solutions, including 
server central processing units (CPUs), data processing units (DPUs), graphics 
accelerators (GPUs), ﬁeld programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and adaptive 
system-on-chip (SoC) products.

In 2022, we released 4th Gen AMD EPYC™ CPUs, bringing leadership 
performance and energy efficiencyi to modern data centers and announced 
our next-generation AMD Instinct™ MI300 accelerators, designed for leadership 
high-performance computing (HPC) and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) performance.

     Enabling Intelligent Embedded Devices

AMD is the leader in adaptive and embedded computing, CPUs, FPGAs and 
adaptive SoCs for a variety of markets, including healthcare, automotive, 
industrial, storage and networking. Our products reach beyond our planet too: 
AMD expanded on its long history of powering space exploration in 2022, with 
the ﬁrst space-grade Versal™ adaptive SoCs that help enable on-board AI 
processing in space.    

High-performance AMD computing and graphics technologies – including 
discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services – work 
together with software to power immersive gaming experiences for personal 
computers (PCs), the latest game consoles and cloud gaming services. In 2022, 
we launched the Radeon™ RX 7900 Series graphics cards — the world’s ﬁrst 
gaming graphics cards to feature an advanced AMD chiplet design — to deliver 
extreme performance and energy efficiency. 

     Delivering Powerful and Efficient 
     Personal Computing

AMD continues to drive innovation in premium PCs with AMD Ryzen™ 
processors and AMD Radeon™ graphics. Our lineup of CPUs, accelerated 
processing units and chipsets for desktop and notebook PCs brings 
performance, efficiency and modern security features to gamers, creators, 
consumers and enterprises. In early 2023, we unveiled Ryzen™ AI, the ﬁrst

A Message from Dr. Lisa Su, AMD Chair
and Chief Executive Officer
At AMD, we push the limits of high-performance and adaptive computing to solve the world’s most 
important challenges. Our technology touches the lives of billions of people around the world, playing 
a vital role accelerating scientiﬁc research, exploring deep space, keeping drivers safe on the road and 
powering businesses. But it’s not enough to deliver next-generation experiences. At AMD, we are 
committed to doing so responsibly, with integrity and in a way that fundamentally aligns with our 
values and inclusive culture.   

Our 28th annual report is the ﬁrst since Xilinx and Pensando joined AMD to create a larger company 
with an expanded team and a broader set of products — all of which helped us grow annual revenue 
44 percent to a record US$23.6 billion in 2022. Thanks to our customers, partners, suppliers and 
employees, I am proud to say we also made signiﬁcant progress in 2022 on our focus areas, spanning 
digital impact, environmental sustainability, supply chain responsibility and diversity, belonging and 
inclusion.

Our digital impact initiatives, such as the AMD University program, cloud-based grants and on-site 
hardware donations, put AMD technology in the hands of those solving pressing challenges in healthcare, 
climate, education and beyond.

We introduced new products in support of our goal to deliver a 30x increase in energy efficiency by 2025 
for AI-training and high-performance computing applications. Our focus on energy–efficient computing 
is also gaining momentum, with seven of the world’s top 10 most energy efficient supercomputers 
powered by AMD ranked on the June 2023 Green500 list.

These achievements reﬂect our differentiated IP portfolio, strong collaboration across our value chain 
and expanded partnerships. As one of the world’s largest fabless semiconductor companies, we work 
with a carefully chosen network of suppliers to address collective needs throughout the value chain, 
from human rights risks to environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions and water usage. 
In 2022, we made progress toward our goals for supplier capacity-building and audits. And we again 
received the CDP Supplier Engagement Leadership recognition for addressing climate risks in the supply 
chain, which is reserved for the top 8% of reporting companies.

At AMD, our true strength lies in our people. I am excited to report that 92% of our employees say they are 
proud to work for AMD. We remain committed to pursuing diversity, belonging and inclusion in our workforce, 
given its tangible value to innovation and company performance; in 2022 we were recognized as a member 
of the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the fourth consecutive year. To amplify the good work of 
our employees around the world, in 2022 we also launched a year-round employee matching program, which 
contributed to the total US$11.6 million in cash and technology that AMD, AMD Foundation and our employees 
donated to nonproﬁt organizations, universities and research institutes. 

You can read more about our progress and priorities throughout this report. While we have accomplished 
so much in recent years, I am even more excited about what AMD, together with our partners, can accomplish 
moving forward.

About Our Reporting

A Message from Susan Moore, Corporate Vice President, 
Corporate Responsibility and International Government 
Affairs, AMD, and President, AMD Foundation 

Our approach to corporate responsibility has remained fundamentally 
consistent for almost three decades: we listen to our stakeholders and 
embrace the business value of corporate responsibility across our products, 
operations, supply chain and engagement. But what has changed over 
the past year is our extended reach  through programs, measured progress 
and disclosure following the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando. To inform 
our priorities, we updated our ESG materiality assessment and conducted 
a human rights saliency assessment.

A key aspect of the companies’ integration was incorporating them into 
our internal corporate responsibility (CR) governance – our Executive ESG 
Steering Committee, Executive Team and Board – helping fully embed CR 
across the broader company. We also increased our collaboration on related 
issues, with more employee brieﬁngs, customer dialogues and supplier 
engagements on climate, labor and human rights.

AMD shares many of the same challenges facing our industry, including the 
increasing urgency of the climate crisis. We are driving meaningful change 
with a science-based target for our operations and increased accountability: 
we have received external limited assurance on Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
(including historical Xilinx data for 2020 and 2021), Scope 3 business travel 
and ﬁve of our ESG goals.

We continue to deliver market-leading products to help our customers to 
advance their sustainability goals, too. As of mid-2023, we are on track toward 
achieving a 13.5x improvement in energy efficiency for AMD processors and 
accelerators powering servers for AI-training and high-performance computing, 
compared to the 2020 baseline. We were honored to receive a 2022 SEAL 
Sustainable Product Award for innovative and impactful products ‘purpose-
built’ for a sustainable future in data centers. 

In the larger ecosystem, we continue to work with customers, suppliers and 
peers to address the signiﬁcant sources of GHG emissions. This includes my 
service as vice chair of the Responsible Business Alliance Board of Directors, 
with its focus and programs to advance responsibility in supply chains 
worldwide.

AMD values our site communities worldwide, and in 2022 we saw a return 
to in-person volunteer engagement. In a remarkable effort to ﬁght hunger, 
during our annual day of community service, AMDers packed 350,000 meals 
for people globally facing food insecurity. We also continued to support local 
communities ﬁnancially, investing US$10 million through the CNote platform 
to increase economic mobility and ﬁnancial inclusion in underserved U.S. 
communities. 

I invite you to learn more about these and other initiatives in this report, 
which is aligned with the GRI Standards, SASB Standards and TCFD 
recommendations.

In closing, I thank my AMD colleagues for their drive to deliver exceptional 
semiconductor technologies while pursuing sustainable development for 
a better future in our world.

Our Approach to Corporate Responsibility

ESG Materiality Matrix

We look at CR through the lens of environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) issues, which enables us to focus our efforts, 
operationalize our goals into the business and make the most 
impact. It also helps us focus our reporting and transparency 
efforts on the issues that have the largest impact on our business 
and society.

We continuously monitor and address a broad range of topics. We also conduct 
periodic evaluations to better understand the overall landscape, set priorities 
and evolve our practices, policies and programs. In 2023, we engaged with 
BSR, a global sustainable business network and consultancy, to complete an 
impact-based ESG materiality assessmentii. This assessment took into account 
the evolution of our business (including our acquisitions in 2022), evolving 
investor and other stakeholder ESG information needs and the continuing 
evolution of reporting expectations informed by organizations such as the 
Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.  

The resulting ESG materiality matrix reﬂects our most material issues based 
on their potential impact on the business and the potential impact the 
business has on society and the environment. As a result, the assessment 
adopts a ‘double materiality’ approach. Although this assessment has resulted 
in some changes to the placement of topics within our matrix compared to 
previous assessments, the issues themselves remain fairly consistent. The 
main exception is the emergence of responsible AI and product use as a top-tier 
material issue based on the double materiality approach used for the purposes 
of this assessment.

The results of the materiality assessment reaffirm our company’s CR strategic 
focus areas (on page 8) while providing valuable insight into new facets that 
need to inform our business strategy and operations moving forward. We also 
consider several of the issues noted in the matrix as part of our foundational 
approach to conducting business responsibly. These issues include responsible 
sourcing, corporate governance, ethical conduct, product security, data privacy, 
business continuity planning and supply chain resilience.

About Our Reporting

How We Are Integrating Xilinx 
and Pensando, Recent Acquisitions,  
into Our CR Priorities and Programs 
In 2022, AMD closed two major acquisitions, Xilinx and 
Pensando Systems, advancing our company’s continued 
opportunities for technology and product leadership, 
market diversiﬁcation and expanded customer partnerships. 
We have been investing and working diligently since the 
close of the acquisitions to support effective integration 
for our shareholders, customers and employees, ensuring 
our view of AMD remains clear through the ESG lens. 
Examples include: 

     Digital Impact

To advance research in areas related to the world’s biggest challenges, 
AMD integrated the Xilinx Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute 
Clusters (HACC) with the AMD HPC Fund, providing researchers with 
access to AMD EPYC™ processors, AMD Instinct™ accelerators, Xilinx 
Alveo™ accelerators and Xilinx Versal™ ACAPs. Their efforts are 
addressing issues in climate change, healthcare, transportation and 
big data. In addition, we have consolidated our academic initiatives 
into the AMD University Program, including collaboration with 
universities and research organizations, research grants and hardware 
donations.

     Environmental Sustainability 

To reﬂect the current business, AMD reset the 2020 baseline for our 
2020-2030 operational GHG goal (Scope 1 and 2). AMD obtained third-
party, limited level assurance of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions of Xilinx 
operations for 2020 and 2021 (prior to the acquisition), and for the 
combined company in 2022. With regard to Scope 3 GHG emissions, 
Xilinx and Pensando did not have Scope 3 inventories (covering areas 
like the supply chain and product use) upon acquisition. Upstream GHG  

emissions related to the acquisitions, including supply chain, are included 
in our 2022 Scope 3 estimates. In the second half of 2023 we will continue 
our work to estimate related downstream GHG emissions, including 
product use.

     Diversity, Belonging and Inclusion 

Our Diversity, Belonging and Inclusion (DB&I) program and initiatives 
apply globally, and in 2022, we focused on integrating our new employees 
and expanding our DB&I efforts across our larger company. For example, 
employee resource group (ERG) leaders from AMD and Xilinx aligned 
on our DB&I philosophy and highlighted the integral role of ERGs in our 
company’s purpose and priorities. We also added two new ERGs – 
Incredible India and Multicultural – bringing the total to 13. By sharing 
ideas and best practices we ampliﬁed our collective efforts, helping build 
a stronger culture.

     Supply Chain Responsibility

AMD is committed to responsible business throughout our supply chain, 
which has grown with our acquisitions. In 2022, we shared the AMD Supply 
Chain Responsibility Guide with new direct manufacturing suppliers and 
began to monitor their conformance to the requirements set out in the 
AMD Code of Conduct and Supply Chain Responsibility Guide.  

     Community Involvement

We celebrated our ﬁrst AMD Day of Service as a combined company – 
an initiative for employees to join one another in volunteering to beneﬁt 
our communities while meeting one another in enjoyable, meaningful 
activities. In addition to a number of events held across our sites globally, 
AMD partnered with the nonproﬁt organization Rise Against Hunger to 
host meal packing events at 11 sites to empower and nourish communities 
and respond to severe emergencies and disasters.

Our approach to CR management and governance applies to all aspects of our business, 
spanning product design, supply chain, AMD operations and external engagement. 

Embedding CR across the business in this way requires commitment and accountability throughout AMD, 
from our leaders who set the strategy to those working hands-on to improve our performance. We pursue 
this through executive leadership and effective cross-functional team coordination. Along with actionable 
stakeholder engagement, this enables us to set clear objectives, track progress and promote accountability 
through transparent disclosure.

OVERSIGHT OF OUR APPROACH IS MULTI-FACETED:  

     The AMD Board of Directors
The highest level of ESG oversight (including risks 
and opportunities) at AMD resides with our Board. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee maintains formal oversight of the 
company’s focus on ESG. The Audit and Finance 
Committee oversees the company's voluntary and 
required ESG reporting and associated regulatory 
compliance. The Compensation and Leadership 
Resources Committee oversees our focus on 
diversity, belonging and inclusion. Each of these 
groups receives reports from and engages with 
management on ESG matters at least annually.

     The AMD ESG Executive
     Steering Committee
Our ESG Executive Steering Committee is responsible 
for overseeing progress on our CR priorities, goals 
and disclosures while communicating regularly with 
the AMD Executive Team (AET). It is comprised of 
cross-functional leaders (director level or higher) 
from Finance, Global Operations, Human Resources, 
Investor Relations, Information Technology, Legal, 
Public Affairs and other departments. In addition 
to ongoing collaborative initiatives, the Committee 
meets at least quarterly. 

     The AMD Executive Team
AET – including our Chief Executive Officer, executive 
vice presidents and certain senior vice presidents – 
helps set CR strategic priorities and goals for their 
departments, while providing company investments 
and resources to demonstrate progress. Relevant AET 
members receive regular updates, at least monthly, 
on ESG topics. Needs and proposals are discussed 
throughout the year when warranted. 

     The AMD Corporate
     Responsibility Team
The CR team works cross-departmentally to help 
operationalize the day-to-day management of many 
ESG-related policies, practices and infrastructure. The 
CR team also leads ESG reporting and communications. 
In its role, the CR team regularly engages with other 
AMD departments such as EHS, Engineering, Global 
Operations, Human Resources, Investor Relations, 
Legal and Quality to help us manage environmental 
and social issues effectively and efficiently. CR resides 
within Public Affairs and reports to our Senior Vice 
President of Legal, General Counsel and Corporate 
Secretary, who reports to our Chief Executive Officer.

About Our Reporting

     Risk Management

     Ethics and Compliance 

     Anti-corruption

AMD takes a multi-faceted approach to CR-related risk management. 
For example, a cross-functional team focused on product energy 
efficiency meets bi-monthly to discuss regulatory and standards 
developments that may pose short, medium or longer-term risks or 
opportunities. The team is led by our Corporate Vice President of 
International Government Affairs and Corporate Responsibility, with 
the participation of product engineers and business teams.

Business continuity planning is another area of risk management that 
brings together Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS), Finance, 
Human Resources, Global Operations, Information Technology and 
other teams to identify and plan for events that could disrupt AMD 
or supplier operations.

We also monitor risks in our value chain. While we cannot guarantee 
our suppliers compliance with our corporate responsibility priorities, we 
conduct facility-level due diligence of our direct manufacturing suppliers 
to help address risk factors related tohuman rights (e.g. forced labor), 
environmental factors (e.g. water risk) and ethics (e.g. corruption). For 
our non-manufacturing (indirect) suppliers, we annually conduct a risk 
assessment based on geography, sector and spend to identify the highest 
risk suppliers for additional due diligence steps such as self-assessment 
questionnaires and other direct engagements. We also contribute to 
industry efforts to advance sub-tier supplier mapping to identify and 
address risks further into the supply chain.

To manage EHS risk within our own operations, we apply our Global EHS 
Standards, which include periodic risk assessments of operational EHS 
risks at the site and corporate level. We complete these at least annually, 
but an assessment may also be triggered when there is a signiﬁcant 
change in operations. We evaluate risks to the EHS controls in place, and 
we use the results, as well as compliance audits and internal inspections, 
to identify focus areas and corrective actions and continually improve 
our programs.

AMD is committed to conducting our business in a fair, ethical and 
honest manner and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and 
regulations. Senior leadership, starting with our CEO, communicates 
to all employees the importance of acting in concert with our core values. 
Employees are assigned ethics and compliance training focused on 
anti-corruption, anti-harassment, import/export compliance, and the 
prevention of insider trading, conﬂicts of interest and antitrust, among 
other topics.

The AMD Board of Directors has governing authority with oversight 
responsibility of all business ethics issues. Our Corporate Compliance 
Committee is responsible for oversight of the AMD Worldwide Standards
of Business Conduct (WWSBC) and related policies and procedures 
(e.g. compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export control 
policies, privacy regulations and conﬂict of interest rules). The Corporate 
Compliance Committee provides quarterly activity reports of ethics and 
compliance cases to the Board and undertakes a program overview 
annually. Additionally, in 2022, a new Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) role 
and office were formed to manage and implement company-wide ethics 
and compliance programs and initiatives. A Compliance Team, reporting 
to the CCO, coordinates with various other business functions to drive 
compliance with the WWSBC and related policies and procedures.

All employees are required to complete the WWSBC training when hired 
and every three years thereafter. To further mitigate risks, we provide 
additional training for speciﬁc groups on relevant topics, including anti-
corruption, export compliance and contracting.

We maintain a process for reporting misconduct and encourage employees 
to raise concerns and ask questions. Employees and other stakeholders 
are informed of our non-retaliation policy. AMD Aware is a multilingual web 
portal and telephone service that accepts reports, including anonymous 
reports, about suspected illegal activity or violations of the WWSBC, as 
permitted by law. AMD Aware is available to all AMD employees and third 
parties worldwide 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Read more about business ethics and compliance  

In 2021, building on our existing anti-corruption guidelines in the WWSBC, 
we created a standalone global policy to help employees and key personnel 
address anti-corruption issues when conducting company business. The AMD 
Global Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy describes prohibitions and 
required processes related to speciﬁc areas of risk, such as gifts, meals and 
entertainment and our company’s policy prohibiting facilitation payments. 
The policy also describes the expansive deﬁnitions of government official 
and government entity, together with special considerations for transactions 
involving them. Additionally, it sets forth the company’s policy on engaging 
with third parties or intermediaries to work for the company.

Read our Global Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy

     Privacy

AMD has implemented systems, processes and procedures to protect 
the personal information of AMD employees, job applicants, temporary 
workers, contingent workers, contractors, users and business partners 
worldwide. AMD maintains a full suite of policies and processes that 
govern how we process personal information, comply with privacy laws 
and enter into privacy agreements, when applicable, with third parties 
and service providers.

The global Privacy Team, which reports to the Chief Compliance Officer, 
oversees and coordinates privacy-related activities across diverse 
business functions responsible for handling various aspects of privacy. 
The Privacy Team is supported by regional counsel in major regions like 
the European Union and Asia Paciﬁc on local privacy requirements. Our 
website Privacy Policy, directly linked from the footer of the AMD home 
page, provides details about privacy practices governing the personal 
data of users, customers and various third parties. Employees and other 
personnel have access to a detailed employee privacy notice posted on 
the AMD intranet about privacy practices governing employee personal 
data, and when applicable, they can access bilingual and local privacy 
notices.

About Our Reporting

     Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is a top priority for AMD. We focus on continuously 
strengthening protection of our company’s technology infrastructure, 
intellectual property and other critical information assets against cyber 
threats.

To enhance our company's competitive advantage and security posture, 
our Enterprise Information Security (EIS) team strives to align our 
security controls to leading industry cybersecurity frameworks, such 
as CIS Critical Security Controls, NIST, COBIT and SOX. These controls 
help us create a strong defense-in-depth, risk-based, scalable and 
outcome-driven cybersecurity program across all our sites.  

Our information security policies and processes provide a foundation for 
our cybersecurity program. Through our periodic mandatory cybersecurity 
awareness training, we educate and evaluate our employees on their 
awareness to protect the intellectual property and information assets 
of AMD, our customers and our vendors. The training includes business 
conduct, ethics and cybersecurity.

AMD implements these information security policies and processes with 
a cross-functional approach. Our Business Information Security Officers 
(BISO) program fosters the active participation of individual business 
units in cybersecurity strategy, risk and control discussions. BISOs are 
responsible for assisting our cybersecurity team with identifying, 
communicating and managing risk, and they help implement appropriate 
security and privacy measures within each BISO’s business organization.

In 2022, AMD did not have any material cybersecurity incidents. The 
conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data are 
vital, and we have organizational, technological, physical and personnel 
controls in place to support these aspects. Our Cyber Operations, Incident 
Command and Response and Insider Threat functions continuously 
monitor the global threat landscape and manage a 24/7 Security 
Operations Center to help protect AMD against, detect and respond 
to potential threats from inside and outside the company.

The Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees 
enterprise risk, and it reviews and provides feedback to EIS on matters
pertaining to information security risk. Internal and external auditors 
conduct periodic audits of our information technology and cybersecurity 
programs and processes. The efforts of the EIS function are overseen 
by management at multiple levels, including our Chief Information 
Officer, AMD Executive Team and Board of Directors.  

Our company’s activities in government and regulatory affairs are overseen 
by our Senior Vice President of Legal and General Counsel, who reports to 
our CEO. The AMD Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct support our 
company’s commitment to high ethical standards and compliance with the 
law in our engagement. Among other terms, the Standards include provisions 
that address political activities and contributions; bribery and anti-corruption; 
and giving or accepting gifts, entertainment and other gratuities.

     Public Policy  

As a global company, we believe CR includes being an active, informed 
participant in the development of public policies that affect our business, 
industry and customers in the countries and communities in which we 
operate. Good public policy begins with diverse stakeholders participating 
in open and transparent proceedings to carefully examine issues and 
offer different perspectives that promote effective solutions.

AMD works with governments and authorities, non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), industry associations and other groups to deepen 
our understanding of different issues and viewpoints and to share our 
experience and expertise as part of an informed public policy development 
process.

Some of the public policy priorities for AMD include:

              Emerging Technologies
              Environmental Protection
              Movement of Goods/IP
              Product Energy Efficiency
              Responsible Supplier Management
              Secure Technology
              Trade, Competition and Market Access

About Our Reporting

Our Value Chain 
Leading companies create opportunities to accelerate 
meaningful action. They do this by deepening their 
understanding of social and environmental issues and 
expanding their view of their responsibilities in these areas. 
They look beyond their own operations and work closely 
with value chain partners and other key stakeholders.

At AMD, we are pushing the boundaries of what we can do by 
embedding corporate responsibility (CR) across our value chain. 
Our approach extends from how our products are designed, 
manufactured and assembled to how they are packaged, shipped 
and used. 

Embedding CR Across our Value Chain 
Our impacts vary throughout the value chain. To put our action in 
context, we have mapped our CR programs and initiatives to the 
primary activities of our value chain.

     Designing

AMD engineers design the circuitry for our broad portfolio of products, 
which includes CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, FPGAs, SoCs and APUs. Our 
employees work at more than 90 locations worldwide.

Product Environmental Sustainability
Product Security

     Silicon Manufacturing  

Our foundry partners manufacture AMD designs on a silicon wafer. 
Typical wafers originate from a cylindrical ingot of high-purity 
monocrystalline silicon, which are sliced into 300mm diameter circular 

wafers of about 0.775 mm thickness. Each wafer undergoes multiple
multiple steps in the wafer fabrication process to produce an AMD-
designed processor or die. The working die is cut from the silicon wafer 
and sent to be assembled into a chip. 

Supply Chain Responsibility
Responsible Mineral Sourcing 

     Assembly and Testing  

In the assembly process, each die is attached to a small interconnection 
board called a substrate so it can function with other devices on a larger 
circuit board. The die on substrate combination is then further assembled 
into a protective package to dissipate heat and protect it from other 
elements. Once fully assembled, each chip is tested for functionality.

Supply Chain Responsibility
Responsible Mineral Sourcing 

     Product Shipping

Qualiﬁed chips are packaged for shipping to our customers. AMD CPUs, 
GPUs, FPGAs and Adaptive SoCs are sold in diverse ways. For CPUs 
and GPUs, AMD works with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) 
that integrate our technology into their branded devices; hyperscale 
and cloud data center providers that integrate our technology into 
their custom-built servers; channel partners that sell standard and 
customized solutions; and retailers that sell processors in a box direct 
to the computer enthusiast community. For FPGAs and adaptive SoCs, 
AMD sells these devices and board-level products primarily through 
channel partners and to direct customers.

Product Environmental Sustainability 
Anti-Counterfeit

     End Product Manufacturing

AMD technology powers billions of intelligent devices made by our 
customers, including PCs, game consoles, servers and industrial devices. 
Following acquisitions in 2022, AMD is powering even more automotive 
and telecommunications applications. These products are deﬁning the 
new era of high-performance and adaptive computing.

Product Security
Industry Collaboration

       Customer Use  

AMD solutions enable people everywhere to realize the full potential of 
their favorite devices and applications and push the boundaries of what 
is possible. The world’s creators, researchers, inventors and explorers are 
using high-performance and adaptive computing to tackle challenges 
across disciplines like science, medicine and manufacturing, transforming 
the lives of those around them.

Supply Chain Responsibility
Responsible Mineral Sourcing 

     Product End of Use

To protect the environment and move toward a more circular economy, 
it is important to promote proper reuse, recycling and disposal of electronic 
products. We are helping make better use of our planet’s limited natural 
resources by engineering our products for longer life, reducing the number 
of devices potentially needed to begin with and, in some cases, helping 
design for modular CPU and GPU upgrades to enable backward compatibility 
with our customers’ existing systems.

About Our Reporting

Digital Impact 
     Why It Matters
Our lives are increasingly dependent on – and intertwined 
with – technology. What we thought was impossible 
yesterday may not only be possible today, but fast 
becoming part of the fabric of our lives. Combined 
with human ingenuity, our advances in semiconductor 
technology and high-performance and adaptive computing 
are accelerating research to enable the solutions we need 
for the future.

AI is the deﬁning technology shaping the next generation of 
computing and our most strategic long-term growth opportunity. 
With this immense opportunity comes the challenge of keeping the 
technology focused on positive outcomes and helping solve some 
of humanity’s most complex problems.

While we take the opportunity to extend our impact by putting leading-
edge technology in the hands of the world’s researchers, entrepreneurs 
and creators, we recognize our industry’s responsibility to protect and 
enable people’s right to share in scientiﬁc advancement and its 
beneﬁts. And while the goal is to improve our world, we recognize 
the potential unintended negative impact our technology could have. 
The same technologies that promote equity and increase efficiency 
can also be deployed in ways that potentially disadvantage vulnerable 
communities or contribute to environmental degradation.

One way to address the opportunities and risks from technology is to 
expand access to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) 
education. According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap 
Report (2018), 75 percent of jobs will be related to STEM areas by 2025 – 
this includes roles at AMD. By inspiring and encouraging tomorrow’s 
leaders, we can help them develop the skills and knowledge they need 
for a STEM career, ultimately helping enable them to make a positive 
impact on society.

     Our Approach

At AMD, we do not operate in isolation: while we create solutions that 
stretch the perception of what is technically possible, we innovate for users. 
We believe that in the hands of the best and brightest, our technology 
can help address our shared challenges, so we can create a better future 
together.

This makes it vital for us to understand the goals of our customers and 
partners and work together to pursue a shared vision. We therefore engage 
and collaborate with stakeholders to design world-class high-performance 
and adaptive computing solutions that users can put to work to spark new 
ideas that beneﬁt society, as well as to mitigate the potential negative 
impacts of the technology itself.

Our approach entails fostering strategic relationships with researchers, 
nonproﬁts, educators and students who are positioned to expand horizons 
and develop the groundbreaking innovations of tomorrow. Whether it is 
donating technology to help develop students’ sense of discovery or 
enabling scientists to responsibly push the boundaries of what is possible, 
we believe that when processing power meets brainpower, the future comes 
alive.

AMD is also committed to working with the industry to innovate and deploy 
AI responsibly. We aim in part to deliver AI solutions, making the beneﬁts 
of AI pervasive while enhancing energy efficiency. We will also work to enable 
an open ecosystem to give broader access of resources to the AI community 
and accelerate innovation. We established an internal cross-functional 
Responsible AI Council that is deﬁning parameters and guidelines based on 
industry frameworks like the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST), UNESCO and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) principles.

We intend to shape both our internal usage of AI and to collaborate with 
the industry to design AI for good while reducing risks. We will invest 
in research and education to increase access to technology and advance 
research to reduce risks and shape public policy. Our Chair and CEO, 
Dr. Lisa Su, sits on U.S. President Joe Biden’s Council of Advisors on Science 
and Technology and is helping to advise policy makers on technology.

About Our Reporting

AMD Adaptive Computing and AI 
Technology Helps Enable HD Ultrasound 
Scanning in Handheld Devices
Ultrasound scanning helps doctors diagnose an array 
of conditions. But many doctors and their patients 
lack access to traditional ultrasound systems, which 
are expensive, large and possibly hard to use. For 
remote locations like the small city of Fernie in 
Canada, patients often have to travel long distances 
in dangerous conditions for a diagnostic ultrasound.

Now, AMD technology is putting diagnostic power 
into the hands of healthcare professionals in more 
settings. AMD Zynq™ UltraScale+™ technology is 
helping Clarius Mobile Health bring high-resolution, 
hospital-quality ultrasound imaging to remote 
locations and small clinics by providing a platform 
where software, automation and AI can be combined.

Similarly, the ultrasound company eZono AG, which 
focuses on point-of-care uses of ultrasound for 
everyday clinical practices, uses AMD technology in 
its eZono 4000 portable ultrasound device. The AMD 
Embedded G-Series Accelerated Processing Unit 
(APU) provides the optimal balance of processing 
performance, 3-D acceleration and power efficiency.

to connect with industry professionals and prepare themselves for 
successful careers in the semiconductor industry. 

At AMD, we take pride in our partnerships with academia and remain 
committed to the continuous advancement of education through our 
University Program. For example, AMD and the University of Strathclyde 
co-developed the new textbook Software Deﬁned Radio with Zynq™ 
UltraScale+™ RFSoC. The book, suitable for seniors, graduate students, 
professors and engineers, teaches the fundamentals of advanced digital 
communication system theory and architecture and how to implement 
them with the AMD Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC platform. 

     Scientiﬁc Research
Together with industry and research partners, AMD is helping to deliver 
a new generation of supercomputers that cross the exascale performance 
barrier for the ﬁrst time, with the ability to perform more than 1018
(one quintillion) or more calculations per second.xi  These pathbreaking

machines will help enable researchers to employ exponentially more
powerful models and simulations with the potential to create 
breakthroughs in areas such as climate science, biomedical engineering 
and the development of new materials.

Originally established in 2020 with a focus on powering research to ﬁght 
the COVID-19 pandemic, the AMD HPC Fund puts computational power 
in the hands of those conducting groundbreaking research to accelerate 
solutions to the world’s toughest challenges.

In 2022, the HPC Fund expanded beyond COVID-19 research to include 
science for the public good  with the addition of 7+ petaﬂops of 
computing power to assist global researchers working on solving the 
most demanding challenges facing society today. Since our acquisition 
of Xilinx, the AMD HPC Fund and Xilinx Heterogeneous Accelerated 
Compute Clusters (HACC) program have integrated, providing researchers 
with access to AMD EPYC™ processors, AMD Instinct™ accelerators, Xilinx 
Alveo™ accelerators and Xilinx Versal™ ACAPs to advance research in areas 
including climate change, healthcare, transportation and big data. 

The additional computing resources build on the original fund, bringing 
the total amount of computing capacity donated by AMD since 2020 to 
nearly 20 petaﬂops with a total market value of more than US$31 million, 
as of the end of 2022. The combined processing power donated through 
the AMD HPC Fund would rank among the fastest supercomputers in the 
world, according to the TOP500 list (June 2023).xiii  

Thirty grantees from nine countries are now beneﬁting from AMD 
hardware and technology via the HPC Fund. At a few institutions, we 
doubled the processing power available on campus. For other grantees, 
this was their ﬁrst opportunity to work on a heterogeneous system with 
AMD CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs, so qualiﬁed support and training were key 
to enabling their research objectives.

The grantees have used the AMD systems for applications such as 
evolutionary modeling of the coronavirus, transmission science and large-
scale ﬂuid dynamics simulations of COVID-19 droplets as they travel 
through the air. This processing power is helping institutions aim to 
tackle previously intractable problems, accelerate response timelines 
and understand biological and medical data on a deeper level.

About Our Reporting

     Heterogeneous Computing Research

Heterogeneous computing involves combining different types of 
processors, such as CPUs, GPUs and adaptive compute accelerators, to 
perform computational tasks more efficiently. The AMD Heterogeneous 
Accelerated Compute Clusters (HACCs) are a joint initiative between 
AMD and ﬁve of the world's leading universities. The HACCs provide 
critical infrastructure and funding to support novel research in high-
performance heterogeneous computing. 

HACCs have been set up at each of the ﬁve partner universities: ETH 
Zurich in Switzerland, the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) 
and the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) in the U.S., 
National University of Singapore (NUS) in Singapore and Paderborn 
University in Germany. Each HACC is equipped with the latest AMD 
EPYC CPUs, Instinct, Alveo and Versal accelerators.

The systems are specially conﬁgured to enable some of the world’s 
leading academics to conduct state-of-the-art heterogeneous 
computing research. Priority areas for the program include HPC, 
machine learning, computer architecture, compilers, energy-efficient 
computing and database acceleration.  

In addition to giving researchers access to the latest AMD technologies, 
the HACC program also fosters interdisciplinary research and 
collaboration. AMD researchers work directly with the HACC user 
community, and the program provides a forum for researchers to 
discuss and share ideas around hardware, software and development 
tools through webinars, tutorials, workshops and user group meetings. 
Over 400 researchers have participated worldwide in the program since 
2020, which has resulted in over 30 publications to date, including two 
best paper awards at international conferences.

     ETH Zurich: Advancing Recommendation 
     Models with AMD Technology

Recommendation models are a type of machine learning tool used by 
online retailers and streaming services to predict user preferences and

suggest personalized products or content. While these models offer  
great beneﬁts for improving the customer experience, they can be 
computationally intensive due to their large size. Typically, a 
combination of CPU and GPU is used to optimize the performance 
of these models. However, by integrating FPGA technology, signiﬁcant 
gains in performance and energy efficiency can be achieved.

The ETH Zurich HACC team collaborates with leading companies to take 
advantage of heterogeneous computing to advance recommendation 
systems. For instance, they developed the ‘FleetRec’ project – a state-
of-the-art large-scale recommendation system on hybrid GPU-FPGA 
clusters.

Professor Gustavo Alonso, head of the Systems group in the computer 
science department at ZTH Zurich and lead for the university’s HACC, 
said, "The HACCs are a unique initiative instrumental in enabling 
innovative and relevant research. They provide researchers with an 
opportunity to develop proof-of-concept prototypes relevant to both 
industry and academia."

     STEM Education 

As we imagine a future enhanced by what computing offers, we must 
also empower tomorrow’s citizens to continue innovating and making 
constructive use of its capabilities. We are passionate about enabling 
the imagination and creativity of the next generation. Technology in 
their hands encourages exploration and learning that open doors to new 
careers and possibilities. This is why we partner with schools, educators 
and local nonproﬁt organizations to outﬁt AMD Learning Labs with AMD 
processor-based equipment, helping inspire students to pursue STEM 
education and empower their teachers. As of December 2022, AMD-
sponsored labs are installed in Markham, Shanghai, Singapore, Penang, 
Austin and San Jose.

These AMD Learning Labs support the expansion of STEM curricula and 
opportunities for students who are under-resourced. They gain hands-on 
experience with computer hardware and software alongside engagement 
with AMD employee volunteers. Students learn to build websites, design
computer games, program in Scratch and Python and improve their

digital literacy skills. For some students, this may lay the groundwork 
for a future technical career, while for others it supports reasoning and 
skills development to thrive in a range of other pursuits.

     Equipping Learning Labs to Support 
     Tomorrow’s STEM Stars

In 2022, AMD expanded its reach with two new Learning Labs at KIPP 
Collegiate High School in Austin and at the Cerebral Palsy Children’s 
Association of Penang. 

KIPP Collegiate High School serves more than 800 students with a focus 
on college and career readiness. Our gift of 25 computer systems beneﬁts 
two Career and Technical Education classrooms and supports learning in 
robotics, engineering, graphics design and animation, engineering design 
and Advanced Computer Science. Students enrolled in these courses 
through the Career and Technical Education program also learn career 
skills, and they can work towards earning certiﬁcations and gain work 
experience via internships.

The Cerebral Palsy Children’s Association of Penang is a nonproﬁt 
organization dedicated to providing comprehensive services for the 
development of people with cerebral palsy. It focuses on special education, 
various therapies, computer education and vocational training to enhance 
the abilities and knowledge of their clients so they can be an integral part 
of the community.

This AMD Learning Lab is equipped with 10 Dell Inspiron computers with 
assistive devices that provide accessibility for all students. With the 
addition of this technology, students learn much needed digital literacy 
skills, including proﬁciency in multiple software applications, such as 
Microsoft Publisher, Microsoft Office 360 and other coding tools. AMD 
also provided funding to update the electrical and cooling systems in the 
lab space to enable a safe and functional environment for the students 
and teachers.

We are not only proud to make products that advance society; we are also 
proud to donate technology that can make a difference in a person’s life.

     Inspiring Students and Strengthening Critical Thinking Skills with Robotics

Robotics is a rapidly evolving ﬁeld, and there is a lot of excitement 
around its potential for increased efficiency, improved safety and the 
development of new technologies. Robotics is also a popular topic in 
education, as it provides an opportunity for students to prepare for 
the jobs of the future in a practical and engaging way.

AMD has been involved with the FIRST® (For Inspiration and 
Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competition since 
2009, when NI’s CompactRIO (powered by AMD FPGAs) became the 
main robotic controller supplied to every team for the FIRST 
competition. That platform was eventually replaced by NI’s roboRIO 
in 2015, which is based on our AMD Zynq™ adaptive SoCs. 

Founded more than 30 years ago, FIRST is a nonproﬁt organization 
that designs accessible, innovative programs that motivate young 
people to pursue education and career opportunities in STEM, while 
building self-conﬁdence, knowledge and life skills.

In 2022, AMD sponsored the ‘Up a Creek’ robotics team during the 
FIRST competition season, where teams of students are challenged 
to design a team brand, hone teamwork skills, engage with the 
community and build and program industrial-sized robots to play 
difficult ﬁeld games against competitors. It is as close to real-world 
engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend 
their time and talent to guide each team. Each season ends with an 
exciting FIRST Championship – and in 2022, the divisional ﬁrst-place 
title went to ‘Up a Creek’ robotics.

"Investing in programs like the FIRST Robotics Competition gives AMD 
the chance to help kids explore their creativity through technology," 
said Salil Raje, senior vice president and general manager of the 
Adaptive and Embedded Computing Group at AMD. "To date, nearly 
2.5 million students have discovered the power of adaptive computing 
through their robot builds."

KTH Breaks New Ground in Science Using 
AMD EPYC™ CPUs and AMD Instinct™ GPUs
High-performance computing (HPC) is increasingly 
important for science research. Now that the 
advancement of human knowledge is frequently 
determined by complex calculations, the more 
processing power researchers can deploy, the more 
discoveries they can potentially make.

Universities around the world are investing in HPC, and 
one of the leading research institutions focusing on this 
area is the KTH Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in 
Sweden. When KTH procured new supercomputing 
resources to enhance its HPC services for the needs of 
Swedish and European research communities, an HPE 
Cray EX cluster powered by AMD EPYC™ processors and 
AMD Instinct™ GPUs offered exceptional performance 
per watt with consumption of about half the power 
compared to competitive offerings. KTH areas of 
research include climate prediction, sustainable sea 
transport and biomolecular modeling.

     Internet of Things (IoT) 
     and Industrial Solutions

Pushing the outermost boundaries of computing includes making more 
powerful, energy-efficient and security-minded processing available 
across a wider spectrum of devices and applications. For example, the 
AMD embedded product portfolio provides the performance and power 
efficiency to enable a variety of Edge computing platforms, putting 
them closer to the end user and source of the data.

We are also paving the way for a new generation of industrial solutions 
enabling intelligent factories. Our solutions serve a wide range of market
segments and help customers realize a future in which things run 
seamlessly, keeping employees productive while they interact more 
naturally and intuitively with the technology around them. For example, 
AMD processor-powered industrial PCs are optimized for exceptional 
power-efficient processing and graphics performance with integrated
CPU and GPU, multi-display support and other advanced features.  

With our recent acquisitions, AMD IoT and industrial solutions 
expanded to applications such as smart grids, trains and railways, 
3D printers and robotics.

     Limiting Potential Negative 
     Impacts of Technology

While we work to enhance and accelerate the possible beneﬁts of 
our technology, we also remain mindful of the potential for negative 
impacts. Potential risks to our industry and society associated with 
technology use include increased energy consumption, threats to 
privacy, human rights abuses and addictive behaviors. 
As a component supplier of semiconductor solutions, AMD is limited 
in our ability to direct or inﬂuence how our products are ultimately used 
by end consumers. Yet we recognize the seriousness of these risks and 
the important part we play in addressing and taking action to help 
reduce them.

Our ongoing efforts include monitoring and disclosing risks to processor 
security, increasing power efficiency in the data center and collaborating 
with industry partners to provide input to policy frameworks and standards. 
For example, AMD actively engages in industry dialogues on these and 
other technological challenges through forums such as the Information 
Technology Industry Council (ITI), the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) 
and the Semiconductor Climate Consortium (sponsored by SEMI).
We will continue working to understand and collaborate more deeply 
on these and other important issues so that the computing we enable 
transforms our world for the better.

Environmental Sustainability 
     Why It Matters
AMD has a part to play in mitigating climate change – 
including making our products more energy efficient 
and by powering the research needed to transition 
to a low-carbon economy. According to the World 
Economic Forum’s 2023 Global Risks Report, ﬁve of 
the top six greatest risks we face as a global community 
based on severity over the next decade are related to 
climate and environmental risks.xv

This is not only a future challenge – the related issues are already 
manifesting. Globally, the 10 warmest years on record have all 
occurred since 2010, with the last nine years (2014-2022) among 
them. The International Panel on Climate Change has stated that 
an average temperature increase of 1.5°C is the threshold for 
dangerous global warming. Beyond this, they foresee a risk 
of severely destabilizing social and economic structures around 
the world.xvii 
An immediate and meaningful global response is required to 
address the climate crisis. Accelerating the transition to a 
sustainable low-carbon economy is intended to produce beneﬁts 
for economic growth, promote the health of people and our 
environment and increase resilience to natural disasters.xviii 
The technology sector plays a critical part in maximizing product 
energy efficiency and enabling opportunities to reduce greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions across society. 

     Our Approach
At AMD, we embrace the responsibility to protect our planet and 
the opportunity to help others save energy and reduce GHG 
emissions. Our environmental programs and initiatives extend 
across our value chain, and we set ambitious goals and publicly 
report annually on our progress.  

Our Approach to Environmental Sustainability 
Is Based on Three Pillars

Addressing Environmental Impacts at AMD and in Our Supply Chain
Reducing AMD operational GHG emissions in line with science-based 
targets, while working closely with direct manufacturing suppliers 
to advance environmental performance.

Advancing Environmental Performance for IT Users 
Optimizing system-level energy efficiency to help our customers and end 
users save energy and advance their sustainability goals.

Innovating on Collaborative Solutions to Address 
Environmental Challenges 
Enabling innovative solutions that optimize renewable energy generation, 
enhance smart solutions and power cutting-edge climate and scientiﬁc 
research.

AMD and our industry continue to mobilize and scale climate 
action, particularly for Scope 3 emissions, which occur outside 
of an individual company’s operations. For instance, CDP
estimates that supply chain emissions are on average 11.4 
times higher than operational emissions.xix Because AMD 
operates in a fabless business model through carefully selected 
external suppliers to manufacture our products, our approach 
to environmental sustainability takes into account where we 
have control and where we have inﬂuence. 

For instance, AMD continues to pursue a science-based GHG 
emissions reduction goal for our operations (aligned with a 1.5˚C 
scenario) while charting a bold path to advance energy efficiency 
for accelerated computing applications. Meanwhile, we work closely 
with direct manufacturing suppliers to increase efficient use 
of resources and renewable energy while investing in stakeholder 
engagement to support industry efforts.

AMD was selected in 2022 to be a founding participant in the 
Responsible Business Alliance’s Senior Environmental Advisory 
Taskforce, in addition to our continued role serving on the Board 
of Directors and as vice chair. The taskforce shapes the 
sustainability strategy for the world's largest industry coalition 
dedicated to CR in global supply chains.

AMD also joined many of our suppliers and customers when 
we became a founding member of the Semiconductor Climate 
Consortium in late 2022 with its focus on GHG emissions across 
the electronics value chain. AMD continues to be an active 
participant and collaborator in several workgroups.

In 2022, AMD was again honored to be named a CDP Supplier 
Engagement Leader for our efforts in the supply chain and 
related goals, governance and industry collaborations. This honor 
is reserved for the top 8 percent of the nearly 20,000 CDP survey 
respondents (in 2022) deemed to be taking leadership actions 
to help reduce emissions and climate risks in the supply chain.

CR Focus Areas

About Our Reporting

     Our Goals and Progress

50 percent reduction in absolute GHG emissions from AMD 
operations by 2030 (base year 2020).

         In 2022, we achieved a 19 percent reduction in our 
         Scope 1 and 2 emissions compared to 2020.vii

30x increase in energy efficiency for AMD processors and 
accelerators powering servers for artiﬁcial intelligence training 
and high-performance computing from 2020-2025.iv

         As of mid-2023, we are on track toward achieving 
         13.5x improvement in energy efficiency for accelerated 
         compute nodes from the 2020 baseline.v

100 percent of AMD direct manufacturing suppliers have public 
emissions reduction goals by 2025.

         In 2022, 70 percent of these suppliers had public GHG goals.x

80 percent of AMD direct manufacturing suppliers source 
renewable energy by 2025.

         In 2022, 68 percent of these suppliers sourced renewable energy.x

Progress on both of our environmental supply chain goals was 
impacted by the addition of new manufacturing suppliers due 
to the acquisitions. Although some suppliers have GHG reduction 
goals and source renewable energy, the overall increase in suppliers 
led to a lower percentage to goal in 2022 compared to 2021.

AMD technology can make a signiﬁcant impact in reducing 
a company’s carbon footprint while maintaining its compute 
performance. In 2022, BNP Paribas opened a data center in 
Sweden, using a circular economy approach. By partnering with 
AMD and others, the new chosen solution not only has a lower 
environmental impact but also makes a positive contribution 
to the local economy.

The data center increases BNP Paribas CIB’s computing grid 
by 20 percentxx. Using direct liquid cooling, the center sells its 
waste heat to the City of Stockholm, where it warms up to 
20,000 homes. BNP Paribas wanted to reduce their carbon 

footprint without compromising on performance, and after 
testing several options, they chose state-of-the-art, high-core 
AMD CPUs that could save up to 30 percent in power consumption 
for the same compute capacity. With more efficient CPUs, per BNP 
Paribas, they could reduce the number of servers they required, 
saving power and cooling costs.

    We are laser focused on improving energy efficiency, doing 
    as much as possible compute per watt of power consumed.

About Our Reporting

Addressing Environmental Impacts  

Our commitment to environmental sustainability is reﬂected in our 
long-standing corporate values and culture. For 28 years, we have been 
transparently reporting on our environmental initiatives and performance. 
With outsourced manufacturing operations, we include supply chain 
manufacturing in the scope of our environmental initiatives and goals, 
in addition to our global operations and product designs. Following the 
acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando in 2022, we are reporting 2022 
calendar year environmental data for the combined company. 

     Operations

Within AMD operations, we aim to reduce energy use and resource consumption 
while aggressively reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (aligned with a 1.5°C scenario 
since 2014). As of December 31, 2022, AMD operated more than 90 locations worldwide, 
including engineering facilities, sales and business service sites and corporate offices. 
Across our facilities, we strive to apply the highest level of integrity and stewardship 
for environmental performance. Our Global EHS Standards provide the corporate-level 
environmental, health and safety framework for the development of best-in-class 
programs for our worldwide operations. These Standards are consistent with widely 
recognized management systems, such as the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard for environmental management. Two of our 
sites – in San Jose, California and Singapore – are certiﬁed to the ISO 14001 standard. 

In line with the ISO 14001 standard, our Global EHS Standards cover 
key environmental elements, including:

            Global Climate Protection
            Pollution Prevention and Resource Conservation
            Waste Management
            Stormwater Protection

     Energy and GHG Emissions

After exceeding our 2014-2020 GHG goal for operations, we set a new 
science-based target (aligned with a 1.5˚C scenario): a 50 percent 
absolute reduction in GHG emissions from AMD operations (Scope 1 
and 2) by 2030 (2020 base year). Following the acquisitions of Xilinx 
and Pensando in 2022, we recalculated our base year energy use and 
operating GHG emissions to reﬂect the combined company.

As a result, our 2020 baseline for energy use changed from 123 to 
199 GWh, and our operating emissions (market-based) changed from 
30,009 to 61,754 metric tco2e. In 2022, we achieved a 19 percent 
reduction in operating emissions (market-based) compared to revised 
2020 baseline. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions have received external 
limited assurance.

Within our operations, our major corporate campuses account for the 
greatest energy use and associated GHG emissions. Our global energy 

use increased 7 percent from 2020 to 2022.xxi We increased the sourcing 
of renewable energy in 2022 to 66 GWh for the combined company. 
This is about 32 percent of our total global energy use (compared to the 
revised 2020 baseline of 18 percent) – enough to power approximately 
9,275 homes in the U.S. for a year.xxii 

AMD is evaluating ways to continue increasing renewable energy 
sourcing over the next three to ﬁve years and beyond, aligned with our 
business strategies. For 2022, in addition to sourcing renewable energy 
from third parties, our San Jose campus utilizes onsite solar generation: 
there is a large 1.4 MW solar system comprised of 3,600 panels elevated 
in the parking lot to provide shade for 500 employee parking spaces. 
The campus also features an additional 600 kW rooftop solar installation. 
The solar conﬁguration can store excess energy generation in a 1 MWh 
battery storage system for later use when building loads are high and 

when utility rates are most expensive. We are also able to send surplus 
energy back to the power grid for the local community to use.

To reduce energy and GHG emissions as outlined in our internal Global 
EHS Standards, major AMD sites maintain an inventory of emissions 
of global warming substances, including GHG emissions resulting 
from the sites’ direct energy use and potential emission sources of 
ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). We employ strategies to reduce 
the emission of global warming substances, eliminate or reduce the 
use of ODSs and decrease the sites’ energy use. We have also identiﬁed 
and implemented additional conservation projects to save electricity. 
In 2022, approximately 20 projects were implemented or recently 
implemented in the previous year, including equipment upgrades and 
optimizations that led to approximately 1.4 million kWh of electricity 
savings during the year.xxiii

     Water and Wastewater
To help reduce our use of water resources and to comply with 
our internal Pollution Prevention Standard, we assess major site 
activities and processes that could have signiﬁcant impacts on 
the environment and put reductions strategies in place. We closely 
manage the environmental impacts of our wastewater and put 
industrial wastewater, stormwater and groundwater strategies 
in place where needed.

In 2022, water use in our operations was 183 million liters. We 
continue to utilize rainwater harvesting and reuse gray water at 
facilities in Austin, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. In 2022, these three 
sites harvested more than 23.9 million liters of rainwater, a 74 
percent increase from 2021 and over 100 percent of their combined 
annual water use. As a result, approximately 7.5 million liters of 
water were returned to local water resources like reservoirs, surface 
ponds and groundwater in communities where we live and work.xxiii

     Waste
AMD aims to reduce the amount of waste produced through 
pollution prevention practices. We characterize, track and manage 
the chemical, electronic and other regulated waste generated onsite 
and through ﬁnal disposition. The waste management facilities and 
transporters we use for the management of regulated waste are 
audited and approved prior to use and periodically to promote a high 
level of care. 

Our total amount of waste generated in 2022 was 816 metric tons, 
comprised of 97 percent non-hazardous and 3 percent hazardous 
waste streams. The non-hazardous waste diversion rate, or the 
amount kept out of landﬁll, was 80 percent in 2022. Efforts include 
recycling and composting 653 metric tons of non-hazardous 
materials. The amount of regulated hazardous waste generated, 
namely in product testing labs, was 24 metric tons in 2022.xxiii 

See our environmental data tables for complete data and footnotes

Supply Chain
 We work with our direct manufacturing suppliersvi to 
advance environmental sustainability across a variety 
of metrics, namely emissions related to purchased goods 
and services (Scope 3 emissions). In 2022, we welcomed 
and integrated several new direct manufacturing suppliers 
into the AMD supply chain responsibility program.

With each direct supplier, our engagement toward assertive, 
forward-looking progress in environmental sustainability is informed 
by the supplier’s situation. Our efforts to advance sustainability in the 
supply chain include participation and even leadership roles in sector 
collaborations driving towards a 1.5°C pathway. 

Silicon wafer manufacturing accounts for the bulk of our environmental 
footprint within our supply chain. Since 2014, we have partnered with 
our direct wafer suppliers to track performance against EHS metrics for 
AMD wafer production. Our work together aims to outperform industry 
averages across metrics that include energy use, GHG emissions, water 
use, hazardous waste recycling and injury and illness rates.

Looking ahead to 2025, we have public goals for all of our direct 
manufacturing suppliers, and we report on our progress annually. 
By 2025, we aim for 100 percent of them to have their own public GHG 
reduction goal(s) and 80 percent to source renewable energy.x Although 
our performance on these goals decreased slightly in 2022 due to the 
addition of new suppliers from the acquisitions, we achieved 70 percent 
of our direct manufacturing suppliers having public GHG goals and 
68 percent sourcing renewable energy in 2022. We are in contact with 
each of our new direct manufacturing suppliers to share information 
about our CR goals and available industry resources.

In 2022, AMD collaborated with the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) 
to host a water conservation webinar for our company and other suppliers 
in Mandarin Chinese. We continue to work with key direct manufacturing 
suppliers to promote water conservation, particularly with factories in high 
water risk regions,xxvii where we expect suppliers to demonstrate water 
conservation and risk mitigation efforts. For example, in 2022, our primary 
wafer foundry supplier, TSMC, was the ﬁrst semiconductor company to 
receive AWS Platinum Certiﬁcation.

     Waste

We work closely with our wafer foundry suppliers to address the 
generation of waste in our supply chain. During 2022, our direct wafer 
manufacturing suppliers achieved a 93 percent hazardous waste 
recycling rate – an increase from 80 percent in 2020.xxvi AMD continues 
to work with these suppliers and other direct manufacturing suppliers 
to track and aim to improve waste metrics, including material reuse 
and waste reduction and diversion programs.

     Energy and GHG Emissions

GHG emissions in our supply chain are primarily generated at silicon 
wafer manufacturing facilities directly through fuel use or indirectly 
through electricity consumption. In 2022, these direct foundry suppliers 
reduced their Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by about 9 percent compared 
to 2020, based on an AMD manufacturing index (MI) accounting for 
wafer size, complexity and quantity.xxv Despite the increased efficiency, 
absolute emissions increased over this time period due to more advanced 
technology nodes that require more electricity and increased desire for 
AMD technology. 

Our aim is to increase renewable energy use by our primary foundry 
manufacturing suppliers by 2x from 2020-2025. We will also begin 
to take steps to forecast GHG emissions in our supply chain and 
identify near-term mitigation efforts. A speciﬁc focus area, which is 
reﬂected in our industry collaborations, is increasing renewable energy 
availability in Taiwan, where most AMD wafers are manufactured. 
Through our founding membership in the SEMI Climate Consortium, 
AMD is encouraging participation by our supplier manufacturers in 
the region to identify key opportunities and barriers for advancing 
renewable energy infrastructure. 

     Water

The contracted wafer manufacturing stage is the point in our value 
chain at which the most amount of water is used and the most 
effluents generated. AMD works closely with our foundry wafer 
suppliers to understand water risks at the locations where AMD 
products are manufactured and to track and manage water use. 
In 2022, the foundries reduced water use by 13 percent from 2020, 
per AMD MI. Despite the improved efficiency, absolute water use 
increased over the same period.xxvi Looking ahead to 2025, we are 
working with our direct wafer manufacturing suppliers to continue 
to reduce water use by a goal of at least 5 percent or more per AMD 
MI compared to 2020. More advanced technology nodes require
more water use during the manufacturing phase, so these suppliers 
are working to increase the capacity for water reclamation.

AMD in North America: Planting 2,000 Trees   
For Earth Day 2022, AMD partnered with nonproﬁt 
Neighborhood Forest on their 13th annual Free Trees for 
Kids program. Neighborhood Forest’s mission is to give 
every child the joy of planting a tree and watching it grow. 
They do this by giving free tree saplings to kids through 
schools, libraries and youth groups for Earth Day. 
Neighborhood Forest plants tens of thousands of trees 
every year and reached their goal of 40,000 trees planted 
in 2022.

AMD committed to plant 2,000 trees across North America 
through a charitable grant to Neighborhood Forest. In 
conjunction with the AMD Go Green employee resource 
group, AMDers across nine sites signed up to plant nearly 
500 trees, and the company donated another 1,500 trees to 
be gifted to children through Neighborhood Forest’s annual 
distribution.

    We are honored and delighted to partner with AMD to give 
    more children this priceless experience. We’re spreading 
    joy and smiles, beautifying neighborhoods, and putting 
    a signiﬁcant dent in our carbon footprint, all while instilling 
    a sense of magic, wonder and love for our planet in the 
    hearts of our little ones.

About Our Reporting

Advancing Environmental 
Performance for IT Users 
We strive to create products that improve people’s lives 
and help our customers and end users reduce their own 
energy use and GHG emissions. We collaborate closely 
with our customers and partners on product design and 
system-level optimizations to advance environmental 
sustainability, including by reducing environmental 
impacts and energy use. 

approximately 29 percent less power and provides estimated GHG 
emission savings equivalent to the carbon sequestration of 38 acres 
of forest in the United States.xxxi 

Energy efficiency is paramount when it comes to supercomputing, 
which is the concentration of processing power across multiple parallel 
computers. AMD powers seven of the top 10 most energy efficient 
supercomputers, according to the Green500 List published in June 2023, 
and we received a 2022 SEAL Sustainable Product Award for innovative 
and impactful products ‘purpose-built’ for a sustainable future in data 
centers. 

     Product Energy Efficiency 
Maximizing the computing performance delivered per watt of 
energy consumed is a vital aspect of our business strategy. 
Our products’ cutting-edge chip architecture, design and power 
management features have resulted in signiﬁcant energy 
efficiency gains. For example, AMD Ryzen™ processors are 
continuing to help deliver energy-efficient laptops without 
compromise, including our Ryzen 7 6800U processors with 
up to 57 percent better power efficiency than ENERGY STAR 
8.0 requirements.xxviii An enterprise that upgrades 50,000 PCs 
using Ryzen 7 6800U processors instead of Intel Core i7-1280P 
processors would save approximately 2.2 million kWh of 
electricity and 1,580 metric tons of emissions.xxix 

In the data center, AMD EPYC™ processors power the most energy-
efficient x86 servers, delivering exceptional performance and 
reducing energy costs.xxx AMD EPYC™ processor-based technology 
drives energy efficiencies by meeting application performance 
demands with fewer physical servers than competitive solutions, 
which can result in a reduced data center footprint and associated 
energy use and GHG emissions. For example, to deliver 2,000 virtual 
machines, it takes an estimated 11 2P AMD EPYC™ 9654-powered 
servers or 17 2P Intel Platinum 8490H-based servers. The AMD 
solution takes an estimated 35 percent fewer servers, uses

About Our Reporting

     Lifecycle Management  

By engineering our products for longer life, reducing the number 
of devices potentially needed to begin with, piloting product takeback 
initiatives and, in some cases, designing for backward compatibility 
with our customers’ existing systems, we can help make better use 
of our planet’s limited natural resources.

At AMD, we take our commitment to supporting long product 
lifecycles very seriously. For example, in 2022, AMD announced that 
we are extending the product lifecycle for all Xilinx 7 Series devices 
launched between 2011-2015 until at least 2035. By designing these 
long-lasting products, which are used in markets like industrial, 
automotive, aerospace and medical, we can help reduce the 
environmental impacts associated with manufacturing new products.

In the data center, AMD EPYC processors are designed to meet 
application performance demands with fewer servers. As a result, 
data centers can reduce electricity use and GHG emissions for IT 
infrastructure as well as for cooling data centers, while avoiding added 
raw materials that need to be extracted, shipped, manufactured and 
disposed of. In many cases, AMD powered server and desktop CPU 
sockets are backward compatible with the previous generation 
processor, meaning the CPU can be upgraded using the existing 
motherboard. As a result, processing power can be increased without 
the cost or environmental impact of replacing the entire system.

     Product Takeback

In 2022, AMD, in partnership with Microsoft, launched a regional pilot 
product takeback campaign in Indonesia and Vietnam for customers 
to trade in used electronics and upgrade to a new Windows 11 PC 
powered by an AMD RyzenTM processor. Based on positive feedback 
from users, this initiative will be expanding to South Korea and 
potentially to otherregions in 2023. The efforts aim to address a 
societal challenge related to the approximate 40 million metric tons 

of electronic waste (e-waste) generated every year, with only 12.5 percent 
recycled according to some sources.xxxii This means that most e-waste 
is sent to landﬁlls and incinerators, releasing harmful toxins into the air. 
By trading in old devices, we can help give old tech a new life and reduce 
our impact on the planet by encouraging the recycling and proper disposal 
of e-waste while also improving energy efficiency.

     Reducing Hazardous Substances

AMD is committed to promoting the highest levels of compliance across 
the many standards that govern different industry management systems. 
As a member of JEDEC, AMD works with customers and suppliers to comply 
with industry standards. We strive to help reduce the amount of hazardous 
substances in our products. AMD complies certiﬁcations and standards, 
such as RoHS and REACH, to meet the highest requirements for quality, 
safety and environmental protection.

For more information, please visit our product environmental compliance.

     Product Packaging 
Packaging materials are used for the shipping and handling of our products 
to consumers – both processors in a box (PIBs), graphics cards, FPGAs and 
adaptive SoCs, evaluation boards, system-on-modules and Alveo accelerator 
cards. AMD speciﬁes the packaging materials used, including the recyclability 
of materials and the use of recycled content. We offer packaging that meets 
the amended requirements of the EU Packaging Directive (94/62/EC).

Smaller packaging conserves natural resources and reduces shipping fuel 
use and emissions per unit. In 2022, we continued to reduce the size of our 
packaging for select Ryzen PIBs by an average of 66 percent compared to 
the previous generation.xxxiii Our packaging designers continuously seek out 
environmentally preferable packing materials, including non-toxic dyes.  

Innovating on Collaborative Solutions 
AMD collaborates with enterprises, researchers and others 
to help them put our technology to work solving some of 
the world’s most pressing environmental challenges.

     Circular Economy   

Imagine a world where the performance and upgradability of a desktop 
is blended with the ﬂexibility of a laptop. To help make this a reality, 
in 2023 we collaborated with Framework: a laptop manufacturing 
company that aims to reduce environmental impact by designing modular 
products to last longer through easy repair and upgrade, maximizing the 
use of recycled and recyclable materials and ﬁnding ways to extend life 
through reuse. Framework also works with carbon sequestering company 
Running Tide to purchase carbon capture in order to make each laptop 
carbon neutral.

Together with Framework, we were able to realize the vision of portability, 
sustainability and performance all in one incredible system: user 
upgradeable laptops powered by AMD. These modular computers have 
powerful Ryzen processors and Radeon graphics to deliver the most 
advanced performance.xxxiv 

     Clean Energy

In 2022, AMD EPYC™ processors helped entrepreneur Accelerate Wind 
to design more efficient rooftop wind turbines by increasing its turbine 
simulation performance by 15 times. AMD EPYC processors also continued 
to optimize wind turbine orchestration for energy solutions company 
Vestas so that power lost due to wake turbulence can be reduced for 
greater renewable energy generation and improved value. Going back 
over a decade, AMD embedded solutions have been used in wind turbines 
to help optimize the production of clean energy.

       Cloud Computing

     Climate Research   

AMD server processors are also helping to advance the adoption of cloud 
computing, which is forecast to prevent emissions of more than 1 billion 
metric tons of CO2 from 2021-2024 due to higher server utilization rates, 
more energy efficient operations and more renewable energy sourcing.xxxv
AMD EPYC processors are used to power cloud instances ranging from 
big data analytics to virtual desktops. As more enterprises move their 
computing applications from on-premises data centers to cloud-based 
data centers, they may see server utilization rates increase, more efficient 
energy use and new possibilities for renewable energy sourcing.  

While helping to enable solutions to reduce energy and carbon emissions, 
AMD also aims to help researchers better understand the interrelated 
forces contributing to climate change and develop solutions to help 
mitigate the impact. By analyzing massive and complex data sets, 
scientists can learn insights into the causes of climate change and even 
predict the impact of extreme weather to help save lives. For example, two 
of the AMD-powered Top 500 Supercomputers (June 2023) – the Meteo 
France supercomputer and the LUMI supercomputer in Finland – are used 
for weather and climate research.

       Entertainment
Imagination knows no limits in the entertainment world. That is why 
AMD pushes for faster rendering with the world’s most advanced 
processor. From special effects to virtual production to 3D modeling, 
we are empowering ﬁlm, television and game creators to realize their 
visions. AMD is a proud founding member of the Greening of Streaming, 
a user group of like-minded technology and service provider organizations 
that are focused on establishing standards and practices to improve 
sustainability in the streaming industry. AMD is also an active and proud 
contributor to working group six, working collaboratively to deﬁne the 
Low Energy Sustainability Streaming (LESS) Accord, which aims to set 
standards around sustainable streaming.  

     Eco-Labels  
AMD works closely with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) 
during product design and after product launch to increase the 
proportion of products meeting various eco-labels. As government 
agencies around the world look to incorporate sustainability 
requirements into their IT buying decisions, they use standards such 
as ENERGY STAR, EPEAT, TCO and others in their public procurement 
tenders. Most eco-labels and certiﬁcations are evaluated at the system 
level, (i.e., a computer or server), but the processor can contribute to 
how well a system performs on a given standard.

For example, AMD works with our customers to help improve ENERGY 
STAR ratings by optimizing processor energy efficiency as measured 
at the system level, in conjunction with other components and peripheral 
devices.  AMD also helps OEMs to meet the system-level eco-label 
certiﬁcation EPEAT, which includes environmental criteria such as supply 
chain greenhouse gas reductions, materials selection and environmental 
management system certiﬁcation. 

     Communications  
As data consumption continues to grow rapidly, driven by technologies 
such as streaming services and 5G broadband connectivity, AMD 
processors are helping meet demand while reducing power consumption. 
For example, France-headquartered Ateme achieved approximately 
a 50 percent reduction in power consumption with its advanced video 
encoding platform enabled by AMD EPYC processors, while delivering 
better video quality. On broadband infrastructure where data 
consumption is growing by 30 percent per year according to experts, 
cloud-native software and physical broadband technology solutions 
provider Casa Systems was able to break the record for throughput by 
using 3rd generation AMD EPYC to achieve their goal of industry-leading 
performance and carbon footprint reduction from 5G networks.

Video content distribution poses a performance 
challenge for data center hardware while delivering 
the performance cost-effectively. Broadcasting 
joint venture JOCDN is at the forefront of delivering 
video in the Japanese market. The company is 
constantly looking for the best processing power 
for the money, to maintain competitiveness and 
enable the development of new services. When 
JOCDN started to ﬁnd its existing infrastructure 
was limiting its opportunities for growth, the 
company began looking for an alternative platform. 
JOCDN deployed 32-core 2nd Gen AMD EPYC 7502P 
processors to double throughput while reducing 
CPU usage by about 40 percent and power 
consumption by about 20 percent compared 
to its previous servers. In other words, JOCDN 
was able to spend less on energy with AMD 
EPYC processors for a comparable workload, while 
still having capacity for future load increases as 
its business expands.

Supply Chain Responsibility
     Why It Matters
AMD is a key part of an extensive global supply chain creating 
products to advance high-performance and adaptive computing 
that helps to enable the future. By using our collective inﬂuence, 
the semiconductor industry’s supply chain continues to be 
one of the most important levers for creating a positive impact 
in the world. According to one analyst, each segment of the 
semiconductor value chain has, on average, 25 countries involved 
in the direct supply chain and 23 countries involved in supporting 
market functions.xxxvi  Supply chain sustainability can make a 
signiﬁcant impact on advancing human rights, fair labor practices 
and environmental progress.

While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic began to ease in 2022, 
our supply chain must remain resilient; some experts expect increased 
demand for semiconductors across the industry over the next decade.xxxvii 
Semiconductors have become essential to our modern world,xxxviii and their 
end users are increasingly diverse. This brings a responsibility to take 
individual and collective steps for our products to be produced responsibility 
and ethically. Consequently, stakeholder expectations for transparency 
and data-driven results will remain a focus for our company in 2023.

Together with our supply chain and industry partners, AMD embraces the 
opportunity to meet demand while driving social and environmental 
progress in the supply chain. We are committed to delivering high-quality 
products and helping enable working conditions throughout our supply 
chain to be safe, workers are treated with respect and dignity and the 
manufacturing processes of our products are environmentally responsible.

     Our Approach

As AMD is a fabless semiconductor company, our manufacturing 
operations depend on a carefully selected network of suppliers. 
The scope of the AMD Supply Chain Responsibility (SCR) program 
encompasses the manufacturing of our products by suppliersix
located in Asia, Europe and the United States and the sourcing 
of raw materials. The acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando in 2022 
expanded our supply chain; we incorporated both companies' 
manufacturing suppliersix into the AMD SCR program by 
communicating AMD expectations and conducting assessments 
with new suppliers. In 2022, we also expanded the SCR requirements 
to major indirect suppliers based on AMD spend and risk assessment 
to human rights.xxxix 

Our value chain starts with the design process. Our wafer foundry 
suppliers source raw materials and create a silicon wafer. The wafer 
is fabricated into chips, assembled into a package, tested and 
shipped as a semiconductor ready to be used by our customers. 

Following the acquisitions in 2022, the majority of our supplier 
spend – approximately 62 percent – is with foundries that supply 
these wafers. Another 25 percent of our spend is with factories that 
manufacture a range of inputs needed to create our products.ix 
Concentrating our spend on key manufacturing suppliers enables 
us to take a long-term approach with them, which is paramount 
to our success. AMD primary manufacturing suppliers include Global
Foundries, Micron, Samsung Electronics, SPIL, SK hynix, TF-AMD 
and TSMC.

     Our Goals and Progress

100 percent of AMD direct supplier manufacturing factories to have 
a Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) audit or equivalent by 2025 
(base year 2020).

            Between 2020 and 2022, 74 percent of these supplier 
            factories had an RBA audit.x

80 percent of AMD direct manufacturing suppliersix by spend 
to participate in a capacity-building activity by 2025.

            81 percent of these suppliers by spend participated 
            in capacity-building activities in 2022.viii

Although AMD achieved this goal in 2022, we will continue to engage 
suppliers in capacity-building activities on topics such as setting 
GHG reduction targets, sourcing renewable energy, ethical recruitment 
and worker engagement.

Partnering with SEMI to Address the Environmental 
Challenges Facing the Semiconductor Industry

In late 2022, AMD became a founding member of the newly formed Semiconductor 
Climate Consortium, a group formed by companies in the semiconductor ecosystem 
focused on the challenges of climate change. Aligned with the Paris Agreement, 
the Consortium works to speed industry value chain efforts to reduce GHG emissions 
in member company operations and in other sectors of our value chain.

In addition to AMD, the Consortium has grown to about 80 semiconductor companies 
including Applied Materials, ASML, GlobalFoundries, Micron, Samsung Electronics, 
SK hynix and TSMC. Member companies collaborate with the aim of identifying 
solutions that can reduce the environmental impact of the semiconductor industry, 
such as reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions, improving water usage 
efficiency and promoting the use of renewable energy. 

As a fabless semiconductor company, our scope 3 emissions exceed our scope 1 
and 2 emissions. As this newly formed group aims to progress its work, AMD is 
engaging with industry participants to explore opportunities to reduce emissions. 
AMD participates in discussions to explore the challenges and opportunities for our 
suppliers to access renewable energy in regions worldwide. AMD also joined the 
Environmental Risk Reporting and Mitigation Working Group.

The Consortium also engages with policymakers, NGOs and other stakeholders to 
promote sustainable practices in the semiconductor industry and advocate for 
policies that support the transition to a low-carbon economy.

     Respecting Human Rights
At AMD, we respect human rights throughout our 
company, operations and supply chain. We work 
to uphold the relevant fundamental rights and 
freedoms of all people across the business, in line 
with the United Nations Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Labour 
Organization’s (ILO’s) Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work, the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
(UNGPs) and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises. The AMD CR and Legal teams are 
responsible for establishing and coordinating the 
policies, programs and processes that govern our 
approach to human rights.

Our Human Rights Policy reﬂects our commitment to the 
UNGPs. This policy extends to our supply chain, and the 
AMD Supplier Code of Conduct further incorporates human 
rights requirements expressed in international norms and 
standards. 

In 2023 we worked with BSR, a global sustainable business 
network and consultancy, to conduct our ﬁrst Human 
Rights Saliency Assessment. We prioritized the timing
of this exercise to follow our major acquisitions in 2022 
and reﬂect expansion of our global presence and products.

BSR conducted the assessment in alignment with the UNGPs 
to identify the most important (salient) human rights issues 
for AMD based on the risk of severity of impact to rightsholders 
and the likelihood of their occurrence. The process included 
input from AMD executives, customers, suppliers and 
international NGOs.

As a result of the assessment, AMD gained a more holistic 
view of where our human rights risks lie, how they are 
interconnected, how to prioritize them and what areas 
merit deeper examination. We are using this information 
to take the next steps in expanding our human rights 
strategy.

AMD was included in the KnowTheChain benchmark for the 
ﬁrst time in 2022; we ranked 14 out of a total of 60 companies 
in the ICT sector benchmark. AMD was highlighted for being 
one of only a few companies that monitor the repayment 
of fees below a tier one manufacturing supplier. We gained 
valuable insight into where we should focus improvement 
efforts, and starting in 2023, we are incorporating this 
information into our programming.

            Establishing contractual obligation to SCR requirements

            Understanding and addressing geographic risks, labor trends 
            and environmental risks

In 2022, 100 percent of AMD Sourcing Managers completed the 
annual training course on supply chain responsibility, which included 
our Supplier Code of Conduct standards, preventing risks of forced 
labor to vulnerable workers and supplier performance. 

     Aligning with Industry Standards 

AMD is a full member and vice chair of the Responsible Business 
Alliance (RBA). AMD adopts the RBA Code of Conduct as our Supplier 
Code of Conduct (The Code). The Code is aligned with international 
norms and standards, including: 

            The Universal Declaration of Human Rights

            Integrating SCR into our business decisions through collaboration 
            between Procurement, Finance and Corporate Responsibility teams

            ILO International Labour Standards 

            Partnering with direct manufacturing suppliers to foster best 
            practices of SCR through audits, remediation and capacity-building

            Participating in industry groups to drive collective change – AMD 
            is a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), 
            Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI) and Responsible Minerals 
            Initiative (RMI), among others

            UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 

            The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
            (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises 

It outlines our supply chain standards for labor, health and safety, 
environment, ethics and management systems.

            Aligning with international standards – The AMD Supplier Code 
            of Conduct and AMD policies are aligned with international norms 
            and standards, including the Universal Declaration of Human 
            Rights and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
            Rights at Work

Our SCR program resides under the Corporate Responsibility (CR) team, 
which reports to our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate 
Secretary, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The CR team works 
cross-departmentally to help operationalize the day-to-day management 
of our program and policies. Our Corporate Vice President of Purchasing 
receives updates on supplier performance to SCR requirements quarterly 
and more frequently when necessary.

The AMD Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct outline our 
expectations for our ethical conduct, and these standards extend to 
our key business partners and suppliers. Because we want them to help 
expand the reach even further, we require each direct manufacturing 
supplier to communicate the same expectations to their suppliers in 
turn and implement reasonable mechanisms to monitor their compliance.

About Our Reporting

     Stakeholder Engagement

Stakeholder expectations related to the supply chain continue to evolve, 
raising opportunities for increased collaboration to tackle some of the 
world’s most important challenges. We believe collective action drives 
greater impact than one company acting alone. For this reason, multi-
stakeholder partnerships are an important aspect of managing our supply 
chain responsibly.

AMD collaborates with industry groups, peers, suppliers and other 
stakeholders to make supply chains across the industry ethical and 
sustainable. In 2021, AMD was elected to the Responsible Business 
Alliance Board of Directors to help guide its strategic direction toward 
achieving its mission and vision. Over the past two years AMD has advised 
RBA on enhancing its risk assessment tools, prioritizing focus on climate 
change mitigation efforts and strengthening relationships with public 
policy makers and other industry groups.

We actively participate in the Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI), which helps 
us keep current on regional industry hiring trends, potential risks and best 
practices. We utilize RLI’s tools to support a harmonized approach to 
address the root cause of forced labor risks and accelerate positive change 
for the workers in our supply chain.

We also work with our suppliers and our industry through the Responsible 
Mineral Initiative (RMI) to promote the responsible sourcing of raw minerals. 
The RMI is a central actor that helps members advance responsible mineral 
sourcing by promoting common tools, assessments, training and on-the-
ground projects for the electronics industry and beyond. We encourage our 
suppliers to utilize RMI tools and best practices to implement industry 
alignment across the value chain.

AMD is a member of Information Technology Industry Council (ITI). We 
actively participate in several ITI committees, including Environment and 
Sustainability, advising on how the broader technology industry contributes 
to responsible sourcing within global supply chains and addressing climate 
change. 

Additionally, in 2022, AMD joined two groups to help advance industry-
wide supply chain environmental sustainability. AMD was chosen to 
serve on the newly formed advisory group, the RBA Senior Environmental 
Advisory Taskforce. In this position, we will help guide RBA’s strategic 
direction of climate change mitigation. AMD also became a founding 
member of the newly formed Semiconductor Climate Consortium 
established by companies across the semiconductor value chain to 
accelerate the ecosystem’s reduction of GHG emissions.xl

     Risk Assessment 
Although we strive to adhere to the highest standards and support our 
suppliers to do the same, social and environmental risks in the supply 
chain persist and will continue to evolve. At AMD, we take a risk-based 
approach to managing our supply chain, which includes utilizing data 
from various sources to identify areas of risk. With the expansion of 
our supply chain, as of 2023, AMD conducts a social and environmental 
risk assessment on potential new direct manufacturing suppliers as part 
of the qualiﬁcation process.

The RBA risk assessment tool accounts for factory location, product type 
and country risk, providing us with insight into the inherent risks in our 
supply chain. AMD requires all direct manufacturing suppliers to complete 
the RBA Corporate Self-Assessment Questionnaire (Corporate SAQ) and 
Facility Self-Assessment Questionnaire (Facility SAQ) which serve as 
additional input to the risk analysis. Results of the SAQ combined with 
the inherent risk score produce an overall risk score, which inﬂuences our 
approach to supplier engagement. The Facility SAQ is an important tool 
that helps us monitor the risk of forced labor. 

We isolate questions from the RBA Facility SAQ to identify direct 
manufacturing suppliers that use labor agents to provide foreign or 
migrant workers and review whether they:

            Have a policy for workers to not pay employment related fees 

            Reimburse workers in the event a worker paid a fee related 
            to employment

            Provide 100 percent of workers a written contract in their 
            native language

            Have a policy stating personal documents are not to be held 
            by the company

AMD engages any direct manufacturing supplier that does not meet 
these criteria to reiterate the requirements and obtain evidence that 
they are promptly met.

In our supplier assessments we also use research reports, including the 
RLI Labor Migration Corridor Database, which provides data on high-risk 
migration corridors and average employment fees and publications by 
NGOs and academics. Additionally, we take part in multi-stakeholder 
discussions to inform emerging risk.

About Our Reporting

     Assessing Impact and Opportunities  

Our standard contractual terms and conditions for the procurement 
of goods and services require conformance to our Code of Conduct 
and applicable laws and regulations. We also continually work to 
streamline and reinforce our expectations through regular supplier 
communications. For example, in 2022, we launched the AMD Supplier 
Responsibility Guide. This guide enables us to formally share our 
expectations with our direct manufacturing suppliers and provide 
resources to support their success. These suppliers can now share the 
AMD Supplier Responsibility Guide with their suppliers, thus extending 
our expectations further upstream in the supply chain. Pursuant to our 
supply chain responsibility audit goal, we use third-party audits where 
available, to verify the supplier has a policy and systems in place to 
communicate our expectations to their suppliers and monitor their 
compliance. 

Supply chain responsibility performance is incorporated into the 
overall supplier scorecards we use to incentivize suppliers for strong 
labor and environmental performance. AMD employees from the 
Procurement and CR teams participate in supplier business reviews, 
which include a discussion on the scorecard. Performance metrics 
include: 

            Social and environmental commitment and management 

            RBA Code of Conduct conformance performance  

            Timely closure of nonconformance, if any   

            Environmental management and performance

            Commitment to continuous improvement 

We recognize many of the industry’s SCR challenges and 
opportunities reside beyond our direct manufacturing suppliers. 
In 2022, we participated in industry workgroups to evaluate 
approaches and tools for mapping the industry’s supply chain. 
In addition, we piloted an initiative to extend visibility to sub-tier 
suppliers.

     Capacity-Building Programs 

Based on our research and information learned through supplier SAQs, 
we prioritize training for direct manufacturing suppliers that employ 
at-risk, vulnerable groups in our supply chain. Our capacity-building 
programs in 2022 focused on equipping them with knowledge and tools 
to prevent forced labor in their workplaces with a focus on best practices 
when recruiting and employing migrants. For the second year in a row, 
AMD sponsored a supplier to attend the RLI’s Ethical Recruitment Due 
Diligence training workshop. The workshop included best practices to 
protect workers from COVID-19 and focused on key risks in the recruitment 
of foreign migrant workers: document retention, contract terms and 
conditions and recruitment fees and related costs. As a result, the supplier 
hosted a training to increase awareness among foreign migrant workers

on how to mitigate the risk of contracting COVID-19 while living in 
dormitories and made adjustments to the transportation schedule 
to allow for increased social distancing. Additionally, management 
updated its grievance procedure to streamline communication with 
migrant workers. As well, suppliers in Taiwan participated in training 
speciﬁc to local, forced labor risks. 

We also assigned training through the Responsible Business Alliance 
(RBA)’s e-Learning Academy based on identiﬁed knowledge gaps. 
For example, in 2022, suppliers took training on social responsibility 
supply chain management, forced labor prevention and managing air 
emissions. This training was available at no cost to the suppliers, 
on-demand in multiple languages.

About Our Reporting

     Supplier Performance 

As part of our goal for 100 percent of our direct supplier manufacturing 
factories to have a Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) audit or 
equivalent by 2025, we prioritize factories for third-party RBA audit based 
on risk proﬁle, percentage of AMD spend and past audit performance. 
Each year we report publicly on our direct manufacturing suppliers’ annual 
audit nonconformances, and each quarter we review related performance 
with our Global Operations executive team. This review covers priority and 
major nonconformances from these audits, corrective action plan status, 
including closure rates, and overall  performance.

In 2022, within our direct manufacturing supplier base, 55 RBA Validated 
Assessment Program (VAP) audits took place across Greater China, Japan, 
Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and the United States.xli  The 
average initial VAP audit score for AMD suppliers in 2022 was 13 percent 
better than the overall RBA average over the same time period.

See our direct manufacturing supplier audit summary results

     Remediation 

Suppliers are expected to take action to remedy nonconformances and to 
prevent possible future negative impacts. Based on RBA protocols, AMD 
monitors improvement by measuring the number of priority violations, 
repeated violations, frequency of nonconformances and Corrective Action 
Plan (CAP) closure status. We track nonconformances from the release 
of the audit report through closure.

In some cases, suppliers are required to create a CAP and share it with 
AMD, ensuring they meet the deadlines and requirements set out by 
the RBA VAP Protocol. In some cases, they may need to arrange an 
onsite third-party closure audit or submit sufficient evidence addressing 
the root cause of the issue.

We engage with suppliers and support them to remedy their 
nonconformances by creating and closing the CAP. When necessary, 
AMD Sourcing Managers support suppliers to adhere to improvements 
and the associated deadlines. Depending on the severity of the issue, 

discussions may be elevated for a more in-depth conversation between 
company executives. As we engage with a supplier in this process, if they 
are not following the RBA CAP closure timeline, AMD executives will be 
informed so appropriate action can be taken.

Workers are one of our key stakeholder groups. Third-party audits are 
a valuable tool to assess whether workers have access to mechanisms 
to voice concerns, if any, and access remedy when needed. As part of the 
RBA audit protocol, some workers have the opportunity to be interviewed 
and this feedback provides insight into actual workplace conditions. 
Additionally, RBA tracks a Quality of Life Metric.xlii This metric is based 
on three indicators: availability of money (having more than is needed 
to pay personal bills), time (to focus on enjoyable things) and good health 
(in order to enjoy the money and time). The score is calculated by isolating 
questions in the VAP audits that measure these three indicators. Workers 
in the AMD supply chain scored 57.6 on RBA’s Quality of Life Metric, 
compared to the industry average of 51.9. In 2023, we plan to launch our 
ﬁrst worker voice survey, as a pilot for future expansion.    

     Environmental Sustainability 
     in Our Supply Chain

We are steadfast in our commitment to environmental sustainability, and 
that includes working with our direct manufacturing suppliers to evaluate 
and continuously improve performance. Given the amount of energy and 
water needed in the wafer fabricating process, silicon wafer manufacturing 
represents the bulk of our environmental footprint in our supply chain.
We have set 2025 performance metrics for our wafer foundry suppliers, 
and we track progress each quarter. In addition, we track water use, energy 
use, GHG emissions and waste across our direct manufacturing suppliers. 
For several years AMD has collected this data from about the top 80 
percent of our direct manufacturing suppliers by spend. In 2021, this data 
collection and engagement represented 89 percent (by spend); and in 2022 
we expanded to approximately 95 percent (by spend).

AMD has again been recognized by CDP as a Supplier Engagement 
Leader (2022), an honor awarded to only the top 8 percent of CDP survey 
respondents. Our efforts in 2022-23 prioritized climate challenges in 

the supply chain, both through broader industry efforts as well as direct
supplier engagements. For example, we worked with several individual 
suppliers and the RBA to strengthen expectations and resources for 
manufacturers to set science-based targets for their Scope 1 and 2 
emissions.

     Responsible Mineral Sourcing  

Tracing the origin of minerals to the point of extraction is a complex 
challenge but is essential to a responsible and resilient supply chain. 
AMD efforts to break the link between the minerals trade and conﬂict 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo began in 2008. Through industry 
initiatives and collaboration with our supply chain, we work to support 
the responsible sourcing of minerals from conﬂict-affected and high-risk 
areas (CAHRAs), including the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
adjoining countries. As we learn more about potential social and 
environmental impacts, we continue to assess our supply chain, and 
we have prioritized minerals beyond tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold 
(3TG) and cobalt for additional due diligence.

Our approach is based on the ﬁve steps of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for 
Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conﬂict-Affected and High-
Risk Areas (OECD Guidance). To enhance our due diligence, we focus on 
managing risks and improving traceability in the supply chain.

AMD works with direct manufacturing suppliers to map the relevant 
smelters and reﬁners within our supply chain utilizing the RMI’s reporting 
templates, suchas the Conﬂict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT). 
In 2022, we updated our Responsible Minerals Policy (previously called the 
Conﬂict Minerals Policy) to progress our desire to expand due diligence 
globally and to a broader set of materials. We surveyed AMD direct 
manufacturing suppliers for 10 new materials beyond 3TG and cobalt.

We encourage smelters and reﬁners in our supply chain to participate 
in an independent third-party assessment such as the RMI’s Responsible 
Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). These audits aim to verify responsible 
parties conduct due diligence on materials purchased from mining

companies or mineral traders and implement corrective actions to 
comply with industry standards. We leverage our participation in RMI 
to do this, and we contact smelters and reﬁners directly when they 
are at risk of not completing the RMAP CAP process or are unwilling 
to maintain the RMAP certiﬁcation.  

We continue to maintain 100 percent of smelters and reﬁners 
participating in RMAP. Our primary goal is to work with direct 
manufacturing suppliers to support improvement when necessary, 
but in some cases, it becomes necessary for AMD to require these 
suppliers to disengage from a smelter or reﬁner when our industry 
standards are not met. This can have unintended economic and 
humanitarian consequences for local communities. AMD has strong 
partnerships with our direct suppliers. Therefore, we work together 
to assess the impacts of disengaging from raw material sources 
and together promote responsible sourcing.

Learn more about our responsible minerals program 

     Supplier Diversity 

We are committed to growing diversity in our workplace, supply chain and 
industry at large to help embrace different viewpoints and experiences, 
foster innovation, challenge the status quo when needed and drive 
business performance. In the supply chain, we have a geographically diverse 
set of suppliers, including manufacturing suppliers in Asia, Europe and 
North America, as well as thousands of non-manufacturing suppliers globally.

In 2022, AMD (excluding the recent acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando) 
spent US$14.9 million with diverse suppliers in the U.S. – approximately 
52 percent more than in 2021.xliii The available spend data is from registered 
U.S. businesses that include women-owned (US$8.3 million), minority-owned 
(US$5.7 million), small (US$3.8 million) and veteran-owned (US$57,600) 
businesses. AMD may have spent more with minority suppliers but this is 
not known, because we rely on supplier-reported designations.

In 2022, AMD supported small businesses by engaging in various 
initiatives. We were proud to partner with our customer Lenovo on their 
Evolve Small initiative that funds grants, technology upgrades and 
mentorship opportunities for small businesses throughout the U.S. and 
Canada. For instance, 30 grant businesses were identiﬁed to receive 
12 months of mentorship and networking from Goodie Nation (a nonproﬁt 
partnering with Lenovo), up to US$10,000 each and an AMD-powered 
Lenovo ThinkBook laptop.xliv Leadership of the small businesses were also 
invited to participate in a mental wellness session with a small business 
coach and therapist. Through the initiative, these small businesses received 
technological support to strengthen their systems and processes to help 
elevate their day-to-day business operations. 

AMD also co-sponsors the Data Trade Gateway program, which is in 
partnership with North Carolina State University. Professors at ﬁve North 
Carolina Historically Black Colleges and Universities (Bennett College, 
Fayetteville State University, Johnson C. Smith University, Winston-Salem 
University and Livingstone College) teach students how to use data analytics 
and visualization software. Each of the students is paired with a local black-
owned business to apply analytics to a real-world problem that the business 
is trying to solve. Each of the students and business owners received a 
Lenovo AMD ThinkBook laptop to support the software and their growth. 
This program ran through the Spring semester of 2023.

     Health and Safety for Workers 
     in Our Supply Chain 

We value the health and safety of workers in our supply chain. With our two 
primary wafer foundry suppliers, we aim to see a year-over-year reduction 
of the cumulative reportable injury and illness case ratexlv in 2022, the rate 
increased by 25 percent compared to 2021 but remained up to 50 percent 
below the historical 2019 - 2020 levels.xlvi Extending to our other direct 
manufacturing suppliers, we utilize RBA audits to identify health and safety 
code violations, which most often relate to emergency preparedness.

Diversity, Belonging & Inclusion  
     Why It Matters
People are what powers AMD: to transform lives through 
high-performance and adaptive computing, we strive to 
attract, acquire, develop and advance the most engaged, 
diverse and inclusive workforce in the semiconductor industry.

As our industry aspires to expand innovation across emerging and 
fundamental technologies, we recognize the value of diversity among 
the technologists and achievers that will design, deliver or use them 
to solve the world’s most important challenges. This means improving 
representation at AMD and across our industry. In particular, Black and 
Hispanic workers remain under-represented in the science, technology, 
engineering and math (STEM) workforce in the United States.

Women are also signiﬁcantly under-represented in STEM occupations, 
making up a quarter or fewer of the workers in computing and 
engineering.xlvii Issues related to global societal expectations and the 
availability of childcare continue to play an inﬂuential role in the choice 
of educational tracks and career trajectories.xlvix While research shows 
the needle is moving forward, as a society we need to do more to 
support women in the transition to a technology-powered future.
At AMD, we are committed to appropriately growing our population 
of women and other under-represented groups across all levels of the 
organization. With a more diverse and inclusive workforce, we can 
continue to provide exceptional leadership products and strong business 
performance.

     Our Approach

We make AMD stronger by building a diverse talent pipeline, encouraging 
a culture of respect and belonging and increasing the inclusion of under-
represented groups.

We are committed to growing our global team to include as many unique 
voices as possible: our Multi-Voice Initiative encourages and supports all 

AMDers who champion and, when needed, challenge our company 
culture with their unique perspectives. 

With this foundation of diversity, we foster an inclusive workplace 
where innovation thrives. We elevate our talent and improve business 
outcomes by encouraging employees to bring their whole selves to work, 
unleashing the full potential of each employee. This in turn creates a 
sense of community and purpose – what we at AMD call Belonging.

Our DB&I approach includes:

            Listening to our employees through our annual AMDer Survey 
            and curated groups

            Deepening our relationships in the United States with 
            Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and 
            Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs)

            Working to reduce unconscious bias in the workplace 
            by educating our global workforce on the power of multiple 
            voices in driving innovation

            Evaluating employee compensation programs annually 
            so that colleagues performing similar work in the same 
            geographic area and at the same level have equitable 
            compensation opportunities

            Embedding DB&I into our existing talent strategies

            Fostering an environment where every AMDer around the 
            globe has the opportunity to amplify their unique voice to 
            contribute to our company’s success

            Developing and strengthening our employee resource groups 
            (ERGs) by increasing the capabilities of ERG leaders and 
            expanding ERG impact globally

Our approach is working. In our annual AMDer Survey, we ask multiple 
questions on how our culture and processes support our commitment to 
DB&I. Our AMDer Survey scores have increased steadily and signiﬁcantly 
over the past several years, and in 2022, we saw our highest scores to 
date (see page 54). Results for every survey dimension and index listed 
scored at or above external benchmarks for high-performing companies 
within the tech industry.

While we do not rely on external recognition to continue our work toward 
a more diverse and inclusive company and industry, honors and awards 
reﬂect our commitment and show the dedication of our people. In 2022, 
we were recognized by the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the ﬁfth 
consecutive year. Inclusion in the Bloomberg GEI demonstrates our 
commitment toward equal representation of gender at all levels of the 
company and a commitment to equality goals. We are proud that Proﬁles 
in Diversity Journal recognized our diverse AMD talent in the Women

About Our Reporting

     Our Goal and Progress

70 percent of our employees to participate in AMD 
employee resource groups and/or other AMD inclusion 
initiatives by 2025.

In 2022, 51 percent of AMD employees contributed to activities under this 
goal through participation in ERG membership, employee volunteerism and 
charitable donations.vi This slight decrease from 52 percent in 2021 is due 
to the large number of new employees joining the company from our 
acquisitions; we plan to address this by engaging them within the regions 
and business units where we currently see lower engagement. For example, 
in 2023, we are launching an internal campaign supporting these employees 
so they can become part of the AMD ERG community. 

Diversity is integral to our business at AMD, and we want to go beyond 
representation to lead the fabless semiconductor industry in inclusion, 
and continue to develop underrepresented talent in engineering roles.
Starting in 2021 and continuing through 2022, we made these efforts a 
component of our company’s strategic metrics and milestones to inform 
our annual incentive plan, which is a compensation element of our Total 
Rewards Program.

Representation of female engineers and other URGs increased considerably 
at AMD over the ﬁve years prior to 2022.l While we did not realize an increase 
in representation in 2022, we continued our practice of attracting new hires 
that are more diverse than our existing employee base. Additionally, our ability 
to engage and retain female engineers is a competitive advantage, and retention 
remains consistently high over the last several years. Engagement and belonging 
scores from our annual AMDer Survey also remain strong for women engineers 
and other URGs.l

Looking forward to 2023 and beyond, we will seek continued improvement 
in the representation of URGs and female engineers through company-wide 
initiatives, such as the Advancing Women in Tech program that we rolled 
out in 2023.   

Superwomen in Semiconductors: Supporting Future Engineers in Our Industry   
The Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA) launched its Women’s Leadership Initiative in 2019 to address the gender gap in 
our industry and promote the advancement of women. The Initiative is led by the GSA Women’s Leadership Council, which 
includes Ruth Cotter, Senior Vice President, Marketing, Communications and Human Resources. They and others share their 
time and experience to inspire and sponsor the next generation of female leaders. The Initiative works with member companies 
to develop and implement programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. These programs include 
mentoring, leadership development, training and other efforts to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for 
women in the industry.
In 2022, the GSA hosted its annual ﬂagship Women in Semiconductor Hardware conference, which AMD co-sponsored. 
The event brought together industry leaders, entrepreneurs, university students and professionals to connect and celebrate 
women. The gathering returned in-person and opened with a keynote from Dr. Lisa Su, AMD Chair and CEO. Ruth Cotter shared 
remarks during lunch and breakout sessions and panel discussions followed, one of which was led by Suzanne Plummer, 
Fellow and Corporate Vice President, HR, Talent and Diversity at AMD.

Ruth spoke to the audience about the importance of being a Mentor, Advocate, Coach (MAC) and highlighted key initiatives 
at AMD that support diversity and belonging. Suzanne continued the conversation around empowering women in the 
conference’s ﬁnal panel. Joined by women from GlobalFoundries, Synopsis and other companies, the discussion shed light 
on their experiences navigating work and life, the employment gap and the challenges of returnship for companies and 
employees. Like the companies represented in the discussion, our goal at AMD is to empower everyone to advance and enable
our programs to help people reimagine their careers.

AMD employees Pei Yao, principal staff engineer, and Bernice Zee, senior member of technical staff, presented their research 
in conference breakout sessions. Caixia Xiang, corporate vice president of Software Development at AMD received the 2022 
Rising Women of Inﬂuence Award.

During the event, Dr. Su awarded a multi-year grant to the GSA Women’s Leadership Initiative to fund programs and 
initiatives that support female engineering students to consider careers in the semiconductor industry. The grant assists 
the Initiative in hosting keynote speakers, panelists, career guidance and other networking events to help students connect 
with leading companies in the semiconductor industry. 

We are grateful to continue advancing the efforts driven by GSA. And we are proud to celebrate the women who have helped 
break the glass ceiling and those who are following in their footsteps.

About Our Reporting

Talent Attraction and Retention 
Intense competition continues for talent in the 
semiconductor industry, with companies vying to attract 
and retain skilled individuals to help them innovate 
and bring the most successful products and services 
to market. AMD aims to be an employer of choice, with 
passionate, innovative, fully engaged employees.

Our voluntary turnover of 9.5 percent for 2022 was equal to 2021 
and remains low compared to semiconductor industry benchmarks. 
Turnover for women at AMD has trended consistently lower than 
for men over the past several years.

See our new hire, turnover, career development and parental leave data

     Recruitment
We recognize the importance of increasing the representation of 
women and other under-represented groups in engineering and 
continue our efforts to recruit diverse talent and foster an inclusive 
and innovative culture, where the best ideas win, regardless of the 
individual’s identity.

The population of university students in our North America internship 
and co-op programs continued to grow in 2022, resulting in the largest 
summer cohort in AMD history. With that opportunity, we were able 
to expand our outreach to female and under-represented talent in 
engineering and in partnerships with the Society of Women Engineers 
and National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) at some of our partner 
universities like MIT, the University of Texas at Austin and the 
University of Toronto. 

Year 2022 reﬂected renewed engagements as the students returned 
to their universities in person and we were able to visit campuses for 
various events. Seeing them face-to-face and engaging in conversations 
with students, professors and staff allowed us to get some direct insight 
on the challenges of navigating through a curriculum during the pandemic.   

However, it was also interesting to see the shift from wanting all 
on-campus events to a preference of hybrid events – with a larger 
majority of them being virtual. This approach provides greater 
opportunity to introduce AMD on campus and discuss available jobs. 
Furthermore, it allows us to explore new ways to drive diversity 
recruitment. We continued to grow our visibility and credibility at 
HBCUs as we partnered with the Howard University NSBE Chapter for 
a Tech Talk and held an AMD Lobby Day at North Carolina A&T.

Our company’s Intern/Co-op Program is robust and intended to provide 
an enjoyable opportunity for learning and development outside of the 
academic setting. We are committed to helping students and graduates 
expand and apply their theoretical knowledge while building on-the-job 
and focused goal-speciﬁc skills. The program also promotes student 
networking while at AMD, peer to peer events, participation in training 
to develop interpersonal skills and interaction with AMD senior leaders.
Immersing the students in the AMD culture can help inform their future 
career decisions and gain a head start in applying for a full-time position.

AMD in Canada: Supporting Diverse 
Students at the Start of a Tech Career 
AMD enables an encouraging environment for under-
represented groups - including through partnership with 
local universities in Canada. For example, in 2022, AMD 
partnered with the University of Toronto to support the 
Women in Science Summit at Hack the Valley, with 
McMaster University to support a Women in Engineering 
Alumni Night and with Toronto Metropolitan University 
for an information session, a masterclass and a Women 
in Engineering Co-op Panel. Additionally, AMD collaborated 
with McMaster University and the National Society of Black 
Engineers. 

AMD takes a 360˚ approach to Canadian student 
development, incorporating social and professional 
development, communications and gaming. Our Intern 
Steering Committee (ISC) is a pivotal part of our 
Intern/Co-op program. By taking part in the ISC, students 
can build new connections, deepen company culture and 
learn the ability to manage professional and social 
commitments in the workplace.

In 2022, the ISC led an AMD Canada Intern Innovation 
Showcase, where co-op students could share their 
innovations to 3,000 of their local colleagues. The ISC held 
the BioMed Talks: a series of seminars from several full-time 
employees at AMD who are experienced in biomedical 
research or the industry. The ISC also organized the Buddy 
System Matching Program, to pair new co-ops with more 
experienced ones, as well as networking and social events 
such as the Intern Jackbox Party, an online series of party 
video games designed for various group sizes.

             promote inclusivity and belonging for all employees, 
             so everyone feels they can bring their whole self to work

             Measurement and insights into talent placement, 
             development and growth

             Year-round coaching and development to support and 
             enhance goal setting and annual performance reviews

             Pay-for-performance management and assessment 
             process which encourages, recognizes and supports 
             high-performing individuals and teams

Throughout the year, our CEO and senior executives hold cross-
functional discussions about our top talent and the leadership and 
technology skills our business requires.

     Living Wage 

AMD is committed to offering or exceeding a living wage to our employees 
that covers the cost of basic needs at the local level. AMD employee base 
pay is benchmarked to the competitive high-tech market of companies our 
size, with our midpoint targets at or above the median of the market.

     Workplace Flexibility 

AMD is committed to providing a ﬂexible and inclusive workplace that 
enables our employees to do their best work. Using local data, regulations, 
job requirements and an employee survey, AMD has enabled a dynamic 
approach to ﬂexible work across many sites. This allows eligible employees 
a choice in their ﬂexible work schedules: onsite (3 or more days/week in 
office), hybrid (1-2 days in office) or remote (working majority from home). 
We believe that our commitment to workplace ﬂexibility not only makes 
our company a great place to work, but also helps us attract and retain top 
talent from around the world.

AMD in India: Supporting Career 
Development for Women 
In 2022, the AMD Women’s Forum (AWF) in India led 
a virtual panel event to celebrate International Women’s 
Day. The panel featured women at AMD India, who spoke 
about holistic career development support for women. 
Jaya Jagadish, senior vice president, silicon design 
engineering and country head India, opened the event. 
Speakers included Aparna Mandke, Anupama Rasale and 
Sunita Jain, who are AMD principal members of technical 
staff (PMTS). They were joined by Padmini Gopalakrishnan, 
senior director, and Shailaja Cheruvu, manager.

The discussion centered around “building up women 
around you,” and the panelists shared their thoughts on 
meaningful ways of accomplishing this objective while 
avoiding potential pitfalls. They also talked about the 
importance of mentoring, career mantras and access to 
networking.

Another virtual panel discussion organized by AWF India 
aimed to support women’s health. The Women's Health 
and Future session was proposed and enabled by our 
Human Resources team in conjunction with Mercer Marsh – 
the health beneﬁts provider for AMD in India. During the 
event, a panel of doctors specializing in women's health 
covered topics including nutrition for women and hormonal 
imbalance.

About Our Reporting

     Employee Education and Training  

We promote an environment of continuous learning at AMD. Employee 
education and training are provided in different forms and vary by 
country. In some countries, we offer tuition assistance programs and 
other learning programs, such as Leadership Training, Skillsoft Learning, 
TED Talks and Microsoft curriculum.

In 2022, we launched New Employee Orientation Workshops: rolling 
monthly workshops that target speciﬁc topics and allows new hires to 
learn in-depth information about subject areas that are important to 
starting their career at AMD (performance management, career 
development, stock plans, IT and cybersecurity and DB&I). 

AMD Leadership Essentials is a learning experience designed to help 
newer people managers (with less than one year of management 
experience at AMD) build their leadership capability and provide the 
core skills necessary for them to be successful at AMD. The training has 
been offered virtually to accommodate our workforce, which includes 
onsite and remote employees. In 2022, we offered 28 classes, and 778 
new people managers attended these classes to enhance their 
onboarding experience into people management practices at AMD.

The global Learning and Development and Sales Enablement teams 
offered over 177,800 hours of training education to employees in 2022, 
including both virtual and onsite instructor-led trainings on the topics 
requested by our employees most frequently. Our education portfolio 
covers interpersonal skills development for executives, people managers, 
technical leaders, sales leaders and individual contributors. Courses 
include topics such as communication and presentation skills, career 
advancement, leading effective meetings and prioritization, delegation, 
compliance, sales product training and sales enablement.

In 2022, we brought back our Top Talent Programs with onsite delivery 
after a pause during the pandemic. We delivered three Manager 
Leadership Experience programs with a total of 122 participants and 
three Technical Staff Experience programs with a total of 119 participants.

Our Unconscious Bias training was created by AMDers with a focus on how
bias may show up at AMD. In this training, participants learn to interrupt 
the unconscious beliefs that may negatively affect processes, decisions and 
interactions and create a workplace where AMDers feel they can belong and 
contribute to the success of the organization. We also created Lowering the 
Waterline, an internal podcast featuring authentic conversations about 
diversity, belonging and inclusion.

Additionally, AMD e-learning resources include huge, constantly growing 
libraries of courses from Udemy, Skillsoft Percipio and LinkedIn Learning, 
as well as book summaries from getAbstract and thousands of articles 
from Harvard Business Review.

     Employee Performance Management

Under our pay-for-performance philosophy and guiding principles, we reward 
not only team members who demonstrate the highest level of contribution 
to the company, but also those who continually improve their capabilities. 
This helps ensure that rewards are differentiated based on the impact the 
employee’s performance has on the company, as well as how they execute 
their tasks.

Employees are actively engaged in the performance management process. 
In 2022, 100 percent of eligible AMD employees received a formal performance 
rating or regular feedback throughout the year.li

Employee Engagement 
We know that AMDers do their best when they are fully 
engaged and can be themselves at work. In our video 
series, I Am AMD and Career Engineered, AMD employees 
share their stories and unique voices. We released new 
videos throughout 2022 to highlight our inclusive 
workplace environment.

Our employee resource groups (ERGs) encourage employee 
engagement and are an important part of our company’s culture. 
While we had affinity groups for years – most notably the AMD 
Women’s Forum (AWF) – we introduced a corporate ERG policy 
in 2016 to clarify the process and encourage the formation of other 
groups. ERGs create a space for employees who share a common 
identity, along with their allies, to meet and support one another 
in building their community and sense of belonging in the workplace. 
At the same time, our ERGs empower employees by giving each 
group a collective voice to work with senior leadership and increase 
understanding of their community.

With the acquisition of Xilinx in 2022, we added two new ERGs – 
Incredible India and Multicultural – bringing the total to 13. Although 
Pensando did not bring new ERGs into AMD upon acquisition, former 
Pensando employees have been invited to participate in all of our ERGs. 
By combining our voices and sharing ideas and best practices, we have 
ampliﬁed efforts to build a stronger culture; ERG events helped bring 
further inclusion to the combined company. We recognize and capture 
cultural differences in the way we do events, how we communicate 
and the way we are structured.

Our AMDer Survey scores have increased steadily and signiﬁcantly over 
the past several years. In 2022, we saw our highest scores to date. 
Results for every survey dimension and index listed here scored above 
external benchmarks for high-performing companies within the tech 
industry. While we are pleased with these results, we strive for continuous 
improvement in all areas of the AMD employee experience by respecting 
and leveraging our employees’ voices.

Many of our historical investments, programs and policies put in place 
to improve employee engagement and operational excellence originated 
from feedback received through our employee surveys. In 2022, this 
included improvements to our Recharge Days program to include three 
additional global paid days off, the addition of a ﬂoating holiday in the 
U.S., continued ﬂexibility in work location and signiﬁcant investments 
in engineering infrastructure, to name a few.

See our annual AMDer survey data

Workforce Health and Safety  
For more than a decade, our Global Environmental, Health 
and Safety (EHS) Standards have established excellence 
as the benchmark for AMD sites around the world. We
require all our facilities to meet applicable local, regional 
and national regulations. In addition, we set and apply 
standards that go beyond this: we establish premier 
practices based on an assessment of risks and hazards 
across all aspects of the organization to protect employee 
health and safety. In general, these EHS Standards are 
designed to be consistent with internationally recognized 
management systems such as ISO 14001 (Environmental) 
and ISO 45001 (Health and Safety). 

Health and safety-related areas addressed under our Global EHS 
Standards include operational controls to mitigate risks – for example, 
injury and illness prevention through personal protective equipment 
and ergonomics, emergency preparedness and response and electrical, 
equipment and chemical safety training; and monitoring controls – for 
example, equipment and area inspections, audits and corrective action 
review and closure. As a result of acquiring Xilinx in 2022, two of our 
new sites in San Jose, California and Singapore are certiﬁed to the 
ISO 45001 standard. 

Our company's workforce injury and illness case rate  remains below 
the industry average, although this number increased slightly in 2021 
and 2022, largely due to COVID-19-related illnesses. With zero fatalities, 
no high-consequence work-related injuries or illnesses and 12 total cases 
in 2022, including pandemic-related illnesses, sprains and strains, our 
worldwide case ratelii for the year was 0.04 per 200,000 work hours. 
This is signiﬁcantly lower than comparable industry case rates reported 
by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. We also track health and safety 
metrics for our wafer foundry suppliers, with the aim of improving safety 
performance year over year.

Several measures have helped our case rates remain low. Throughout 
the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 through 2022, AMD utilized a global 
health team of registered nurses who managed contact tracing efforts 
to provide personal assistance to employees and helped reduce the 
potential for workplace transmission. To address potential ergonomic 
issues encountered by employees working from home, we provided 
additional training, virtual ergonomic assessments and an equipment 
allowance to help mitigate risks; these programs continue in 2023.

In addition, AMD consistently communicates requirements and best 
practices. Our Global Health, Safety, Security and Physical Security 
(HSSE) Employee Handbook and Global HSSE Contractor Handbook 
outline requirements that are relevant to employees and contractors, 
respectively. These include information on preventing and reporting 
injury and illness and near misses. We require all employees to take 
an ergonomic training course as well as an HSSE Orientation course 
that provides an overview of health and safety requirements. Speciﬁc 
training is also assigned based on job duties to help prevent illness 
and injuries.

AMD Day of Service: Employees Provide 
Over 350,000 Meals to Fight Hunger
In addition to year-round volunteering, AMD hosts an annual AMD Day 
of Service as a company-wide celebration of community volunteerism. During 
our 7th Annual AMD Day of Service in 2022, AMD invested in a signiﬁcant 
effort to ﬁght hunger locally and globally.

Partnering with the nonproﬁt organization Rise Against Hunger, 11 AMD sites 
in India, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Singapore and the United States hosted meal 
packing events to empower and nourish communities and respond to severe 
emergencies and disasters. More than 1,100 volunteers spent 2,175 hours 
shoulder to shoulder assembling nutritious food for distribution to areas 
in desperate need of a safety net. 

    It was great to see our team coming together in the ﬁght against hunger. 
    It is inspiring to know we played a small part in solving a global humanitarian 
    crisis and that a simple meal, which we often take for granted, will make such 
    a big impact on someone else's life. I am glad AMD encourages employees to 
    give back with our time and resources throughout the year.

    Anna Carzana
    Senior Manager Corporate Communications, AMD in Milan

Additionally, multiple sites in Canada, the United States and Singapore hosted 
local food drives and worked in food banks to support families in their own 
communities struggling with food insecurity.

Collectively, during this seventh annual event, AMD employees helped fulﬁll 
a variety of our nonproﬁt partners’ needs through 70 different events across 
25 AMD sites worldwide. In total, more than 3,500 people donated nearly 8,650 
hours of volunteer time for Day of Service in 2022.  

    Giving back to our communities and creating a sustainable future for others 
    are vital. That's not only my personal belief, but also part of the AMD culture.

About Our Reporting

AMD Community Volunteering  
Around the globe, AMD volunteers are easily recognized 
by the bright green volunteer t-shirts they wear. These 
shirts have become a symbol of our culture of generous 
and committed colleagues ready to give their time and 
talent. AMD nurtures this culture through company-
sponsored volunteering and provides opportunities for 
teams to connect while giving back. 

In 2022, nearly 5,000 AMDers logged more than 17,000 hours of 
volunteer time through individual and team-based activities, such 
as planting trees, cleaning parks, assembling STEM education kits, 
building tiny homes for veterans and providing meals for families
experiencing food insecurity. 

Volunteering Highlights
     Preserving the Environment 
Austin – The Global Operations and Quality Team spent the day at 
a nature preserve ﬁxing and mitigating erosion issues by ﬁlling trail 
ravines with mulch, rocks and brush, building check dams and removing 
invasive trees that threaten the preserve’s biodiversity.

Markham – Volunteers helped the nonproﬁt 10,000 Trees for the Rouge 
plant more than 6,000 native trees and shrubs during their annual spring 
planting event and organized two additional park cleanups in the community.

Munich – For the site’s ﬁrst community service initiative, volunteers 
took to the streets around the Dornach office and spent two hours 
collecting trash. 

Global – For Earth Day 2022, AMD partnered with the nonproﬁt agency
Neighborhood Forest to distribute 2,000 trees across North America
through a US$10,000 charitable grant. In conjunction with the AMD 
Go Green ERG, AMDers across nine sites signed up to plant nearly 
500 trees, and the company donated another 1,500 trees to be gifted 
to children through the agency’s annual distribution. 

     Providing for Neighbors in Need

     Promoting Education/STEM Education

Austin – Members of the AMD Women’s Forum employee resource 
group (ERG) hosted a dinner for families moving from homelessness 
toward a future of ﬁnancial independence and security. Saint Louise 
House provides housing and wraparound services for single mothers 
who have experienced homelessness and gives them a pathway to 
success. Each week, Saint Louise House brings the community together 
for dinner and programming for about 45 mothers and children.

Warsaw – AMD volunteers from across Poland spent a day painting 
and redecorating a local orphanage. Through their work, our team 
brightened up the home and made it more comfortable for the children 
living there.

Global – AMDers held in-kind donation drives at sites in Dublin, 
Shanghai, Penang, Fort Collins, Sao Paulo and Mexico City. They 
generously donated over 200 pounds of pantry items and frozen turkeys, 
warm coats and blankets for those experiencing homelessness and 
hundreds of holiday gifts for children, refugee families, elderly people 
and patients in the hospital.

Austin – AMD provided new laptops to outﬁt a learning center for one 
of Foundation Communities’ affordable housing communities. The 
technology enabled students from low-income families to fully engage 
in digital educational learning opportunities in a safe after-school setting, 
helping them in critical areas such as math and reading. The AMD 
Women's Forum ERG also shared the joy of STEM learning by participating 
in the University of Texas at Austin Women in STEM's Virtual Girl Day as 
part of Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day. At this annual event, which 
celebrated its 20th year in 2022, AMD volunteers hosted fun activities 
throughout the day. For example, women AMD engineers joined K-12 
students in a Meet a STEM Role Model room, where they had a chance 
to share their career journeys and answer questions from eager learners.

Dublin – Volunteers from the Dublin office returned to the classroom 
throughout the year with Digital Futures. They presented to hundreds 
of transition year students ages 15-18, to raise their awareness of the 
diverse nature of career opportunities in the technology sector and 
promote STEM careers throughout Ireland.

About Our Reporting

Longmont – 12 AMD interns and several other company volunteers 
facilitated a bootcamp for our company’s open-source project called 
PYNQ. The initiative aims to introduce embedded systems design 
to middle and high school students at the St. Vrain Valley School 
District's Innovation Center in Colorado. Summer interns organized 
the weeklong bootcamp, introduced students to the PYNQ framework, 
created the curriculum and taught the material. They also facilitated 
a hackathon and helped student teams create technology innovations 
designed around smart and sustainable farming using PYNQ-Z2 boards.

Silicon Valley – For 11 years, AMD has supported Project Lead the 
Way Engineering classes across three high schools and two middle 
schools in the San Jose area. These courses encourage students to adopt 
a problem-solving mindset with hands-on experience and pursue STEM 
pathways in higher education. AMD also hosted 20 middle school 
students for a Career Networking Day with Breakthrough Silicon Valley. 
With a focus on helping ﬁrst-generation students on their path to college, 
AMD employees interacted with the students throughout the day in 
various activities. Students learned about different STEM career paths 
from an employee panel, built their ﬁrst computer and toured the AMD 
Technology Showroom with hands-on demonstrations.

Singapore – AMDers at the Singapore Changi site returned to 
Changkat Changi Secondary School to facilitate a coding workshop 
over two days for a group of 14-year-old students. As part of a 
blended learning curriculum, the group of 15 students heard from 
AMD employees about STEM careers and gained hands-on experience 
with micro:bit and the HuskyLens AI camera. Volunteers also visited 
the Chen Su Lan Children’s home and conducted workshops on 
programming in Scratch, digital art, robotics and 3-D printing to 
inspire students to pursue STEM education. The students were able 
to develop their skills and learn about future careers in tech.

AMD and the AMD Foundation 
Charitable Giving  
In addition to volunteering time, AMD and our employees 
fulﬁll our global commitment as good, responsible neighbors 
through charitable giving – both monetary and in-kind 
contributions. AMD and the AMD Foundation provide grants 
to nonproﬁt organizations based on recommendations from 
employee-led community affairs councils, local needs and 
strategic ﬁt.

In 2022, employees took advantage of a newly launched, year-round 
AMD Matching Gift and Volunteer Reward Program. According to the 
program’s guidelines, we are proud to annually match 1:1 up to US$1,500 
per employee and US$500 per co-op/intern to eligible organizations 
worldwide.

AMD also offered special 2:1 matching gift programs above and beyond 
the annual program in response to Ukraine humanitarian efforts and 
Hurricane Ian disaster relief efforts. AMD and AMD employees donated 
over US$530,000 through a special employee matching program and 
corporate donations to support humanitarian aid and refugee relief.liii

Additionally, AMD donated to the American Red Cross, Community 
Foundation of Ireland Ukraine Fund and Second Harvest Food Bank 
of Central Florida for continued relief efforts.

In 2022, the combined philanthropic efforts of AMD, our employees and 
the AMD Foundation, including investments made through the AMD 
HPC Fund and institutional research grants resulted in US$11.6 million 
for nonproﬁt organizations, universities and research institutes.

AMD donated to dozens of nonproﬁt organizations around the world 
in 2022 to advance our strategic purposes in quality education with 
an emphasis in STEM, environmental sustainability, basic needs and 
social services and humanitarian relief, including:

Regional Spotlights

AMD in Greater China: Reading and Running 
to Advance Community Involvement 
The AMD spirit of giving back in the communities where 
we live and work is evident throughout Greater China with 
numerous volunteering events held in 2022. For example, 
the AMD Shanghai Let's Read Books Together initiative
encouraged employees to read books for self-growth and 
share their enthusiasm for reading with schools in remote 
mountainous areas. More than 700 Shanghai Research 
and Development Center employees participated, reading 
books and sharing their insights in the form of book 
reviews to help the schools. 

Many of our volunteers were impacted in 2022 when a 
typhoon hit Hong Kong on the day they were taking part 
in a food packing event. AMD in Hong Kong partnered with 
Food Angel, a food rescue and assistance program launched 
by Bo Charity Foundation with a mission to distribute food 
to those experiencing food insecurity. Despite the typhoon, 
the enthusiastic volunteers still arrived at the site early, 
where they broke into production lines to ﬁll meal boxes. 
Together, they packed 1,273 meals in one hour, helping 
people experiencing homelessness, unemployment and 
food insecurity with high-quality meals they could enjoy. 

Teamwork was evident in September 2022, at the Energy 
& Charity Run in Beijing – an event that helped bring 
together long-time AMDers as well as new ones following 
the acquisition of Xilinx. Nearly 50 AMD employees were 
among 200 runners at the event, organized by the U.S. 
China Energy Cooperation Program and the Beijing 
Marathon Association and held at Marathon Camp  

at the Beijing Winter Olympic Park. AMD was one of over  
40 well-known companies represented. With RMB 30,000 
raised in donations, the event was a success – and several 
AMDers had personal successes too, sweeping wins at two 
of the three championship races.

AMD in India: Collaborating Locally to 
Support Women and Girls on a Path 
to Employment
In 2022, as part of our aspiration to secure sustainable 
livelihood opportunities for women in India from 
disadvantaged communities, we extended our community 
programs that aim to help women and girls through education. 

The lack of required skills creates a major challenge to 
employment of some women in India today. To address this, 
AMD funds the Skill Bharath program run by CHORD India, 
which provides skill training for employability for 
underprivileged and vulnerable women in Hyderabad. With 
the support of AMD, more than 1,200 women aged 18 to 35 
have already taken part in the training toward independence. 

In 2022, we renewed our support in a project that aimed to 
empower 160 women with training in tailoring and textile 
design. All 160 women enrolled in the Skill Bharath program 
completed the course. The training aimed to build their 
conﬁdence and make them more competitive in the 
employment market. Following the program, the participants 
either secured decent work or started home-based enterprises 
with the aim of achieving ﬁnancial independence.

Our community efforts are also focused on helping younger 
women and girls for the country’s future workforce. 

This includes supporting girls in their education through our 
long-term partnership with Udayan Care Foundation. The 
Udayan Shalini Fellowship Program aims to beneﬁt girls from 
lower-income backgrounds with educational and ﬁnancial 
support and experimental learning. The girls receive individual 
mentoring from our workforce and their families are invited 
to take part in counseling. The program also helps the girls 
broaden their horizons and encourage them to become socially 
responsible citizens. Operating from October 2022 to March 
2023, AMD supported 15 girls and their families, helping them 
improve life skills and understand the importance of learning.

AMD in Singapore: Uniting to Build Culture 
and Support Communities 
The AMD Community Service Committee paint project returned 
in November 2022 after a two-year break, and we were ready 
to roll up our sleeves. Working in partnership with Thye Hua 
Kwan Moral Charities’ Indus Moral Care Seniors Activity Centre, 
nearly 60 AMD Singapore volunteers gave 13 apartments a 
makeover, helping people in need feel more at home. We 
painted, plastered and cleaned, learning new skills along the 
way – and some company departments used the opportunity 
as a team building event, making it doubly meaningful.

Many of our employees choose to use the company’s Matching 
Gift and Volunteer Reward Program to amplify their personal 
donations with a 1:1 match by AMD to eligible nonproﬁt 
organizations. During the year, we organized a donation drive 
to raise money for a variety of nonproﬁt organizations 
nominated by employees, including Boys’ Town and Ahuva 
Good Shepherd Children’s Home. During the drive, AMD and 
our employees contributed a total of S$13,000.

About Our Reporting

Reporting Standards and Scope  

AMD is committed to publicly reporting clear and 
transparent ESG data and sharing our progress, as we 
continue to evolve our internal processes and external 
disclosures to meet stakeholder expectations, as well 
as developing regulatory guidelines and standards.    

     Reporting Standards and Frameworks
The 2022-23 Corporate Responsibility Report has been prepared in 
accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (2021). 
In addition, the report includes climate-related disclosures included 
in the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) as well as relevant disclosures in applicable 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards. AMD also 
annually reports to CDP on climate change and water, as well as reports 
on how AMD is helping advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs).

     Reporting Scope and Boundaries 
Unless otherwise stated, the information and data provided pertain 
to the period January 1 to December 31, 2022. Our reported data reﬂects 
all AMD operations, and it includes data resulting from the acquisitions 
of Xilinx and Pensando.

In accordance with the GHG Protocol, we have incorporated 2020, 2021 
and 2022 operational energy use (electricity and fuels) and related GHG 
emissions (Scope 1 and 2) for the two acquired companies into our 

operational GHG data. This is because AMD had a public GHG 
goal with a base year prior to the acquisitions (2020). We have 
revised our 2020 Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions goal baseline 
to reﬂect the operational boundary of the combined company. 
For water, waste and other environmental metrics for AMD 
operations, we are reporting 2022 data for the combined 
company (including the acquisitions) but not for prior years, 
because AMD did not have related public goals at the time 
of the acquisitions.

     External Assurance 

We received external limited level assurance in accordance with 
the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 
3000 Revised for 2022 data on our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
and related performance against ﬁve of our CR goals, as well as 
Scope 3 GHG emissions for business air travel.

Inquiries related to this report can be made to:

Further details can be found on our CR website.

     External Recognition 

While our commitment to being a responsible corporation does 
not rely on recognition, it is a meaningful validation of our work 
when external organizations rank us alongside the top sustainable 
companies. We are proud to be honored with the  recognitions 
on the right.

Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Standards   
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has developed voluntary industry-speciﬁc 
disclosure standards to enable businesses globally to identify, manage and communicate ﬁnancially-
material sustainability information to their investors. These Standards identify the subset of ESG 
issues most relevant to ﬁnancial performance across various industries.     

We have outlined below how our existing disclosures as of December 31, 2022, align with the recommended metrics 
for the SASB Technology and Communications Sector: Semiconductor Standard.

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures   
The Financial Stability Board created the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to improve 
and increase reporting of climate-related ﬁnancial information. TCFD’s disclosure recommendations are structured 
around four thematic areas that represent core elements of how organizations operate: governance, strategy, risk 
management, and metrics and targets. These thematic areas are intended to interlink and inform each other.      

We have outlined below how our existing disclosures, as of December 31, 2022, align with the recommended TCFD metrics.

TCFD Governance Disclosure

AMD Response

A) Describe the board’s oversight of 
     climate-related risks and opportunities.

The highest level of ESG oversight (including climate-related risks and opportunities) at AMD resides 
with our Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee maintains formal oversight 
of the company’s focus on ESG. The Audit and Finance Committee oversees the company's voluntary 
and required ESG reporting and associated regulatory compliance.

CDP Climate Change Survey Question C1.2a

Our ESG Executive Steering Committee, a cross-functional team comprised of Directors and Vice 
Presidents, is responsible for overseeing progress on our ESG priorities, goals and disclosures while 
communicating regularly with the AET. Climate-related issues are managed by the Corporate 
Responsibility (CR) team, which works closely with Global Operations, Regulatory Affairs, Facilities, 
EHS and product engineers throughout AMD to coordinate initiatives related to product energy efficiency 
(performance per watt), energy use and GHG emissions across the company’s value chain. 

TCFD Strategy Disclosure

AMD Response

A) Describe the climate-related risks and 
     opportunities the organization has identiﬁed 
     over the short, medium and long term.

Our 2023 ESG materiality assessment for corporate responsibilityii identiﬁed current or potential ESG 
impacts on our business and from AMD on the environment and society over the short, medium and long 
term. Examples of identiﬁed climate-related risks and opportunities include advancing product energy 
efficiency, helping customers reduce emissions, reducing energy/emissions impacts in the supply chain 
and sourcing renewable energy. In addition, potential risks to AMD operations, supply chain and products 
have been identiﬁed due to extreme weather events such as ﬂoods, heatwaves and freezes.

About Our Reporting

B) Describe the impact of climate-related risks 
     and opportunities on the organization’s 
     businesses, strategy and ﬁnancial planning.

Our company’s business strategy and planning take into account climate-related risks (i.e., extreme 
weather), opportunities (i.e., customer engagements) and other factors (i.e., regulations). Accelerating 
product energy efficiency, particularly in the data center, continues to be a strategic priority. As a result, 
AMD powers the most energy-efficient x86 servers through its 4th Gen EPYC™ processors, delivering 
exceptional performance and helping lower energy consumption.lxxi

C) Describe the resilience of the organization’s 
     strategy, taking into consideration different 
     climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C 
     or lower scenario.

AMD continues to pursue a science-based GHG emissions reduction goal for our operations (aligned 
with a 1.5˚C scenario) while charting a bold path to advance energy efficiency for accelerated computing 
applications in AI-training and high-performance computing. We also work closely with our direct 
manufacturing suppliers to increase efficient use of resources and renewable energy while we also 
invest in stakeholder engagement to support industry efforts.

TCFD Risk Management Disclosure

AMD Response

A) Describe the organization’s processes for 
     identifying and assessing climate-related risks.

B) Describe the organization’s processes 
     for managing climate-related risks.

We use ESG materiality assessmentsii to prioritize climate and other issues, set our strategy and 
continuously strengthen our engagement with key stakeholders. This approach allows us to 
prioritize where we need to focus our efforts to have the most impact and operationalize our goals 
into the business.

Our ESG Executive Steering Committee is responsible for overseeing progress on our ESG priorities, 
goals and disclosures while communicating regularly with the AET.

C) Describe how processes for identifying, 
     assessing and managing climate-related 
     risks are integrated into the organization’s 
     overall risk management.

The primary assessment of our Company’s risks is made through our enterprise risk management (“ERM”) 
review process and our internal and disclosure controls review processes. Risks identiﬁed through these 
processes are reviewed regularly with our executive leadership and with the Company’s Board of Directors. 
Our ERM processes appropriately integrates elements of ESG and climate which are assessed through 1) 
periodic internal ESG readiness assessments, 2) monthly meetings among internal cross-functional teams, 
3) quarterly emerging risks reports to the Audit and Finance Committee of our company’s Board of 
Directors and relevant company executives, and 4) annual Enterprise Risk Assessment for our company’s 
Board of Directors and relevant company executives.

ii We include certain disclosures, reports and information on various environmental, social and corporate responsibility-related matters on our website (collectively, our “ESG Materials”). Our ESG Materials may contain information that is signiﬁcant; however, any signiﬁcance 
should not be read as necessarily rising to the level of the deﬁnition of materiality used for the purposes of our compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws, even where we use the word “material” or “materiality” in our ESG Materials (including where we use it in connection 
with our materiality assessment) or in other materials issued in connection with the matters discussed in our ESG Materials. We have used deﬁnitions of materiality in the course of creating our ESG Materials and the goals and metrics discussed therein that do not coincide 
with or rise to the level of the deﬁnition of materiality used for the purposes of our compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws. Moreover, given the uncertainties, estimates and assumptions inherent in the matters discussed in our ESG Materials, and the timelines involved, 
materiality is inherently difficult to assess far in advance. In addition, given the inherent uncertainty of the estimates, assumptions and timelines associated with the matters discussed in our ESG Materials, we may not be able to anticipate in advance whether or the degree 
to which we will or will not be able to meet our plans, targets or goals.

iii Reported data includes a) students, faculty or researchers with direct access to AMD-donated technology, funding or volunteers; and b) individuals with a reasonable likelihood of receiving research data formulated through AMD-donated technology and potentially gaining

iv Includes AMD high-performance CPU and GPU accelerators used for AI-training and high-performance computing in a 4-Accelerator, CPU-hosted conﬁguration. Goal calculations are based on performance scores as measured by standard performance metrics (HPC: Linpack 
DGEMM kernel FLOPS with 4k matrix size. AI-training: lower precision training-focused ﬂoating-point math GEMM kernels such as FP16 or BF16 FLOPS operating on 4k matrices) divided by the rated power consumption of a representative accelerated compute node, including 
the CPU host + memory and 4 GPU accelerators.

v EPYC-030a: Calculation includes 1) base case kWhr use projections in 2025 conducted with Koomey Analytics based on available research and data that includes segment speciﬁc projected 2025 deployment volumes and data center power utilization effectiveness (PUE) including 
GPU HPC and machine learning (ML) installations and 2) AMD CPU and GPU node power consumptions incorporating segment-speciﬁc utilization (active vs. idle) percentages and multiplied by PUE to determine actual total energy use for calculation of the performance per Watt. 
13.5x is calculated using the following formula: (base case HPC node kWhr use projection in 2025 * AMD 2023 perf/Watt improvement using DGEMM and TEC +Base case ML node kWhr use projection in 2025 *AMD 2023 perf/Watt improvement using ML math and TEC) /(2020 
perf/Watt * Base case projected kWhr usage in 2025). For more information, www.amd.com/en/corporate-responsibility/data-center-sustainability. 

vi These are voluntary initiatives in which an employee chooses to actively participate in one or more employee engagement programs that foster a culture of belonging, psychological safety and meaningful connection to AMD. Goal calculations are based on internal analysis of ERG 
membership, employee volunteers and charitable donors each year during the goal period.

vii Reported data includes Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (base year 2020). Based on AMD calculations that are third-party veriﬁed (limited level assurance).

About Our Reporting

lxiii AMD estimates scope 1 emissions from refrigerants such as hexaﬂuoroethane (HFE) and hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs), and fuel used such as diesel and natural gas. Emission factors for fuels are based on the GHG Protocol Calculation Tool (Global Warming Potential Values) 
and refrigerants in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report or manufacturers' published information. The scope is based on operational control (i.e., AMD-occupied facilities). We follow the GHG Protocol, the internationally recognized standard for the corporate accounting and 
reporting of GHG emissions. The method includes Site Metrics Coordinators entering monthly values into AMD’s central database where emission factors are applied. Note: A previous version of this data table incorrectly reported fugitive emissions stemming from refrigerant 
releases as Air Emissions: Ozone Depleting Substances. The AMD EHS team is not aware of any production, import or export of Ozone Depleting Substances. Emissions from refrigerant releases are included in our Scope 1 values.

lxiv AMD estimates market-based and location-based scope 2 emissions. AMD Site Metrics Coordinators enter the amount of electricity used each quarter into AMD’s central database. AMD follows the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the internationally recognized standard for the corporate 
accounting and reporting of GHG emissions. Emission factors for locations in the U.S. are based on eGRID total output emission rates, and for outside the U.S. are based on International Energy Agency (IEA) national electricity emission factors. If electricity use data is not available, 
as for small offices, then an average value for U.S. office buildings is used for all AMD locations (16.9 kWh/sq ft) based on EIA CBECS results for the average administrative office, and the emission factor for the location is applied. AMD sources renewable energy through utility 
providers (U.S., Ireland) and third-party certiﬁed renewable energy credits (RECs in the US and Singapore; iRECs in China and India), as well as generates renewable energy onsite in the U.S. Note: In September 2023, AMD updated its previously reported Scope 2 market-based values 
for 2020-2022 to reﬂect residual mix emission factors using Green-e Residual Mix Emissions for USA and other country-speciﬁc residual factors where available, in accordance with the GHG Protocol.

lxv Our goal is a 50 percent reduction in absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from 2020-2030.

lxvi In 2020 and 2021, AMD expanded the estimations for scope 3 reporting. In 2022, we included Xilinx and Pensando in our upstream emission estimates, but not downstream due to lack of available data at the time of our annual reporting. Our value chain emissions are estimated 
following the guidance from the GHG protocol. Category 1: Emissions associated with Foundry, OSAT and other direct manufacturing suppliers are calculated using Scope 1 and 2 emissions collected from top suppliers, allocated to AMD, and extrapolated to account for direct 
manufacturing suppliers that do not disclose their emissions. Emissions upstream of AMD’s Foundry suppliers are then estimated using a manufacturing LCA index speciﬁc to AMD’s highest volume products. Emissions from all other direct vendors (including marketing, professional 
services, real estate, software providers, telecom and networking providers and other manufacturing services) are calculated using a spend-based method. Category 3: Emissions are calculated using fuel and electricity consumption data collected from our sites globally, and emission 
factors from DEFRA and IEA. Category 4: emissions are estimated using a hybrid methodology combining supplier-speciﬁc emissions reported by two of our major shipping providers and a mode-speciﬁc, spend-based calculation on all other logistics spend. Category 5: Data is collected 
from our sites globally and emissions are calculated using DEFRA factors per waste type and waste disposal method. Category 6: Emissions are from air travel only and are provided by our travel agency, in accordance with the GHG Protocol. In 2022 we added private jet travel. 
Category 7: Emissions are based on survey data, internal assumptions, and/or local commuter transit data from our 9 largest campuses and are calculated using a distance-based method for average distance travelled and mode. 2020 and 2021 emissions are adjusted to reﬂect the 
proportion of employees working on-site versus remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Category 11: Emissions are calculated based on total sales volume, average product electricity consumption, and average product lifetime split by product category for all products sold in the 
reporting year. Country-speciﬁc IEA emission factors are used to calculate emissions resulting from product use. A given percentage of server-related products are assumed to be powered with renewable electricity based on data center customer data. Category 12: Emissions are 
calculated based on the average product weight by product category and the total sales volume within the reporting year. A weight-based calculation is used, with the disposal method estimated using region-speciﬁc e-waste recycling, landﬁlling, and incineration benchmarks. 
Emission factors associated with e-waste treatment are obtained from the EPA.

lxvii  Downstream 2022 Scope 3 data does not include Xilinx and Pensando Systems due to a lack of available data. We aim to include the associated GHG emissions in next year’s report.

lxviii Economic data for current and past years are updated annually to reﬂect the company’s most recent ﬁnancial reports.

lxix 2020 increase based in large part on contributions from the AMD COVID-19 High Performance Compute (HPC) Fund. The program details are available at www.amd.com/en/corporate/hpc-fund.

lxx SP5-072:  A 4th Gen EPYC 9654 powered server has highest overall scores in key industry-recognized energy efficiency benchmarks SPECpower_ssj®2008, SPECrate®2017_int_energy_base and SPECrate®2017_fp_energy_base. 
See details at https://www.amd.com/en/claims/epyc4#SP5-072

lxxi AMD acknowledges that while trade associations and collaborative industry groups serve important functions in our industry, they also warrant extra care in complying with the antitrust laws.  It is AMD’s policy that AMD and all of our employees comply strictly with all applicable 
antitrust laws, and avoid conversations or actions that could be viewed as acting in concert with others to restrain trade or competition.  Our participation in any trade associations or industry groups is guided by the following principles, without limitation:  (1) we do not engage in any 
discussions, or reach agreements, with competitors, peers or suppliers with respect to prices or factors that may affect prices such as costs, discounts, terms of sale or proﬁt margins; (2) we do not engage in any discussions, or reach agreements, with competitors, peers or suppliers, 
with respect to strategic plans, including details regarding plans for geographic or product markets, as well as employment and labor-related matters; (3) we protect and do not disclose our competitively sensitive information; (4) we appropriately confer with our antitrust counsel 
before discussing any topic or making any statement that could implicate any of the foregoing principles; and (5) we encourage our employees to immediately advise company counsel if they are approached at a trade association or collaborative industry group by a competitor, peer 
or supplier who suggests anything in violation of these principles.

Our technology touches the lives of billions of people around the world, playing a vital role accelerating scienti c research, exploring deep space, keeping drivers safe on the road and powering businesses.

But it’s not enough to deliver next generation experiences.

At AMD, we are committed to doing so responsibly, with integrity and in a way that fundamentally aligns with our values and inclusive culture.

Our 28th annual report is the rst since Xilinx and Pensando joined AMD to create a larger company with an expanded team and a broader set of products all of which helped us grow annual revenue 44 percent to a record US 23.6 billion in 2022.

Thanks to our customers, partners, suppliers and employees, I am proud to say we also made signi cant progress in 2022 on our focus areas, spanning digital impact, environmental sustainability, supply chain responsibility and diversity, belonging and inclusion.

Our digital impact initiatives, such as the AMD University program, cloud based grants and on site hardware donations, put AMD technology in the hands of those solving pressing challenges in healthcare, climate, education and beyond.

We introduced new products in support of our goal to deliver a 30x increase in energy efficiency by 2025 for AI training and high performance computing applications.

Our focus on energy efficient computing is also gaining momentum, with seven of the world’s top 10 most energy efficient supercomputers powered by AMD ranked on the June 2023 Green500 list.

These achievements re ect our differentiated IP portfolio, strong collaboration across our value chain and expanded partnerships.

As one of the world’s largest fabless semiconductor companies, we work with a carefully chosen network of suppliers to address collective needs throughout the value chain, from human rights risks to environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions and water usage.

In 2022, we made progress toward our goals for supplier capacity building and audits.

And we again received the CDP Supplier Engagement Leadership recognition for addressing climate risks in the supply chain, which is reserved for the top 8% of reporting companies.

I am excited to report that 92% of our employees say they are proud to work for AMD.

We remain committed to pursuing diversity, belonging and inclusion in our workforce, given its tangible value to innovation and company performance in 2022 we were recognized as a member of the 2022 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the fourth consecutive year.

To amplify the good work of our employees around the world, in 2022 we also launched a year round employee matching program, which contributed to the total US 11.6 million in cash and technology that AMD, AMD Foundation and our employees donated to nonpro t organizations, universities and research institutes.

You can read more about our progress and priorities throughout this report.

While we have accomplished so much in recent years, I am even more excited about what AMD, together with our partners, can accomplish moving forward.

Our approach to corporate responsibility has remained fundamentally consistent for almost three decades: we listen to our stakeholders and embrace the business value of corporate responsibility across our products, operations, supply chain and engagement.

But what has changed over the past year is our extended reach through programs, measured progress and disclosure following the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando.

To inform our priorities, we updated our ESG materiality assessment and conducted a human rights saliency assessment.

A key aspect of the companies’ integration was incorporating them into our internal corporate responsibility (CR) governance our Executive ESG Steering Committee, Executive Team and Board helping fully embed CR across the broader company.

We also increased our collaboration on related issues, with more employee brie ngs, customer dialogues and supplier engagements on climate, labor and human rights.

AMD shares many of the same challenges facing our industry, including the increasing urgency of the climate crisis.

We are driving meaningful change with a science based target for our operations and increased accountability: we have received external limited assurance on Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (including historical Xilinx data for 2020 and 2021), Scope 3 business travel and ve of our ESG goals.

We continue to deliver market leading products to help our customers to advance their sustainability goals, too.

As of mid 2023, we are on track toward achieving a 13.5x improvement in energy efficiency for AMD processors and accelerators powering servers for AI training and high performance computing, compared to the 2020 baseline.

We were honored to receive a 2022 SEAL Sustainable Product Award for innovative and impactful products purpose built’ for a sustainable future in data centers.

In the larger ecosystem, we continue to work with customers, suppliers and peers to address the signi cant sources of GHG emissions.

This includes my service as vice chair of the Responsible Business Alliance Board of Directors, with its focus and programs to advance responsibility in supply chains worldwide.

AMD values our site communities worldwide, and in 2022 we saw a return to in person volunteer engagement.

In a remarkable effort to ght hunger, during our annual day of community service, AMDers packed 350,000 meals for people globally facing food insecurity.

We also continued to support local communities nancially, investing US 10 million through the CNote platform to increase economic mobility and nancial inclusion in underserved U.S. communities.

I invite you to learn more about these and other initiatives in this report, which is aligned with the GRI Standards, SASB Standards and TCFD recommendations.

In closing, I thank my AMD colleagues for their drive to deliver exceptional semiconductor technologies while pursuing sustainable development for a better future in our world.

We look at CR through the lens of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, which enables us to focus our efforts, operationalize our goals into the business and make the most impact.

It also helps us focus our reporting and transparency efforts on the issues that have the largest impact on our business and society.

We continuously monitor and address a broad range of topics.

We also conduct periodic evaluations to better understand the overall landscape, set priorities and evolve our practices, policies and programs.

In 2023, we engaged with BSR, a global sustainable business network and consultancy, to complete an impact based ESG materiality assessmentii.

This assessment took into account the evolution of our business (including our acquisitions in 2022), evolving investor and other stakeholder ESG information needs and the continuing evolution of reporting expectations informed by organizations such as the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.

The resulting ESG materiality matrix re ects our most material issues based on their potential impact on the business and the potential impact the business has on society and the environment.

As a result, the assessment adopts a double materiality’ approach.

Although this assessment has resulted in some changes to the placement of topics within our matrix compared to previous assessments, the issues themselves remain fairly consistent.

The main exception is the emergence of responsible AI and product use as a top tier material issue based on the double materiality approach used for the purposes of this assessment.

The results of the materiality assessment reaffirm our company’s CR strategic focus areas (on page 8) while providing valuable insight into new facets that need to inform our business strategy and operations moving forward.

We also consider several of the issues noted in the matrix as part of our foundational approach to conducting business responsibly.

These issues include responsible sourcing, corporate governance, ethical conduct, product security, data privacy, business continuity planning and supply chain resilience.

Our Goals and Progress Digital Impact We design products that help improve people’s lives through high performance and adaptive computing solutions spanning healthcare, education, manufacturing, scienti c research and other critical needs.

Goal 100 million people to bene t from AMD and AMD Foundation philanthropy and partnerships that enable STEM education, scienti c research and the workforce of the future by 2025 (base year 2020).

Environmental Sustainability We are steadfast in our commitment to sustainability by sourcing renewable energy, engaging our employees and suppliers on environmental initiatives and helping end users reduce energy use and emissions.

As of mid 2023, we are on track toward achieving a 13.5x improvement.

Diversity, Belonging and Inclusion We encourage and support creative minds from diverse backgrounds to work together in an engaging and open environment.

Goal 70% of our employees to participate in AMD employee resource groups and or other AMD inclusion initiatives by 2025.

Supply Chain Responsibility We work with our suppliers to deliver high quality products, while helping ensure that working conditions are safe, workers are treated with respect and manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible.

Goals 100% of AMD direct manufacturing supplier factories to have a Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) audit or equivalent by 2025.

How We Are Integrating Xilinx and Pensando, Recent Acquisitions, into Our CR Priorities and Programs In 2022, AMD closed two major acquisitions, Xilinx and Pensando Systems, advancing our company’s continued opportunities for technology and product leadership, market diversi cation and expanded customer partnerships.

We have been investing and working diligently since the close of the acquisitions to support effective integration for our shareholders, customers and employees, ensuring our view of AMD remains clear through the ESG lens.

To advance research in areas related to the world’s biggest challenges, AMD integrated the Xilinx Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Clusters (HACC) with the AMD HPC Fund, providing researchers with access to AMD EPYC processors, AMD Instinct accelerators, Xilinx Alveo accelerators and Xilinx Versal ACAPs.

Their efforts are addressing issues in climate change, healthcare, transportation and big data.

In addition, we have consolidated our academic initiatives into the AMD University Program, including collaboration with universities and research organizations, research grants and hardware donations.

To re ect the current business, AMD reset the 2020 baseline for our 2020 2030 operational GHG goal (Scope 1 and 2).

AMD obtained third party, limited level assurance of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions of Xilinx operations for 2020 and 2021 (prior to the acquisition), and for the combined company in 2022.

With regard to Scope 3 GHG emissions, Xilinx and Pensando did not have Scope 3 inventories (covering areas like the supply chain and product use) upon acquisition.

Upstream GHG emissions related to the acquisitions, including supply chain, are included in our 2022 Scope 3 estimates.

In the second half of 2023 we will continue our work to estimate related downstream GHG emissions, including product use.

Our Diversity, Belonging and Inclusion (DB I) program and initiatives apply globally, and in 2022, we focused on integrating our new employees and expanding our DB I efforts across our larger company.

For example, employee resource group (ERG) leaders from AMD and Xilinx aligned on our DB I philosophy and highlighted the integral role of ERGs in our company’s purpose and priorities.

We also added two new ERGs Incredible India and Multicultural bringing the total to 13.

By sharing ideas and best practices we ampli ed our collective efforts, helping build a stronger culture.

AMD is committed to responsible business throughout our supply chain, which has grown with our acquisitions.

In 2022, we shared the AMD Supply Chain Responsibility Guide with new direct manufacturing suppliers and began to monitor their conformance to the requirements set out in the AMD Code of Conduct and Supply Chain Responsibility Guide.

We celebrated our rst AMD Day of Service as a combined company an initiative for employees to join one another in volunteering to bene t our communities while meeting one another in enjoyable, meaningful activities.

In addition to a number of events held across our sites globally, AMD partnered with the nonpro t organization Rise Against Hunger to host meal packing events at 11 sites to empower and nourish communities and respond to severe emergencies and disasters.

CR Management and Governance At AMD, we are committed to doing the right thing and conducting our business ethically.

Our approach to CR management and governance applies to all aspects of our business, spanning product design, supply chain, AMD operations and external engagement.

Embedding CR across the business in this way requires commitment and accountability throughout AMD, from our leaders who set the strategy to those working hands on to improve our performance.

We pursue this through executive leadership and effective cross functional team coordination.

Along with actionable stakeholder engagement, this enables us to set clear objectives, track progress and promote accountability through transparent disclosure.

The AMD Board of Directors The highest level of ESG oversight (including risks and opportunities) at AMD resides with our Board.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee maintains formal oversight of the company’s focus on ESG.

AMD takes a multi faceted approach to CR related risk management.

For example, a cross functional team focused on product energy efficiency meets bi monthly to discuss regulatory and standards developments that may pose short, medium or longer term risks or opportunities.

The team is led by our Corporate Vice President of International Government Affairs and Corporate Responsibility, with the participation of product engineers and business teams.

Business continuity planning is another area of risk management that brings together Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS), Finance, Human Resources, Global Operations, Information Technology and other teams to identify and plan for events that could disrupt AMD or supplier operations.

While we cannot guarantee our suppliers compliance with our corporate responsibility priorities, we conduct facility level due diligence of our direct manufacturing suppliers to help address risk factors related tohuman rights (e.g.

For our non manufacturing (indirect) suppliers, we annually conduct a risk assessment based on geography, sector and spend to identify the highest risk suppliers for additional due diligence steps such as self assessment questionnaires and other direct engagements.

We also contribute to industry efforts to advance sub tier supplier mapping to identify and address risks further into the supply chain.

To manage EHS risk within our own operations, we apply our Global EHS Standards, which include periodic risk assessments of operational EHS risks at the site and corporate level.

We complete these at least annually, but an assessment may also be triggered when there is a signi cant change in operations.

We evaluate risks to the EHS controls in place, and we use the results, as well as compliance audits and internal inspections, to identify focus areas and corrective actions and continually improve our programs.

Our Value Chain Leading companies create opportunities to accelerate meaningful action.

They do this by deepening their understanding of social and environmental issues and expanding their view of their responsibilities in these areas.

They look beyond their own operations and work closely with value chain partners and other key stakeholders.

At AMD, we are pushing the boundaries of what we can do by embedding corporate responsibility (CR) across our value chain.

Our approach extends from how our products are designed, manufactured and assembled to how they are packaged, shipped and used.

Embedding CR Across our Value Chain Our impacts vary throughout the value chain.

To put our action in context, we have mapped our CR programs and initiatives to the primary activities of our value chain.

AMD engineers design the circuitry for our broad portfolio of products, which includes CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, FPGAs, SoCs and APUs. Our employees work at more than 90 locations worldwide.

Our foundry partners manufacture AMD designs on a silicon wafer.

Typical wafers originate from a cylindrical ingot of high purity monocrystalline silicon, which are sliced into 300mm diameter circular wafers of about 0.775 mm thickness.

Each wafer undergoes multiple multiple steps in the wafer fabrication process to produce an AMD designed processor or die.

The working die is cut from the silicon wafer and sent to be assembled into a chip.

In the assembly process, each die is attached to a small interconnection board called a substrate so it can function with other devices on a larger circuit board.

The die on substrate combination is then further assembled into a protective package to dissipate heat and protect it from other elements.

Once fully assembled, each chip is tested for functionality.

Quali ed chips are packaged for shipping to our customers.

AMD CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and Adaptive SoCs are sold in diverse ways.

For CPUs and GPUs, AMD works with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) that integrate our technology into their branded devices hyperscale and cloud data center providers that integrate our technology into their custom built servers channel partners that sell standard and customized solutions and retailers that sell processors in a box direct to the computer enthusiast community.

For FPGAs and adaptive SoCs, AMD sells these devices and board level products primarily through channel partners and to direct customers.

AMD technology powers billions of intelligent devices made by our customers, including PCs, game consoles, servers and industrial devices.

Following acquisitions in 2022, AMD is powering even more automotive and telecommunications applications.

These products are de ning the new era of high performance and adaptive computing.

AMD solutions enable people everywhere to realize the full potential of their favorite devices and applications and push the boundaries of what is possible.

The world’s creators, researchers, inventors and explorers are using high performance and adaptive computing to tackle challenges across disciplines like science, medicine and manufacturing, transforming the lives of those around them.

To protect the environment and move toward a more circular economy, it is important to promote proper reuse, recycling and disposal of electronic products.

We are helping make better use of our planet’s limited natural resources by engineering our products for longer life, reducing the number of devices potentially needed to begin with and, in some cases, helping design for modular CPU and GPU upgrades to enable backward compatibility with our customers’ existing systems.

High performance and adaptive computing are transforming our lives.

These technologies, including arti cial intelligence, are enabling exciting advancements in scienti c research, STEM education, energy and climate, healthcare, data centers, communications and automotive.

Together with our employees, partners and customers, we are working to drive further advancements, while recognizing our responsibility to help mitigate undesired impacts.

Digital Impact Why It Matters Our lives are increasingly dependent on and intertwined with technology.

What we thought was impossible yesterday may not only be possible today, but fast becoming part of the fabric of our lives.

Combined with human ingenuity, our advances in semiconductor technology and high performance and adaptive computing are accelerating research to enable the solutions we need for the future.

AI is the de ning technology shaping the next generation of computing and our most strategic long term growth opportunity.

With this immense opportunity comes the challenge of keeping the technology focused on positive outcomes and helping solve some of humanity’s most complex problems.

While we take the opportunity to extend our impact by putting leading edge technology in the hands of the world’s researchers, entrepreneurs and creators, we recognize our industry’s responsibility to protect and enable people’s right to share in scienti c advancement and its bene ts.

And while the goal is to improve our world, we recognize the potential unintended negative impact our technology could have.

The same technologies that promote equity and increase efficiency can also be deployed in ways that potentially disadvantage vulnerable communities or contribute to environmental degradation.

One way to address the opportunities and risks from technology is to expand access to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education.

According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report (2018), 75 percent of jobs will be related to STEM areas by 2025 this includes roles at AMD.

By inspiring and encouraging tomorrow’s leaders, we can help them develop the skills and knowledge they need for a STEM career, ultimately helping enable them to make a positive impact on society.

At AMD, we do not operate in isolation: while we create solutions that stretch the perception of what is technically possible, we innovate for users.

We believe that in the hands of the best and brightest, our technology can help address our shared challenges, so we can create a better future together.

This makes it vital for us to understand the goals of our customers and partners and work together to pursue a shared vision.

We therefore engage and collaborate with stakeholders to design world class high performance and adaptive computing solutions that users can put to work to spark new ideas that bene t society, as well as to mitigate the potential negative impacts of the technology itself.

Our approach entails fostering strategic relationships with researchers, nonpro ts, educators and students who are positioned to expand horizons and develop the groundbreaking innovations of tomorrow.

Whether it is donating technology to help develop students’ sense of discovery or enabling scientists to responsibly push the boundaries of what is possible, we believe that when processing power meets brainpower, the future comes alive.

AMD is also committed to working with the industry to innovate and deploy AI responsibly.

We aim in part to deliver AI solutions, making the bene ts of AI pervasive while enhancing energy efficiency.

We will also work to enable an open ecosystem to give broader access of resources to the AI community and accelerate innovation.

We established an internal cross functional Responsible AI Council that is de ning parameters and guidelines based on industry frameworks like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), UNESCO and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) principles.

We intend to shape both our internal usage of AI and to collaborate with the industry to design AI for good while reducing risks.

We will invest in research and education to increase access to technology and advance research to reduce risks and shape public policy.

As a leader in high performance and adaptive computing to address the world’s most compute intensive workloads, AMD strives to enable and implement environmental solutions in our products, supply chain and operations, while accelerating energy ef ciency improvements across our product portfolio.

Environmental Sustainability Why It Matters AMD has a part to play in mitigating climate change including making our products more energy efficient and by powering the research needed to transition to a low carbon economy.

This is not only a future challenge the related issues are already manifesting.

Globally, the 10 warmest years on record have all occurred since 2010, with the last nine years (2014 2022) among them.

The International Panel on Climate Change has stated that an average temperature increase of 1.5 C is the threshold for dangerous global warming.

Beyond this, they foresee a risk of severely destabilizing social and economic structures around the world.xvii An immediate and meaningful global response is required to address the climate crisis.

Accelerating the transition to a sustainable low carbon economy is intended to produce bene ts for economic growth, promote the health of people and our environment and increase resilience to natural disasters.xviii The technology sector plays a critical part in maximizing product energy efficiency and enabling opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across society.

Our Approach At AMD, we embrace the responsibility to protect our planet and the opportunity to help others save energy and reduce GHG emissions.

Our environmental programs and initiatives extend across our value chain, and we set ambitious goals and publicly report annually on our progress.

Addressing Environmental Impacts at AMD and in Our Supply Chain Reducing AMD operational GHG emissions in line with science based targets, while working closely with direct manufacturing suppliers to advance environmental performance.

Advancing Environmental Performance for IT Users Optimizing system level energy efficiency to help our customers and end users save energy and advance their sustainability goals.

Innovating on Collaborative Solutions to Address Environmental Challenges Enabling innovative solutions that optimize renewable energy generation, enhance smart solutions and power cutting edge climate and scienti c research.

AMD and our industry continue to mobilize and scale climate action, particularly for Scope 3 emissions, which occur outside of an individual company’s operations.

For instance, CDP estimates that supply chain emissions are on average 11.4 times higher than operational emissions.xix Because AMD operates in a fabless business model through carefully selected external suppliers to manufacture our products, our approach to environmental sustainability takes into account where we have control and where we have in uence.

For instance, AMD continues to pursue a science based GHG emissions reduction goal for our operations (aligned with a 1.5 C scenario) while charting a bold path to advance energy efficiency for accelerated computing applications.

Meanwhile, we work closely with direct manufacturing suppliers to increase efficient use of resources and renewable energy while investing in stakeholder engagement to support industry efforts.

AMD was selected in 2022 to be a founding participant in the Responsible Business Alliance’s Senior Environmental Advisory Taskforce, in addition to our continued role serving on the Board of Directors and as vice chair.

The taskforce shapes the sustainability strategy for the world's largest industry coalition dedicated to CR in global supply chains.

AMD also joined many of our suppliers and customers when we became a founding member of the Semiconductor Climate Consortium in late 2022 with its focus on GHG emissions across the electronics value chain.

AMD continues to be an active participant and collaborator in several workgroups.

In 2022, AMD was again honored to be named a CDP Supplier Engagement Leader for our efforts in the supply chain and related goals, governance and industry collaborations.

This honor is reserved for the top 8 percent of the nearly 20,000 CDP survey respondents (in 2022) deemed to be taking leadership actions to help reduce emissions and climate risks in the supply chain.

Progress on both of our environmental supply chain goals was impacted by the addition of new manufacturing suppliers due to the acquisitions.

Although some suppliers have GHG reduction goals and source renewable energy, the overall increase in suppliers led to a lower percentage to goal in 2022 compared to 2021.

AMD technology can make a signi cant impact in reducing a company’s carbon footprint while maintaining its compute performance.

In 2022, BNP Paribas opened a data center in Sweden, using a circular economy approach.

By partnering with AMD and others, the new chosen solution not only has a lower environmental impact but also makes a positive contribution to the local economy.

The data center increases BNP Paribas CIB’s computing grid by 20 percentxx.

Using direct liquid cooling, the center sells its waste heat to the City of Stockholm, where it warms up to 20,000 homes.

BNP Paribas wanted to reduce their carbon footprint without compromising on performance, and after testing several options, they chose state of the art, high core AMD CPUs that could save up to 30 percent in power consumption for the same compute capacity.

With more efficient CPUs, per BNP Paribas, they could reduce the number of servers they required, saving power and cooling costs.

We are laser focused on improving energy efficiency, doing as much as possible compute per watt of power consumed.

Our commitment to environmental sustainability is re ected in our long standing corporate values and culture.

For 28 years, we have been transparently reporting on our environmental initiatives and performance.

With outsourced manufacturing operations, we include supply chain manufacturing in the scope of our environmental initiatives and goals, in addition to our global operations and product designs.

Following the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando in 2022, we are reporting 2022 calendar year environmental data for the combined company.

Within AMD operations, we aim to reduce energy use and resource consumption while aggressively reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (aligned with a 1.5 C scenario since 2014).

As of December 31, 2022, AMD operated more than 90 locations worldwide, including engineering facilities, sales and business service sites and corporate offices.

Across our facilities, we strive to apply the highest level of integrity and stewardship for environmental performance.

Our Global EHS Standards provide the corporate level environmental, health and safety framework for the development of best in class programs for our worldwide operations.

These Standards are consistent with widely recognized management systems, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard for environmental management.

Two of our sites in San Jose, California and Singapore are certi ed to the ISO 14001 standard.

After exceeding our 2014 2020 GHG goal for operations, we set a new science based target (aligned with a 1.5 C scenario): a 50 percent absolute reduction in GHG emissions from AMD operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2030 (2020 base year).

Following the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando in 2022, we recalculated our base year energy use and operating GHG emissions to re ect the combined company.

As a result, our 2020 baseline for energy use changed from 123 to 199 GWh, and our operating emissions (market based) changed from 30,009 to 61,754 metric tco2e.

In 2022, we achieved a 19 percent reduction in operating emissions (market based) compared to revised 2020 baseline.

Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions have received external limited assurance.

Within our operations, our major corporate campuses account for the greatest energy use and associated GHG emissions.

Our global energy use increased 7 percent from 2020 to 2022.xxi We increased the sourcing of renewable energy in 2022 to 66 GWh for the combined company.

AMD is evaluating ways to continue increasing renewable energy sourcing over the next three to ve years and beyond, aligned with our business strategies.

For 2022, in addition to sourcing renewable energy from third parties, our San Jose campus utilizes onsite solar generation: there is a large 1.4 MW solar system comprised of 3,600 panels elevated in the parking lot to provide shade for 500 employee parking spaces.

The campus also features an additional 600 kW rooftop solar installation.

The solar con guration can store excess energy generation in a 1 MWh battery storage system for later use when building loads are high and when utility rates are most expensive.

We are also able to send surplus energy back to the power grid for the local community to use.

To reduce energy and GHG emissions as outlined in our internal Global EHS Standards, major AMD sites maintain an inventory of emissions of global warming substances, including GHG emissions resulting from the sites’ direct energy use and potential emission sources of ozone depleting substances (ODSs).

We employ strategies to reduce the emission of global warming substances, eliminate or reduce the use of ODSs and decrease the sites’ energy use.

We have also identi ed and implemented additional conservation projects to save electricity.

EPA applauds AMD for its leadership position in the green power marketplace.

AMD is an excellent example for other organizations in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through green power investment and use.

Water and Wastewater To help reduce our use of water resources and to comply with our internal Pollution Prevention Standard, we assess major site activities and processes that could have signi cant impacts on the environment and put reductions strategies in place.

We closely manage the environmental impacts of our wastewater and put industrial wastewater, stormwater and groundwater strategies in place where needed.

In 2022, water use in our operations was 183 million liters.

We continue to utilize rainwater harvesting and reuse gray water at facilities in Austin, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.

In 2022, these three sites harvested more than 23.9 million liters of rainwater, a 74 percent increase from 2021 and over 100 percent of their combined annual water use.

Waste AMD aims to reduce the amount of waste produced through pollution prevention practices.

We characterize, track and manage the chemical, electronic and other regulated waste generated onsite and through nal disposition.

The waste management facilities and transporters we use for the management of regulated waste are audited and approved prior to use and periodically to promote a high level of care.

Our total amount of waste generated in 2022 was 816 metric tons, comprised of 97 percent non hazardous and 3 percent hazardous waste streams.

The non hazardous waste diversion rate, or the amount kept out of land ll, was 80 percent in 2022.

Efforts include recycling and composting 653 metric tons of non hazardous materials.

Supply Chain We work with our direct manufacturing suppliersvi to advance environmental sustainability across a variety of metrics, namely emissions related to purchased goods and services (Scope 3 emissions).

In 2022, we welcomed and integrated several new direct manufacturing suppliers into the AMD supply chain responsibility program.

With each direct supplier, our engagement toward assertive, forward looking progress in environmental sustainability is informed by the supplier’s situation.

Our efforts to advance sustainability in the supply chain include participation and even leadership roles in sector collaborations driving towards a 1.5 C pathway.

Silicon wafer manufacturing accounts for the bulk of our environmental footprint within our supply chain.

Since 2014, we have partnered with our direct wafer suppliers to track performance against EHS metrics for AMD wafer production.

Our work together aims to outperform industry averages across metrics that include energy use, GHG emissions, water use, hazardous waste recycling and injury and illness rates.

Looking ahead to 2025, we have public goals for all of our direct manufacturing suppliers, and we report on our progress annually.

By 2025, we aim for 100 percent of them to have their own public GHG reduction goal(s) and 80 percent to source renewable energy.x Although our performance on these goals decreased slightly in 2022 due to the addition of new suppliers from the acquisitions, we achieved 70 percent of our direct manufacturing suppliers having public GHG goals and 68 percent sourcing renewable energy in 2022.

We are in contact with each of our new direct manufacturing suppliers to share information about our CR goals and available industry resources.

OverviewCR Focus AreasAbout Our Reporting2022 23 AMD CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT23  In 2022, AMD collaborated with the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) to host a water conservation webinar for our company and other suppliers in Mandarin Chinese.

We continue to work with key direct manufacturing suppliers to promote water conservation, particularly with factories in high water risk regions,xxvii where we expect suppliers to demonstrate water conservation and risk mitigation efforts.

For example, in 2022, our primary wafer foundry supplier, TSMC, was the rst semiconductor company to receive AWS Platinum Certi cation.

We work closely with our wafer foundry suppliers to address the generation of waste in our supply chain.

During 2022, our direct wafer manufacturing suppliers achieved a 93 percent hazardous waste recycling rate an increase from 80 percent in 2020.xxvi AMD continues to work with these suppliers and other direct manufacturing suppliers to track and aim to improve waste metrics, including material reuse and waste reduction and diversion programs.

GHG emissions in our supply chain are primarily generated at silicon wafer manufacturing facilities directly through fuel use or indirectly through electricity consumption.

In 2022, these direct foundry suppliers reduced their Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by about 9 percent compared to 2020, based on an AMD manufacturing index (MI) accounting for wafer size, complexity and quantity.xxv Despite the increased efficiency, absolute emissions increased over this time period due to more advanced technology nodes that require more electricity and increased desire for AMD technology.

Our aim is to increase renewable energy use by our primary foundry manufacturing suppliers by 2x from 2020 2025.

We will also begin to take steps to forecast GHG emissions in our supply chain and identify near term mitigation efforts.

A speci c focus area, which is re ected in our industry collaborations, is increasing renewable energy availability in Taiwan, where most AMD wafers are manufactured.

Through our founding membership in the SEMI Climate Consortium, AMD is encouraging participation by our supplier manufacturers in the region to identify key opportunities and barriers for advancing renewable energy infrastructure.

The contracted wafer manufacturing stage is the point in our value chain at which the most amount of water is used and the most effluents generated.

AMD works closely with our foundry wafer suppliers to understand water risks at the locations where AMD products are manufactured and to track and manage water use.

In 2022, the foundries reduced water use by 13 percent from 2020, per AMD MI.

Despite the improved efficiency, absolute water use increased over the same period.xxvi Looking ahead to 2025, we are working with our direct wafer manufacturing suppliers to continue to reduce water use by a goal of at least 5 percent or more per AMD MI compared to 2020.

More advanced technology nodes require more water use during the manufacturing phase, so these suppliers are working to increase the capacity for water reclamation.

AMD in North America: Planting 2,000 Trees For Earth Day 2022, AMD partnered with nonpro t Neighborhood Forest on their 13th annual Free Trees for Kids program.

Neighborhood Forest’s mission is to give every child the joy of planting a tree and watching it grow.

They do this by giving free tree saplings to kids through schools, libraries and youth groups for Earth Day.

Neighborhood Forest plants tens of thousands of trees every year and reached their goal of 40,000 trees planted in 2022.

AMD committed to plant 2,000 trees across North America through a charitable grant to Neighborhood Forest.

In conjunction with the AMD Go Green employee resource group, AMDers across nine sites signed up to plant nearly 500 trees, and the company donated another 1,500 trees to be gifted to children through Neighborhood Forest’s annual distribution.

We are honored and delighted to partner with AMD to give more children this priceless experience.

We’re spreading joy and smiles, beautifying neighborhoods, and putting a signi cant dent in our carbon footprint, all while instilling a sense of magic, wonder and love for our planet in the hearts of our little ones.

OverviewCR Focus AreasAbout Our Reporting2022 23 AMD CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT23    Our goal delivering a 30x increase in energy efficiency for AMD processors and accelerators powering servers for HPC and Arti cial Intelligence (AI) training from 2020 2025 represents a 2.5x acceleration of the industry trends from 2015 2020 as measured by the worldwide energy consumption for these computing segments.

As of mid 2023, we are on track toward achieving 13.5x improvement in energy efficiency for AMD processors and accelerators from the 2020 baseline using a con guration of four AMD Instinct MI300A APUs (GPU with integrated 4th Gen EPYC Genoa CPU).v Our goal utilizes a measurement methodology validated by renowned compute energy efficiency researcher and author Dr. Jonathan Koomey.

Advancing Environmental Performance for IT Users We strive to create products that improve people’s lives and help our customers and end users reduce their own energy use and GHG emissions.

We collaborate closely with our customers and partners on product design and system level optimizations to advance environmental sustainability, including by reducing environmental impacts and energy use.

Energy efficiency is paramount when it comes to supercomputing, which is the concentration of processing power across multiple parallel computers.

AMD powers seven of the top 10 most energy efficient supercomputers, according to the Green500 List published in June 2023, and we received a 2022 SEAL Sustainable Product Award for innovative and impactful products purpose built’ for a sustainable future in data centers.

Product Energy Efficiency Maximizing the computing performance delivered per watt of energy consumed is a vital aspect of our business strategy.

Our products’ cutting edge chip architecture, design and power management features have resulted in signi cant energy efficiency gains.

In the data center, AMD EPYC processors power the most energy efficient x86 servers, delivering exceptional performance and reducing energy costs.xxx AMD EPYC processor based technology drives energy efficiencies by meeting application performance demands with fewer physical servers than competitive solutions, which can result in a reduced data center footprint and associated energy use and GHG emissions.

For example, to deliver 2,000 virtual machines, it takes an estimated 11 2P AMD EPYC 9654 powered servers or 17 2P Intel Platinum 8490H based servers.

By engineering our products for longer life, reducing the number of devices potentially needed to begin with, piloting product takeback initiatives and, in some cases, designing for backward compatibility with our customers’ existing systems, we can help make better use of our planet’s limited natural resources.

At AMD, we take our commitment to supporting long product lifecycles very seriously.

For example, in 2022, AMD announced that we are extending the product lifecycle for all Xilinx 7 Series devices launched between 2011 2015 until at least 2035.

By designing these long lasting products, which are used in markets like industrial, automotive, aerospace and medical, we can help reduce the environmental impacts associated with manufacturing new products.

In the data center, AMD EPYC processors are designed to meet application performance demands with fewer servers.

As a result, data centers can reduce electricity use and GHG emissions for IT infrastructure as well as for cooling data centers, while avoiding added raw materials that need to be extracted, shipped, manufactured and disposed of.

In many cases, AMD powered server and desktop CPU sockets are backward compatible with the previous generation processor, meaning the CPU can be upgraded using the existing motherboard.

As a result, processing power can be increased without the cost or environmental impact of replacing the entire system.

In 2022, AMD, in partnership with Microsoft, launched a regional pilot product takeback campaign in Indonesia and Vietnam for customers to trade in used electronics and upgrade to a new Windows 11 PC powered by an AMD RyzenTM processor.

Based on positive feedback from users, this initiative will be expanding to South Korea and potentially to otherregions in 2023.

The efforts aim to address a societal challenge related to the approximate 40 million metric tons of electronic waste (e waste) generated every year, with only 12.5 percent recycled according to some sources.xxxii This means that most e waste is sent to land lls and incinerators, releasing harmful toxins into the air.

By trading in old devices, we can help give old tech a new life and reduce our impact on the planet by encouraging the recycling and proper disposal of e waste while also improving energy efficiency.

AMD is committed to promoting the highest levels of compliance across the many standards that govern different industry management systems.

As a member of JEDEC, AMD works with customers and suppliers to comply with industry standards.

We strive to help reduce the amount of hazardous substances in our products.

AMD complies certi cations and standards, such as RoHS and REACH, to meet the highest requirements for quality, safety and environmental protection.

For more information, please visit our product environmental compliance.

Product Packaging Packaging materials are used for the shipping and handling of our products to consumers both processors in a box (PIBs), graphics cards, FPGAs and adaptive SoCs, evaluation boards, system on modules and Alveo accelerator cards.

AMD speci es the packaging materials used, including the recyclability of materials and the use of recycled content.

We offer packaging that meets the amended requirements of the EU Packaging Directive (94 62 EC).

Smaller packaging conserves natural resources and reduces shipping fuel use and emissions per unit.

In 2022, we continued to reduce the size of our packaging for select Ryzen PIBs by an average of 66 percent compared to the previous generation.xxxiii Our packaging designers continuously seek out environmentally preferable packing materials, including non toxic dyes.

Innovating on Collaborative Solutions AMD collaborates with enterprises, researchers and others to help them put our technology to work solving some of the world’s most pressing environmental challenges.

Imagine a world where the performance and upgradability of a desktop is blended with the exibility of a laptop.

To help make this a reality, in 2023 we collaborated with Framework: a laptop manufacturing company that aims to reduce environmental impact by designing modular products to last longer through easy repair and upgrade, maximizing the use of recycled and recyclable materials and nding ways to extend life through reuse.

Framework also works with carbon sequestering company Running Tide to purchase carbon capture in order to make each laptop carbon neutral.

In 2022, AMD EPYC processors helped entrepreneur Accelerate Wind to design more efficient rooftop wind turbines by increasing its turbine simulation performance by 15 times.

AMD EPYC processors also continued to optimize wind turbine orchestration for energy solutions company Vestas so that power lost due to wake turbulence can be reduced for greater renewable energy generation and improved value.

Going back over a decade, AMD embedded solutions have been used in wind turbines to help optimize the production of clean energy.

AMD server processors are also helping to advance the adoption of cloud computing, which is forecast to prevent emissions of more than 1 billion metric tons of CO2 from 2021 2024 due to higher server utilization rates, more energy efficient operations and more renewable energy sourcing.xxxv AMD EPYC processors are used to power cloud instances ranging from big data analytics to virtual desktops.

As more enterprises move their computing applications from on premises data centers to cloud based data centers, they may see server utilization rates increase, more efficient energy use and new possibilities for renewable energy sourcing.

While helping to enable solutions to reduce energy and carbon emissions, AMD also aims to help researchers better understand the interrelated forces contributing to climate change and develop solutions to help mitigate the impact.

By analyzing massive and complex data sets, scientists can learn insights into the causes of climate change and even predict the impact of extreme weather to help save lives.

For example, two of the AMD powered Top 500 Supercomputers (June 2023) the Meteo France supercomputer and the LUMI supercomputer in Finland are used for weather and climate research.

Azure Cloud Maximizes Remote Productivity for TBI As one of the largest networks of construction companies in the Netherlands, TBI certainly has the power to reach its key objective: to make a better world for people and for the environment.

With the Triodos Bank in Driebergen, the Netherlands, it built one of the most sustainable bank buildings in the world using a cloud based virtual desktop solution that delivered major bene ts to the construction site, speci cally in the way engineers and site managers access plans and designs.

With a green roof, solar panels and natural provision of light, air and water, the building is completely energy neutral.

And at the end of its life, its unique wooden construction means it can be easily disassembled and the parts and materials reused.

Entertainment Imagination knows no limits in the entertainment world.

That is why AMD pushes for faster rendering with the world’s most advanced processor.

From special effects to virtual production to 3D modeling, we are empowering lm, television and game creators to realize their visions.

AMD is a proud founding member of the Greening of Streaming, a user group of like minded technology and service provider organizations that are focused on establishing standards and practices to improve sustainability in the streaming industry.

AMD is also an active and proud contributor to working group six, working collaboratively to de ne the Low Energy Sustainability Streaming (LESS) Accord, which aims to set standards around sustainable streaming.

Eco Labels AMD works closely with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) during product design and after product launch to increase the proportion of products meeting various eco labels.

As government agencies around the world look to incorporate sustainability requirements into their IT buying decisions, they use standards such as ENERGY STAR, EPEAT, TCO and others in their public procurement tenders.

Most eco labels and certi cations are evaluated at the system level, (i.e., a computer or server), but the processor can contribute to how well a system performs on a given standard.

For example, AMD works with our customers to help improve ENERGY STAR ratings by optimizing processor energy efficiency as measured at the system level, in conjunction with other components and peripheral devices.

AMD also helps OEMs to meet the system level eco label certi cation EPEAT, which includes environmental criteria such as supply chain greenhouse gas reductions, materials selection and environmental management system certi cation.

Communications As data consumption continues to grow rapidly, driven by technologies such as streaming services and 5G broadband connectivity, AMD processors are helping meet demand while reducing power consumption.

For example, France headquartered Ateme achieved approximately a 50 percent reduction in power consumption with its advanced video encoding platform enabled by AMD EPYC processors, while delivering better video quality.

On broadband infrastructure where data consumption is growing by 30 percent per year according to experts, cloud native software and physical broadband technology solutions provider Casa Systems was able to break the record for throughput by using 3rd generation AMD EPYC to achieve their goal of industry leading performance and carbon footprint reduction from 5G networks.

JOCDN Empowers Broadcast Video Streaming with AMD EPYCTM CPUs Video content distribution poses a performance challenge for data center hardware while delivering the performance cost effectively.

Broadcasting joint venture JOCDN is at the forefront of delivering video in the Japanese market.

The company is constantly looking for the best processing power for the money, to maintain competitiveness and enable the development of new services.

When JOCDN started to nd its existing infrastructure was limiting its opportunities for growth, the company began looking for an alternative platform.

JOCDN deployed 32 core 2nd Gen AMD EPYC 7502P processors to double throughput while reducing CPU usage by about 40 percent and power consumption by about 20 percent compared to its previous servers.

In other words, JOCDN was able to spend less on energy with AMD EPYC processors for a comparable workload, while still having capacity for future load increases as its business expands.

Our longstanding relationships with our supply chain partners enable us to create shared value for our customers, workers across our global supply chain and the communities in which we operate.

AMD aims to support our suppliers in advancing supply chain resiliency, respect for human rights and environmental sustainability.

Supply Chain Responsibility Why It Matters AMD is a key part of an extensive global supply chain creating products to advance high performance and adaptive computing that helps to enable the future.

By using our collective in uence, the semiconductor industry’s supply chain continues to be one of the most important levers for creating a positive impact in the world.

According to one analyst, each segment of the semiconductor value chain has, on average, 25 countries involved in the direct supply chain and 23 countries involved in supporting market functions.xxxvi Supply chain sustainability can make a signi cant impact on advancing human rights, fair labor practices and environmental progress.

While the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic began to ease in 2022, our supply chain must remain resilient some experts expect increased demand for semiconductors across the industry over the next decade.xxxvii Semiconductors have become essential to our modern world,xxxviii and their end users are increasingly diverse.

This brings a responsibility to take individual and collective steps for our products to be produced responsibility and ethically.

Consequently, stakeholder expectations for transparency and data driven results will remain a focus for our company in 2023.

Together with our supply chain and industry partners, AMD embraces the opportunity to meet demand while driving social and environmental progress in the supply chain.

We are committed to delivering high quality products and helping enable working conditions throughout our supply chain to be safe, workers are treated with respect and dignity and the manufacturing processes of our products are environmentally responsible.

As AMD is a fabless semiconductor company, our manufacturing operations depend on a carefully selected network of suppliers.

The scope of the AMD Supply Chain Responsibility (SCR) program encompasses the manufacturing of our products by suppliersix located in Asia, Europe and the United States and the sourcing of raw materials.

The acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando in 2022 expanded our supply chain we incorporated both companies' manufacturing suppliersix into the AMD SCR program by communicating AMD expectations and conducting assessments with new suppliers.

Our wafer foundry suppliers source raw materials and create a silicon wafer.

The wafer is fabricated into chips, assembled into a package, tested and shipped as a semiconductor ready to be used by our customers.

Following the acquisitions in 2022, the majority of our supplier spend approximately 62 percent is with foundries that supply these wafers.

Another 25 percent of our spend is with factories that manufacture a range of inputs needed to create our products.ix Concentrating our spend on key manufacturing suppliers enables us to take a long term approach with them, which is paramount to our success.

AMD primary manufacturing suppliers include Global Foundries, Micron, Samsung Electronics, SPIL, SK hynix, TF AMD and TSMC.

Although AMD achieved this goal in 2022, we will continue to engage suppliers in capacity building activities on topics such as setting GHG reduction targets, sourcing renewable energy, ethical recruitment and worker engagement.

In late 2022, AMD became a founding member of the newly formed Semiconductor Climate Consortium, a group formed by companies in the semiconductor ecosystem focused on the challenges of climate change.

Aligned with the Paris Agreement, the Consortium works to speed industry value chain efforts to reduce GHG emissions in member company operations and in other sectors of our value chain.

In addition to AMD, the Consortium has grown to about 80 semiconductor companies including Applied Materials, ASML, GlobalFoundries, Micron, Samsung Electronics, SK hynix and TSMC. Member companies collaborate with the aim of identifying solutions that can reduce the environmental impact of the semiconductor industry, such as reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions, improving water usage efficiency and promoting the use of renewable energy.

As a fabless semiconductor company, our scope 3 emissions exceed our scope 1 and 2 emissions.

As this newly formed group aims to progress its work, AMD is engaging with industry participants to explore opportunities to reduce emissions.

AMD participates in discussions to explore the challenges and opportunities for our suppliers to access renewable energy in regions worldwide.

AMD also joined the Environmental Risk Reporting and Mitigation Working Group.

The Consortium also engages with policymakers, NGOs and other stakeholders to promote sustainable practices in the semiconductor industry and advocate for policies that support the transition to a low carbon economy.

Respecting Human Rights At AMD, we respect human rights throughout our company, operations and supply chain.

We work to uphold the relevant fundamental rights and freedoms of all people across the business, in line with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Labour Organization’s (ILO’s) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

The AMD CR and Legal teams are responsible for establishing and coordinating the policies, programs and processes that govern our approach to human rights.

Our Human Rights Policy re ects our commitment to the UNGPs. This policy extends to our supply chain, and the AMD Supplier Code of Conduct further incorporates human rights requirements expressed in international norms and standards.

In 2023 we worked with BSR, a global sustainable business network and consultancy, to conduct our rst Human Rights Saliency Assessment.

We prioritized the timing of this exercise to follow our major acquisitions in 2022 and re ect expansion of our global presence and products.

BSR conducted the assessment in alignment with the UNGPs to identify the most important (salient) human rights issues for AMD based on the risk of severity of impact to rightsholders and the likelihood of their occurrence.

The process included input from AMD executives, customers, suppliers and international NGOs.

As a result of the assessment, AMD gained a more holistic view of where our human rights risks lie, how they are interconnected, how to prioritize them and what areas merit deeper examination.

We are using this information to take the next steps in expanding our human rights strategy.

AMD was included in the KnowTheChain benchmark for the rst time in 2022 we ranked 14 out of a total of 60 companies in the ICT sector benchmark.

AMD was highlighted for being one of only a few companies that monitor the repayment of fees below a tier one manufacturing supplier.

We gained valuable insight into where we should focus improvement efforts, and starting in 2023, we are incorporating this information into our programming.

We aim to work with our direct manufacturing suppliers to advance supply chain resilience, respect for human rights and environmental sustainability.

We take a partnership approach with these suppliers to promote continuous improvement and drive positive change across our value chain.

In 2022, 100 percent of AMD Sourcing Managers completed the annual training course on supply chain responsibility, which included our Supplier Code of Conduct standards, preventing risks of forced labor to vulnerable workers and supplier performance.

AMD is a full member and vice chair of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA).

AMD adopts the RBA Code of Conduct as our Supplier Code of Conduct (The Code).

It outlines our supply chain standards for labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems.

Our SCR program resides under the Corporate Responsibility (CR) team, which reports to our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer.

The CR team works cross departmentally to help operationalize the day to day management of our program and policies.

Our Corporate Vice President of Purchasing receives updates on supplier performance to SCR requirements quarterly and more frequently when necessary.

The AMD Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct outline our expectations for our ethical conduct, and these standards extend to our key business partners and suppliers.

Because we want them to help expand the reach even further, we require each direct manufacturing supplier to communicate the same expectations to their suppliers in turn and implement reasonable mechanisms to monitor their compliance.

Stakeholder expectations related to the supply chain continue to evolve, raising opportunities for increased collaboration to tackle some of the world’s most important challenges.

We believe collective action drives greater impact than one company acting alone.

For this reason, multi stakeholder partnerships are an important aspect of managing our supply chain responsibly.

AMD collaborates with industry groups, peers, suppliers and other stakeholders to make supply chains across the industry ethical and sustainable.

In 2021, AMD was elected to the Responsible Business Alliance Board of Directors to help guide its strategic direction toward achieving its mission and vision.

Over the past two years AMD has advised RBA on enhancing its risk assessment tools, prioritizing focus on climate change mitigation efforts and strengthening relationships with public policy makers and other industry groups.

We actively participate in the Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI), which helps us keep current on regional industry hiring trends, potential risks and best practices.

We utilize RLI’s tools to support a harmonized approach to address the root cause of forced labor risks and accelerate positive change for the workers in our supply chain.

We also work with our suppliers and our industry through the Responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI) to promote the responsible sourcing of raw minerals.

The RMI is a central actor that helps members advance responsible mineral sourcing by promoting common tools, assessments, training and on the ground projects for the electronics industry and beyond.

We encourage our suppliers to utilize RMI tools and best practices to implement industry alignment across the value chain.

AMD is a member of Information Technology Industry Council (ITI). We actively participate in several ITI committees, including Environment and Sustainability, advising on how the broader technology industry contributes to responsible sourcing within global supply chains and addressing climate change.

Additionally, in 2022, AMD joined two groups to help advance industry wide supply chain environmental sustainability.

AMD was chosen to serve on the newly formed advisory group, the RBA Senior Environmental Advisory Taskforce.

In this position, we will help guide RBA’s strategic direction of climate change mitigation.

Risk Assessment Although we strive to adhere to the highest standards and support our suppliers to do the same, social and environmental risks in the supply chain persist and will continue to evolve.

At AMD, we take a risk based approach to managing our supply chain, which includes utilizing data from various sources to identify areas of risk.

With the expansion of our supply chain, as of 2023, AMD conducts a social and environmental risk assessment on potential new direct manufacturing suppliers as part of the quali cation process.

The RBA risk assessment tool accounts for factory location, product type and country risk, providing us with insight into the inherent risks in our supply chain.

AMD requires all direct manufacturing suppliers to complete the RBA Corporate Self Assessment Questionnaire (Corporate SAQ) and Facility Self Assessment Questionnaire (Facility SAQ) which serve as additional input to the risk analysis.

Results of the SAQ combined with the inherent risk score produce an overall risk score, which in uences our approach to supplier engagement.

The Facility SAQ is an important tool that helps us monitor the risk of forced labor.

AMD engages any direct manufacturing supplier that does not meet these criteria to reiterate the requirements and obtain evidence that they are promptly met.

In our supplier assessments we also use research reports, including the RLI Labor Migration Corridor Database, which provides data on high risk migration corridors and average employment fees and publications by NGOs and academics.

Additionally, we take part in multi stakeholder discussions to inform emerging risk.

Our standard contractual terms and conditions for the procurement of goods and services require conformance to our Code of Conduct and applicable laws and regulations.

We also continually work to streamline and reinforce our expectations through regular supplier communications.

For example, in 2022, we launched the AMD Supplier Responsibility Guide.

This guide enables us to formally share our expectations with our direct manufacturing suppliers and provide resources to support their success.

These suppliers can now share the AMD Supplier Responsibility Guide with their suppliers, thus extending our expectations further upstream in the supply chain.

Pursuant to our supply chain responsibility audit goal, we use third party audits where available, to verify the supplier has a policy and systems in place to communicate our expectations to their suppliers and monitor their compliance.

Supply chain responsibility performance is incorporated into the overall supplier scorecards we use to incentivize suppliers for strong labor and environmental performance.

AMD employees from the Procurement and CR teams participate in supplier business reviews, which include a discussion on the scorecard.

We recognize many of the industry’s SCR challenges and opportunities reside beyond our direct manufacturing suppliers.

In 2022, we participated in industry workgroups to evaluate approaches and tools for mapping the industry’s supply chain.

In addition, we piloted an initiative to extend visibility to sub tier suppliers.

Based on our research and information learned through supplier SAQs, we prioritize training for direct manufacturing suppliers that employ at risk, vulnerable groups in our supply chain.

Our capacity building programs in 2022 focused on equipping them with knowledge and tools to prevent forced labor in their workplaces with a focus on best practices when recruiting and employing migrants.

For the second year in a row, AMD sponsored a supplier to attend the RLI’s Ethical Recruitment Due Diligence training workshop.

The workshop included best practices to protect workers from COVID 19 and focused on key risks in the recruitment of foreign migrant workers: document retention, contract terms and conditions and recruitment fees and related costs.

As a result, the supplier hosted a training to increase awareness among foreign migrant workers on how to mitigate the risk of contracting COVID 19 while living in dormitories and made adjustments to the transportation schedule to allow for increased social distancing.

Additionally, management updated its grievance procedure to streamline communication with migrant workers.

As well, suppliers in Taiwan participated in training speci c to local, forced labor risks.

We also assigned training through the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)’s e Learning Academy based on identi ed knowledge gaps.

For example, in 2022, suppliers took training on social responsibility supply chain management, forced labor prevention and managing air emissions.

This training was available at no cost to the suppliers, on demand in multiple languages.

As part of our goal for 100 percent of our direct supplier manufacturing factories to have a Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) audit or equivalent by 2025, we prioritize factories for third party RBA audit based on risk pro le, percentage of AMD spend and past audit performance.

Each year we report publicly on our direct manufacturing suppliers’ annual audit nonconformances, and each quarter we review related performance with our Global Operations executive team.

This review covers priority and major nonconformances from these audits, corrective action plan status, including closure rates, and overall performance.

In 2022, within our direct manufacturing supplier base, 55 RBA Validated Assessment Program (VAP) audits took place across Greater China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and the United States.xli The average initial VAP audit score for AMD suppliers in 2022 was 13 percent better than the overall RBA average over the same time period.

Suppliers are expected to take action to remedy nonconformances and to prevent possible future negative impacts.

Based on RBA protocols, AMD monitors improvement by measuring the number of priority violations, repeated violations, frequency of nonconformances and Corrective Action Plan (CAP) closure status.

We track nonconformances from the release of the audit report through closure.

In some cases, suppliers are required to create a CAP and share it with AMD, ensuring they meet the deadlines and requirements set out by the RBA VAP Protocol.

In some cases, they may need to arrange an onsite third party closure audit or submit sufficient evidence addressing the root cause of the issue.

We engage with suppliers and support them to remedy their nonconformances by creating and closing the CAP.

When necessary, AMD Sourcing Managers support suppliers to adhere to improvements and the associated deadlines.

Depending on the severity of the issue, discussions may be elevated for a more in depth conversation between company executives.

As we engage with a supplier in this process, if they are not following the RBA CAP closure timeline, AMD executives will be informed so appropriate action can be taken.

Third party audits are a valuable tool to assess whether workers have access to mechanisms to voice concerns, if any, and access remedy when needed.

As part of the RBA audit protocol, some workers have the opportunity to be interviewed and this feedback provides insight into actual workplace conditions.

Additionally, RBA tracks a Quality of Life Metric.xlii This metric is based on three indicators: availability of money (having more than is needed to pay personal bills), time (to focus on enjoyable things) and good health (in order to enjoy the money and time).

The score is calculated by isolating questions in the VAP audits that measure these three indicators.

Workers in the AMD supply chain scored 57.6 on RBA’s Quality of Life Metric, compared to the industry average of 51.9.

In 2023, we plan to launch our rst worker voice survey, as a pilot for future expansion.

We are steadfast in our commitment to environmental sustainability, and that includes working with our direct manufacturing suppliers to evaluate and continuously improve performance.

Given the amount of energy and water needed in the wafer fabricating process, silicon wafer manufacturing represents the bulk of our environmental footprint in our supply chain.

We have set 2025 performance metrics for our wafer foundry suppliers, and we track progress each quarter.

In addition, we track water use, energy use, GHG emissions and waste across our direct manufacturing suppliers.

For several years AMD has collected this data from about the top 80 percent of our direct manufacturing suppliers by spend.

In 2021, this data collection and engagement represented 89 percent (by spend) and in 2022 we expanded to approximately 95 percent (by spend).

AMD has again been recognized by CDP as a Supplier Engagement Leader (2022), an honor awarded to only the top 8 percent of CDP survey respondents.

Our efforts in 2022 23 prioritized climate challenges in the supply chain, both through broader industry efforts as well as direct supplier engagements.

For example, we worked with several individual suppliers and the RBA to strengthen expectations and resources for manufacturers to set science based targets for their Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

Tracing the origin of minerals to the point of extraction is a complex challenge but is essential to a responsible and resilient supply chain.

AMD efforts to break the link between the minerals trade and con ict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo began in 2008.

Through industry initiatives and collaboration with our supply chain, we work to support the responsible sourcing of minerals from con ict affected and high risk areas (CAHRAs), including the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries.

As we learn more about potential social and environmental impacts, we continue to assess our supply chain, and we have prioritized minerals beyond tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TG) and cobalt for additional due diligence.

Our approach is based on the ve steps of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Con ict Affected and High Risk Areas (OECD Guidance).

To enhance our due diligence, we focus on managing risks and improving traceability in the supply chain.

AMD works with direct manufacturing suppliers to map the relevant smelters and re ners within our supply chain utilizing the RMI’s reporting templates, suchas the Con ict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT).

In 2022, we updated our Responsible Minerals Policy (previously called the Con ict Minerals Policy) to progress our desire to expand due diligence globally and to a broader set of materials.

We surveyed AMD direct manufacturing suppliers for 10 new materials beyond 3TG and cobalt.

About Our Reporting companies or mineral traders and implement corrective actions to comply with industry standards.

We leverage our participation in RMI to do this, and we contact smelters and re ners directly when they are at risk of not completing the RMAP CAP process or are unwilling to maintain the RMAP certi cation.

We continue to maintain 100 percent of smelters and re ners participating in RMAP.

Our primary goal is to work with direct manufacturing suppliers to support improvement when necessary, but in some cases, it becomes necessary for AMD to require these suppliers to disengage from a smelter or re ner when our industry standards are not met.

This can have unintended economic and humanitarian consequences for local communities.

AMD has strong partnerships with our direct suppliers.

Therefore, we work together to assess the impacts of disengaging from raw material sources and together promote responsible sourcing.

We are committed to growing diversity in our workplace, supply chain and industry at large to help embrace different viewpoints and experiences, foster innovation, challenge the status quo when needed and drive business performance.

In the supply chain, we have a geographically diverse set of suppliers, including manufacturing suppliers in Asia, Europe and North America, as well as thousands of non manufacturing suppliers globally.

In 2022, AMD (excluding the recent acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando) spent US 14.9 million with diverse suppliers in the U.S. approximately 52 percent more than in 2021.xliii The available spend data is from registered U.S. businesses that include women owned (US 8.3 million), minority owned (US 5.7 million), small (US 3.8 million) and veteran owned (US 57,600) businesses.

AMD may have spent more with minority suppliers but this is not known, because we rely on supplier reported designations.

In 2022, AMD supported small businesses by engaging in various initiatives.

We were proud to partner with our customer Lenovo on their Evolve Small initiative that funds grants, technology upgrades and mentorship opportunities for small businesses throughout the U.S. and Canada.

For instance, 30 grant businesses were identi ed to receive 12 months of mentorship and networking from Goodie Nation (a nonpro t partnering with Lenovo), up to US 10,000 each and an AMD powered Lenovo ThinkBook laptop.xliv Leadership of the small businesses were also invited to participate in a mental wellness session with a small business coach and therapist.

Through the initiative, these small businesses received technological support to strengthen their systems and processes to help elevate their day to day business operations.

AMD also co sponsors the Data Trade Gateway program, which is in partnership with North Carolina State University.

Professors at ve North Carolina Historically Black Colleges and Universities (Bennett College, Fayetteville State University, Johnson C. Smith University, Winston Salem University and Livingstone College) teach students how to use data analytics and visualization software.

Each of the students is paired with a local black owned business to apply analytics to a real world problem that the business is trying to solve.

Each of the students and business owners received a Lenovo AMD ThinkBook laptop to support the software and their growth.

This program ran through the Spring semester of 2023.

We value the health and safety of workers in our supply chain.

With our two primary wafer foundry suppliers, we aim to see a year over year reduction of the cumulative reportable injury and illness case ratexlv in 2022, the rate increased by 25 percent compared to 2021 but remained up to 50 percent below the historical 2019 2020 levels.xlvi Extending to our other direct manufacturing suppliers, we utilize RBA audits to identify health and safety code violations, which most often relate to emergency preparedness.

Diversity strengthens our company performance and culture.

At AMD, we believe that including as many unique voices and viewpoints as possible accelerates innovation.

Diversity, Belonging Inclusion Why It Matters People are what powers AMD: to transform lives through high performance and adaptive computing, we strive to attract, acquire, develop and advance the most engaged, diverse and inclusive workforce in the semiconductor industry.

As our industry aspires to expand innovation across emerging and fundamental technologies, we recognize the value of diversity among the technologists and achievers that will design, deliver or use them to solve the world’s most important challenges.

This means improving representation at AMD and across our industry.

In particular, Black and Hispanic workers remain under represented in the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) workforce in the United States.

Women are also signi cantly under represented in STEM occupations, making up a quarter or fewer of the workers in computing and engineering.xlvii Issues related to global societal expectations and the availability of childcare continue to play an in uential role in the choice of educational tracks and career trajectories.xlvix While research shows the needle is moving forward, as a society we need to do more to support women in the transition to a technology powered future.

At AMD, we are committed to appropriately growing our population of women and other under represented groups across all levels of the organization.

With a more diverse and inclusive workforce, we can continue to provide exceptional leadership products and strong business performance.

We make AMD stronger by building a diverse talent pipeline, encouraging a culture of respect and belonging and increasing the inclusion of under represented groups.

AMDers who champion and, when needed, challenge our company culture with their unique perspectives.

With this foundation of diversity, we foster an inclusive workplace where innovation thrives.

We elevate our talent and improve business outcomes by encouraging employees to bring their whole selves to work, unleashing the full potential of each employee.

This in turn creates a sense of community and purpose what we at AMD call Belonging.

In our annual AMDer Survey, we ask multiple questions on how our culture and processes support our commitment to DB I.

Our AMDer Survey scores have increased steadily and signi cantly over the past several years, and in 2022, we saw our highest scores to date (see page 54).

Results for every survey dimension and index listed scored at or above external benchmarks for high performing companies within the tech industry.

While we do not rely on external recognition to continue our work toward a more diverse and inclusive company and industry, honors and awards re ect our commitment and show the dedication of our people.

In 2022, we were recognized by the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the fth consecutive year.

Inclusion in the Bloomberg GEI demonstrates our commitment toward equal representation of gender at all levels of the company and a commitment to equality goals.

We are proud that Pro les in Diversity Journal recognized our diverse AMD talent in the Women Worth Watching category, the Black Leadership Awards and the Latin Leadership Awards.

In 2022, 51 percent of AMD employees contributed to activities under this goal through participation in ERG membership, employee volunteerism and charitable donations.vi This slight decrease from 52 percent in 2021 is due to the large number of new employees joining the company from our acquisitions we plan to address this by engaging them within the regions and business units where we currently see lower engagement.

For example, in 2023, we are launching an internal campaign supporting these employees so they can become part of the AMD ERG community.

Diversity is integral to our business at AMD, and we want to go beyond representation to lead the fabless semiconductor industry in inclusion, and continue to develop underrepresented talent in engineering roles.

Starting in 2021 and continuing through 2022, we made these efforts a component of our company’s strategic metrics and milestones to inform our annual incentive plan, which is a compensation element of our Total Rewards Program.

Representation of female engineers and other URGs increased considerably at AMD over the ve years prior to 2022.l While we did not realize an increase in representation in 2022, we continued our practice of attracting new hires that are more diverse than our existing employee base.

Additionally, our ability to engage and retain female engineers is a competitive advantage, and retention remains consistently high over the last several years.

Looking forward to 2023 and beyond, we will seek continued improvement in the representation of URGs and female engineers through company wide initiatives, such as the Advancing Women in Tech program that we rolled out in 2023.

Superwomen in Semiconductors: Supporting Future Engineers in Our Industry The Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA) launched its Women’s Leadership Initiative in 2019 to address the gender gap in our industry and promote the advancement of women.

The Initiative is led by the GSA Women’s Leadership Council, which includes Ruth Cotter, Senior Vice President, Marketing, Communications and Human Resources.

They and others share their time and experience to inspire and sponsor the next generation of female leaders.

The Initiative works with member companies to develop and implement programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace.

These programs include mentoring, leadership development, training and other efforts to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for women in the industry.

In 2022, the GSA hosted its annual agship Women in Semiconductor Hardware conference, which AMD co sponsored.

The event brought together industry leaders, entrepreneurs, university students and professionals to connect and celebrate women.

The gathering returned in person and opened with a keynote from Dr. Lisa Su, AMD Chair and CEO.

Ruth Cotter shared remarks during lunch and breakout sessions and panel discussions followed, one of which was led by Suzanne Plummer, Fellow and Corporate Vice President, HR, Talent and Diversity at AMD.

Ruth spoke to the audience about the importance of being a Mentor, Advocate, Coach (MAC) and highlighted key initiatives at AMD that support diversity and belonging.

Suzanne continued the conversation around empowering women in the conference’s nal panel.

Joined by women from GlobalFoundries, Synopsis and other companies, the discussion shed light on their experiences navigating work and life, the employment gap and the challenges of returnship for companies and employees.

Like the companies represented in the discussion, our goal at AMD is to empower everyone to advance and enable our programs to help people reimagine their careers.

AMD employees Pei Yao, principal staff engineer, and Bernice Zee, senior member of technical staff, presented their research in conference breakout sessions.

Caixia Xiang, corporate vice president of Software Development at AMD received the 2022 Rising Women of In uence Award.

During the event, Dr. Su awarded a multi year grant to the GSA Women’s Leadership Initiative to fund programs and initiatives that support female engineering students to consider careers in the semiconductor industry.

The grant assists the Initiative in hosting keynote speakers, panelists, career guidance and other networking events to help students connect with leading companies in the semiconductor industry.

We are grateful to continue advancing the efforts driven by GSA. And we are proud to celebrate the women who have helped break the glass ceiling and those who are following in their footsteps.

AMD publishes workforce diversity statistics as part of our annual CR reporting.

We also review our Diversity, Belonging Inclusion strategies and metrics with members of the AMD Board of Directors.

We are constantly striving to improve our gender and diversity representation through speci c programs.

Talent Attraction and Retention Intense competition continues for talent in the semiconductor industry, with companies vying to attract and retain skilled individuals to help them innovate and bring the most successful products and services to market.

AMD aims to be an employer of choice, with passionate, innovative, fully engaged employees.

Our voluntary turnover of 9.5 percent for 2022 was equal to 2021 and remains low compared to semiconductor industry benchmarks.

Turnover for women at AMD has trended consistently lower than for men over the past several years.

Recruitment We recognize the importance of increasing the representation of women and other under represented groups in engineering and continue our efforts to recruit diverse talent and foster an inclusive and innovative culture, where the best ideas win, regardless of the individual’s identity.

The population of university students in our North America internship and co op programs continued to grow in 2022, resulting in the largest summer cohort in AMD history.

With that opportunity, we were able to expand our outreach to female and under represented talent in engineering and in partnerships with the Society of Women Engineers and National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) at some of our partner universities like MIT, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Toronto.

Year 2022 re ected renewed engagements as the students returned to their universities in person and we were able to visit campuses for various events.

Seeing them face to face and engaging in conversations with students, professors and staff allowed us to get some direct insight on the challenges of navigating through a curriculum during the pandemic.

However, it was also interesting to see the shift from wanting all on campus events to a preference of hybrid events with a larger majority of them being virtual.

This approach provides greater opportunity to introduce AMD on campus and discuss available jobs.

Furthermore, it allows us to explore new ways to drive diversity recruitment.

We continued to grow our visibility and credibility at HBCUs as we partnered with the Howard University NSBE Chapter for a Tech Talk and held an AMD Lobby Day at North Carolina A T.

Our company’s Intern Co op Program is robust and intended to provide an enjoyable opportunity for learning and development outside of the academic setting.

We are committed to helping students and graduates expand and apply their theoretical knowledge while building on the job and focused goal speci c skills.

The program also promotes student networking while at AMD, peer to peer events, participation in training to develop interpersonal skills and interaction with AMD senior leaders.

Immersing the students in the AMD culture can help inform their future career decisions and gain a head start in applying for a full time position.

AMD in Canada: Supporting Diverse Students at the Start of a Tech Career AMD enables an encouraging environment for under represented groups including through partnership with local universities in Canada.

For example, in 2022, AMD partnered with the University of Toronto to support the Women in Science Summit at Hack the Valley, with McMaster University to support a Women in Engineering Alumni Night and with Toronto Metropolitan University for an information session, a masterclass and a Women in Engineering Co op Panel.

Additionally, AMD collaborated with McMaster University and the National Society of Black Engineers.

AMD takes a 360 approach to Canadian student development, incorporating social and professional development, communications and gaming.

Our Intern Steering Committee (ISC) is a pivotal part of our Intern Co op program.

By taking part in the ISC, students can build new connections, deepen company culture and learn the ability to manage professional and social commitments in the workplace.

In 2022, the ISC led an AMD Canada Intern Innovation Showcase, where co op students could share their innovations to 3,000 of their local colleagues.

The ISC held the BioMed Talks: a series of seminars from several full time employees at AMD who are experienced in biomedical research or the industry.

The ISC also organized the Buddy System Matching Program, to pair new co ops with more experienced ones, as well as networking and social events such as the Intern Jackbox Party, an online series of party video games designed for various group sizes.

Our talent management activities support the complex and dynamic nature of our business, but our goal is simple: deliver our strategy by having the right talent in place now and in the future.

Throughout the year, our CEO and senior executives hold cross functional discussions about our top talent and the leadership and technology skills our business requires.

AMD is committed to offering or exceeding a living wage to our employees that covers the cost of basic needs at the local level.

AMD employee base pay is benchmarked to the competitive high tech market of companies our size, with our midpoint targets at or above the median of the market.

AMD is committed to providing a exible and inclusive workplace that enables our employees to do their best work.

Using local data, regulations, job requirements and an employee survey, AMD has enabled a dynamic approach to exible work across many sites.

This allows eligible employees a choice in their exible work schedules: onsite (3 or more days week in office), hybrid (1 2 days in office) or remote (working majority from home).

We believe that our commitment to workplace exibility not only makes our company a great place to work, but also helps us attract and retain top talent from around the world.

AMD in Singapore: Inspiring Tomorrow’s Women Engineers To mark International Women’s Day 2022 and the BreakTheBias theme, AMD in Singapore took part in a number of events and initiatives.

The AMD Women’s Forum (AWF) livestreamed a reside chat by regional leaders.

We also sponsored the Semiconductor Women’s Forum 2022, organized by the Singapore Semiconductor Industry Association (SSIA).

The event encourages diversity and inclusivity in the workplace and celebrates women in the semiconductor and electronics industry.

During the event, SSIA streamed the BreakTheBias photo montage the AWF created to raise the pro le of our women engineers.

We also participated in outreach managed by the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) Singapore.

As an SWE company, we took female students from the Institutes of Higher Learning on a company tour.

The two hour event was fully booked with 60 participants, who learned about the AWF and how diversity, belonging and inclusion are part of our company culture.

On a typical business day, unless a lesser amount is required under local rules, employees are generally required to work 8 productive hours of work, amounting to typically 40 hours of work per week.

If necessary, additional hours might be required for performing duties competently based on business needs, and these are handled in compliance with local rules.

Our Total Rewards programs re ect our commitment to having an equitable and inclusive environment that enriches the total wellbeing of our employees.

By offering market competitive, inclusive bene ts that our employees value most, AMD enables an environment where we can all do our best work.

Compensation, bene ts and services may vary by location and according to employee eligibility and classi cation.

They are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective plans and programs.

AMD in India: Supporting Career Development for Women In 2022, the AMD Women’s Forum (AWF) in India led a virtual panel event to celebrate International Women’s Day.

The panel featured women at AMD India, who spoke about holistic career development support for women.

Jaya Jagadish, senior vice president, silicon design engineering and country head India, opened the event.

Speakers included Aparna Mandke, Anupama Rasale and Sunita Jain, who are AMD principal members of technical staff (PMTS).

They were joined by Padmini Gopalakrishnan, senior director, and Shailaja Cheruvu, manager.

The discussion centered around building up women around you, and the panelists shared their thoughts on meaningful ways of accomplishing this objective while avoiding potential pitfalls.

They also talked about the importance of mentoring, career mantras and access to networking.

Another virtual panel discussion organized by AWF India aimed to support women’s health.

The Women's Health and Future session was proposed and enabled by our Human Resources team in conjunction with Mercer Marsh the health bene ts provider for AMD in India.

During the event, a panel of doctors specializing in women's health covered topics including nutrition for women and hormonal imbalance.

We promote an environment of continuous learning at AMD.

Employee education and training are provided in different forms and vary by country.

In some countries, we offer tuition assistance programs and other learning programs, such as Leadership Training, Skillsoft Learning, TED Talks and Microsoft curriculum.

In 2022, we launched New Employee Orientation Workshops: rolling monthly workshops that target speci c topics and allows new hires to learn in depth information about subject areas that are important to starting their career at AMD (performance management, career development, stock plans, IT and cybersecurity and DB I).

AMD Leadership Essentials is a learning experience designed to help newer people managers (with less than one year of management experience at AMD) build their leadership capability and provide the core skills necessary for them to be successful at AMD.

The training has been offered virtually to accommodate our workforce, which includes onsite and remote employees.

In 2022, we offered 28 classes, and 778 new people managers attended these classes to enhance their onboarding experience into people management practices at AMD.

The global Learning and Development and Sales Enablement teams offered over 177,800 hours of training education to employees in 2022, including both virtual and onsite instructor led trainings on the topics requested by our employees most frequently.

Our education portfolio covers interpersonal skills development for executives, people managers, technical leaders, sales leaders and individual contributors.

Courses include topics such as communication and presentation skills, career advancement, leading effective meetings and prioritization, delegation, compliance, sales product training and sales enablement.

In 2022, we brought back our Top Talent Programs with onsite delivery after a pause during the pandemic.

We delivered three Manager Leadership Experience programs with a total of 122 participants and three Technical Staff Experience programs with a total of 119 participants.

Our Unconscious Bias training was created by AMDers with a focus on how bias may show up at AMD.

In this training, participants learn to interrupt the unconscious beliefs that may negatively affect processes, decisions and interactions and create a workplace where AMDers feel they can belong and contribute to the success of the organization.

We also created Lowering the Waterline, an internal podcast featuring authentic conversations about diversity, belonging and inclusion.

Additionally, AMD e learning resources include huge, constantly growing libraries of courses from Udemy, Skillsoft Percipio and LinkedIn Learning, as well as book summaries from getAbstract and thousands of articles from Harvard Business Review.

Under our pay for performance philosophy and guiding principles, we reward not only team members who demonstrate the highest level of contribution to the company, but also those who continually improve their capabilities.

This helps ensure that rewards are differentiated based on the impact the employee’s performance has on the company, as well as how they execute their tasks.

Employees are actively engaged in the performance management process.

Employee Engagement We know that AMDers do their best when they are fully engaged and can be themselves at work.

In our video series, I Am AMD and Career Engineered, AMD employees share their stories and unique voices.

We released new videos throughout 2022 to highlight our inclusive workplace environment.

Our employee resource groups (ERGs) encourage employee engagement and are an important part of our company’s culture.

While we had affinity groups for years most notably the AMD Women’s Forum (AWF) we introduced a corporate ERG policy in 2016 to clarify the process and encourage the formation of other groups.

ERGs create a space for employees who share a common identity, along with their allies, to meet and support one another in building their community and sense of belonging in the workplace.

At the same time, our ERGs empower employees by giving each group a collective voice to work with senior leadership and increase understanding of their community.

With the acquisition of Xilinx in 2022, we added two new ERGs Incredible India and Multicultural bringing the total to 13.

Although Pensando did not bring new ERGs into AMD upon acquisition, former Pensando employees have been invited to participate in all of our ERGs.

By combining our voices and sharing ideas and best practices, we have ampli ed efforts to build a stronger culture ERG events helped bring further inclusion to the combined company.

We recognize and capture cultural differences in the way we do events, how we communicate and the way we are structured.

AccessAbility: Serves AMDers living with disabilities personally and professionally by creating a culture of inclusivity through shared experiences, helpful resources and collaborative activities.

Listening to Our Employees AMD employees are our most important stakeholder group.

We use a suite of surveys and other tools to listen to employees at various points throughout their career at AMD to measure engagement and culture and to hear their ideas for how we can continue to improve.

Our annual AMDer Survey is sent to all of our employees around the globe, and there was a 96 percent response rate in 2022.

Engagement Index: An emotional and intellectual commitment to AMD, their team and their job.

Manager Quality Index: Management engaging hearts and minds with day to day interactions and decisions.

Belonging Inclusion Index: A work environment in which all individuals are treated fairly, have equal access to opportunities and resources and can contribute fully to our success.

Personal views and values are respected, allowing employees to be themselves at work.

Our AMDer Survey scores have increased steadily and signi cantly over the past several years.

Results for every survey dimension and index listed here scored above external benchmarks for high performing companies within the tech industry.

While we are pleased with these results, we strive for continuous improvement in all areas of the AMD employee experience by respecting and leveraging our employees’ voices.

Many of our historical investments, programs and policies put in place to improve employee engagement and operational excellence originated from feedback received through our employee surveys.

In 2022, this included improvements to our Recharge Days program to include three additional global paid days off, the addition of a oating holiday in the U.S., continued exibility in work location and signi cant investments in engineering infrastructure, to name a few.

Workforce Health and Safety For more than a decade, our Global Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Standards have established excellence as the benchmark for AMD sites around the world.

We require all our facilities to meet applicable local, regional and national regulations.

In addition, we set and apply standards that go beyond this: we establish premier practices based on an assessment of risks and hazards across all aspects of the organization to protect employee health and safety.

In general, these EHS Standards are designed to be consistent with internationally recognized management systems such as ISO 14001 (Environmental) and ISO 45001 (Health and Safety).

Health and safety related areas addressed under our Global EHS Standards include operational controls to mitigate risks for example, injury and illness prevention through personal protective equipment and ergonomics, emergency preparedness and response and electrical, equipment and chemical safety training and monitoring controls for example, equipment and area inspections, audits and corrective action review and closure.

As a result of acquiring Xilinx in 2022, two of our new sites in San Jose, California and Singapore are certi ed to the ISO 45001 standard.

Our company's workforce injury and illness case rate remains below the industry average, although this number increased slightly in 2021 and 2022, largely due to COVID 19 related illnesses.

With zero fatalities, no high consequence work related injuries or illnesses and 12 total cases in 2022, including pandemic related illnesses, sprains and strains, our worldwide case ratelii for the year was 0.04 per 200,000 work hours.

This is signi cantly lower than comparable industry case rates reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

We also track health and safety metrics for our wafer foundry suppliers, with the aim of improving safety performance year over year.

Several measures have helped our case rates remain low.

Throughout the COVID 19 pandemic from 2020 through 2022, AMD utilized a global health team of registered nurses who managed contact tracing efforts to provide personal assistance to employees and helped reduce the potential for workplace transmission.

To address potential ergonomic issues encountered by employees working from home, we provided additional training, virtual ergonomic assessments and an equipment allowance to help mitigate risks these programs continue in 2023.

In addition, AMD consistently communicates requirements and best practices.

Our Global Health, Safety, Security and Physical Security (HSSE) Employee Handbook and Global HSSE Contractor Handbook outline requirements that are relevant to employees and contractors, respectively.

These include information on preventing and reporting injury and illness and near misses.

We require all employees to take an ergonomic training course as well as an HSSE Orientation course that provides an overview of health and safety requirements.

Speci c training is also assigned based on job duties to help prevent illness and injuries.

Volunteerism is a core part of the AMD culture, and our generous and committed colleagues are always ready to give their time through company sponsored volunteer opportunities.

It is an essential element to our success and culture, and we value our employees’ devotion to causes that are close to their hearts and advance AMD values.

Community Involvement Why It Matters We have a passion for giving back to the communities where we live and work.

For over four decades, AMD has invested in organizations around the globe that meaningfully impact the way we live today and help create a better tomorrow.

Our employees have come to expect this spirit of giving from AMD, and most importantly, so have our communities and neighbors.

CORPORATE AND EMPLOYEE GIVING We provide charitable grants to nonpro t organizations and promote a year round charitable employee matching and volunteer rewards program.

AMD FOUNDATION GIVING The AMD Foundation provides grants that support global community initiatives that align with the company’s interests.

EMPLOYEE VOLUNTEERISM We encourage our employees worldwide to share their time and talents through community volunteering at AMD sponsored events and individual activities.

AMD HPC FUND INVESTMENTS We provide research institutions with high performance computing (HPC) resources to accelerate research in areas such as climate change, healthcare, transportation and big data.

AMD Day of Service: Employees Provide Over 350,000 Meals to Fight Hunger In addition to year round volunteering, AMD hosts an annual AMD Day of Service as a company wide celebration of community volunteerism.

During our 7th Annual AMD Day of Service in 2022, AMD invested in a signi cant effort to ght hunger locally and globally.

Partnering with the nonpro t organization Rise Against Hunger, 11 AMD sites in India, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Singapore and the United States hosted meal packing events to empower and nourish communities and respond to severe emergencies and disasters.

More than 1,100 volunteers spent 2,175 hours shoulder to shoulder assembling nutritious food for distribution to areas in desperate need of a safety net.

It was great to see our team coming together in the ght against hunger.

It is inspiring to know we played a small part in solving a global humanitarian crisis and that a simple meal, which we often take for granted, will make such a big impact on someone else's life.

I am glad AMD encourages employees to give back with our time and resources throughout the year.

Additionally, multiple sites in Canada, the United States and Singapore hosted local food drives and worked in food banks to support families in their own communities struggling with food insecurity.

Collectively, during this seventh annual event, AMD employees helped ful ll a variety of our nonpro t partners’ needs through 70 different events across 25 AMD sites worldwide.

In total, more than 3,500 people donated nearly 8,650 hours of volunteer time for Day of Service in 2022.

Giving back to our communities and creating a sustainable future for others are vital.

That's not only my personal belief, but also part of the AMD culture.

AMD Community Volunteering Around the globe, AMD volunteers are easily recognized by the bright green volunteer t shirts they wear.

These shirts have become a symbol of our culture of generous and committed colleagues ready to give their time and talent.

AMD nurtures this culture through company sponsored volunteering and provides opportunities for teams to connect while giving back.

In 2022, nearly 5,000 AMDers logged more than 17,000 hours of volunteer time through individual and team based activities, such as planting trees, cleaning parks, assembling STEM education kits, building tiny homes for veterans and providing meals for families experiencing food insecurity.

AMD in India: Collaborating Locally to Support Women and Girls on a Path to Employment In 2022, as part of our aspiration to secure sustainable livelihood opportunities for women in India from disadvantaged communities, we extended our community programs that aim to help women and girls through education.

The lack of required skills creates a major challenge to employment of some women in India today.

To address this, AMD funds the Skill Bharath program run by CHORD India, which provides skill training for employability for underprivileged and vulnerable women in Hyderabad.

With the support of AMD, more than 1,200 women aged 18 to 35 have already taken part in the training toward independence.

In 2022, we renewed our support in a project that aimed to empower 160 women with training in tailoring and textile design.

All 160 women enrolled in the Skill Bharath program completed the course.

The training aimed to build their con dence and make them more competitive in the employment market.

Following the program, the participants either secured decent work or started home based enterprises with the aim of achieving nancial independence.

Our community efforts are also focused on helping younger women and girls for the country’s future workforce.

This includes supporting girls in their education through our long term partnership with Udayan Care Foundation.

The Udayan Shalini Fellowship Program aims to bene t girls from lower income backgrounds with educational and nancial support and experimental learning.

The girls receive individual mentoring from our workforce and their families are invited to take part in counseling.

The program also helps the girls broaden their horizons and encourage them to become socially responsible citizens.

Operating from October 2022 to March 2023, AMD supported 15 girls and their families, helping them improve life skills and understand the importance of learning.

AMD in Singapore: Uniting to Build Culture and Support Communities The AMD Community Service Committee paint project returned in November 2022 after a two year break, and we were ready to roll up our sleeves.

Working in partnership with Thye Hua Kwan Moral Charities’ Indus Moral Care Seniors Activity Centre, nearly 60 AMD Singapore volunteers gave 13 apartments a makeover, helping people in need feel more at home.

We painted, plastered and cleaned, learning new skills along the way and some company departments used the opportunity as a team building event, making it doubly meaningful.

Many of our employees choose to use the company’s Matching Gift and Volunteer Reward Program to amplify their personal donations with a 1:1 match by AMD to eligible nonpro t organizations.

During the year, we organized a donation drive to raise money for a variety of nonpro t organizations nominated by employees, including Boys’ Town and Ahuva Good Shepherd Children’s Home.

During the drive, AMD and our employees contributed a total of S 13,000.

AMD is committed to publicly reporting clear and transparent ESG data and sharing our progress, as we continue to evolve our internal processes and external disclosures to meet stakeholder expectations, as well as developing regulatory guidelines and standards.

Reporting Standards and Frameworks The 2022 23 Corporate Responsibility Report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (2021).

In addition, the report includes climate related disclosures included in the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as well as relevant disclosures in applicable Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards.

AMD also annually reports to CDP on climate change and water, as well as reports on how AMD is helping advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Reporting Scope and Boundaries Unless otherwise stated, the information and data provided pertain to the period January 1 to December 31, 2022.

Our reported data re ects all AMD operations, and it includes data resulting from the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando.

In accordance with the GHG Protocol, we have incorporated 2020, 2021 and 2022 operational energy use (electricity and fuels) and related GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) for the two acquired companies into our operational GHG data.

This is because AMD had a public GHG goal with a base year prior to the acquisitions (2020).

We have revised our 2020 Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions goal baseline to re ect the operational boundary of the combined company.

For water, waste and other environmental metrics for AMD operations, we are reporting 2022 data for the combined company (including the acquisitions) but not for prior years, because AMD did not have related public goals at the time of the acquisitions.

We received external limited level assurance in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised for 2022 data on our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and related performance against ve of our CR goals, as well as Scope 3 GHG emissions for business air travel.

While our commitment to being a responsible corporation does not rely on recognition, it is a meaningful validation of our work when external organizations rank us alongside the top sustainable companies.

We are proud to be honored with the recognitions on the right.

Summary ESG Data Tables The following tables provide data on our social, environmental and economic performance.

Additional disclosures and data can be found on our website.

For 2020 and 2021 data, only energy and Scope 1 and 2 GHG data from Xilinx and Pensando are included in support of recalculating base year 2020 and 2021 energy use and related operational GHG emissions.

We also generate onsite renewable energy in the U.S. and source renewable energy through utilities in the U.S. and in Ireland.

About Our Reporting lxiii AMD estimates scope 1 emissions from refrigerants such as hexa uoroethane (HFE) and hydro uorocarbons (HFCs), and fuel used such as diesel and natural gas.

Emission factors for fuels are based on the GHG Protocol Calculation Tool (Global Warming Potential Values) and refrigerants in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report or manufacturers' published information.

The scope is based on operational control (i.e., AMD occupied facilities).

We follow the GHG Protocol, the internationally recognized standard for the corporate accounting and reporting of GHG emissions.

The method includes Site Metrics Coordinators entering monthly values into AMD’s central database where emission factors are applied.

Note: A previous version of this data table incorrectly reported fugitive emissions stemming from refrigerant releases as Air Emissions: Ozone Depleting Substances.

The AMD EHS team is not aware of any production, import or export of Ozone Depleting Substances.

Emissions from refrigerant releases are included in our Scope 1 values.

AMD Site Metrics Coordinators enter the amount of electricity used each quarter into AMD’s central database.

AMD follows the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the internationally recognized standard for the corporate accounting and reporting of GHG emissions.

Emission factors for locations in the U.S. are based on eGRID total output emission rates, and for outside the U.S. are based on International Energy Agency (IEA) national electricity emission factors.

If electricity use data is not available, as for small offices, then an average value for U.S. office buildings is used for all AMD locations (16.9 kWh sq ft) based on EIA CBECS results for the average administrative office, and the emission factor for the location is applied.

AMD sources renewable energy through utility providers (U.S., Ireland) and third party certi ed renewable energy credits (RECs in the US and Singapore iRECs in China and India), as well as generates renewable energy onsite in the U.S.

Note: In September 2023, AMD updated its previously reported Scope 2 market based values for 2020 2022 to re ect residual mix emission factors using Green e Residual Mix Emissions for USA and other country speci c residual factors where available, in accordance with the GHG Protocol.

In 2022, we included Xilinx and Pensando in our upstream emission estimates, but not downstream due to lack of available data at the time of our annual reporting.

Our value chain emissions are estimated following the guidance from the GHG protocol.

Category 1: Emissions associated with Foundry, OSAT and other direct manufacturing suppliers are calculated using Scope 1 and 2 emissions collected from top suppliers, allocated to AMD, and extrapolated to account for direct manufacturing suppliers that do not disclose their emissions.

Emissions upstream of AMD’s Foundry suppliers are then estimated using a manufacturing LCA index speci c to AMD’s highest volume products.

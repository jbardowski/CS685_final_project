Letter from the ESG Steering Committee Chairperson

Over the past year, the world has faced numerous economic, social and geopolitical 
changes, including uncertainties in globalization and free trade, lockdowns caused 
by the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, global transportation bottlenecks, 
and inﬂationary pressures. This has tested the resilience of the global supply chain 
and the adaptability of businesses. As a responsible global corporate citizen, TSMC 
has accelerated the adoption of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) 
initiatives in its operations and industrial value chain, and continues to inject 
positive energy into society.

Prospering with the natural environment is the cornerstone of TSMC's sustainable 
operations, and a green and low-carbon supply chain is an important part of our 
2050 net-zero emissions blueprint. As an industry leader, TSMC uses its green 
inﬂuence to continuously work with suppliers to deepen overall low-carbon 
management. By providing suppliers with guidance on carbon inventory, energy 
conservation, and carbon reduction, we encourage them to adopt carbon capture 
equipment and reduce indirect carbon emissions in the value chain. In 2022, 
TSMC was again selected by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) as a Supplier 
Engagement Leader, and we continued to drive the industry towards low-carbon 
sustainability. In the same year, TSMC's Southern Taiwan Science Park Industrial 
Reclaimed Water Plant started operations, and our Zero-Waste Manufacturing 
Center is expected to start operation in 2023. At our Arizona fab, we also plan 
to build an industrial recycled water plant to gradually achieve near zero liquid 
discharge, advancing toward our goal of circular economy. We continue to make 
every eﬀort to minimize environmental externalities through prudent decision-
making and coordinated global action on four major issues: climate and energy, 
water stewardship, circular resources, and air pollution control. 

As the leading provider of semiconductor process technology and manufacturing 
services, TSMC uses the power of semiconductor innovation to make products 
stronger, smarter, safer, more energy eﬃcient, and more advanced to enrich 
people's lives and empower society for the common good. I am very proud of 
TSMC's employees across the company who work hard for this mission. Guided 
by our Human Rights Policy, TSMC continues to create a working environment 
that respects human rights. This means we provide a digniﬁed workplace that 

is diverse, equal, and inclusive (DEI) and promotes the integration of global 
talents, and we require our supply chain partners to follow the same standards. 
At the same time, we continue to deepen our connection with the society and 
wholeheartedly support global STEM education. Through the TSMC Education 
and Culture Foundation and the TSMC Charity Foundation, we deepen community 
relations, care for the disadvantaged, and preserve national art and culture, laying 
a solid foundation for social progress with common values.

In 2022, we released the UN SDGs Action Report for the ﬁrst time to disclose the 
company's SDGs action plan and progress. We also explained the company's 
management policy on major issues with our Materiality Analysis Report to 
enhance the transparency of sustainable information disclosure. In order to make 
the Board of Directors more comprehensive and transparent and achieve better 
corporate governance, we also prepared for the establishment of the Board's 
Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, which was 
approved in February 2023, strengthening the eﬀectiveness of its sustainability 
governance. The Board of Directors also decided to change the Audit Committee 
to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Compensation Committe to the 
Compensation and People Development Committee to expand and deepen 
its supervision and review responsibilities, making the corporate governance 
structure more robust.

We have a deep understanding of TSMC's key position in the global semiconductor 
industry and its inﬂuence on many economies, and are keenly aware of our 
urgent responsibilities in sustainability that we shoulder as a corporate citizen. 
As TSMC's global business expands, we will deepen our partnership with 
stakeholders including employees, public associations, communities, investors 
and shareholders, and our supply chain and customers, listen to the voices of all 
parties, and open a new chapter of sustainable development together.

Letter from the ESG Committee Chairperson

Looking back on 2022, just as the COVID-19 pandemic showed signs of easing and 
people could see recovery on the horizon, geopolitical conﬂict threw the world 
into disarray amidst systemic risks from crises in energy, food, human rights, 
and environmental damage. Fortunately, substantive progress was achieved at 
the 27th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP 27) and the 15th UN 
Biodiversity Conference (COP 15), so that we were able to continue forwards into 
an inclusive and sustainable future.

Facing a volatile economic environment, TSMC focused on its core competitive 
advantages of Technology Leadership, Manufacturing Excellence, and Customer 
Trust. Strong demand from 5G cellular network and high-performance computing 
applications enabled our total wafer shipments in 2022 to reach 15.3 million 12-
inch equivalent wafers, and realize 12,698 product innovations for customers. 
We also delivered a 13th consecutive year of record revenue, driving sustainable 
development through proﬁtable growth. 

TSMC responded to the call to action at COP 27 by making carbon reduction 
initiatives our top priority. During the course of 2022, we successfully implemented 
823 energy-eﬃciency, water conservation, and waste reduction innovation 
projects. A target of Net Zero Emissions by 2050 was also set with annual progress 
reviews planned to dynamically adjust and set even more ambitious carbon 
reduction pathways. We also drew up the Carbon Credits Quality Standards for 
Voluntary Emissions Reductions based on international guidelines and industry 
benchmarks to ensure that carbon credits are not obtained from sensitive 
regions. Furthermore, we leveraged our industry leadership to invite suppliers 
to participate in the CDP Supply Chain Program. The program complements 
suppliers' existing carbon reduction actions to help us mitigate the global climate 
crisis together. In light of the close association between Climate Change and 
Biodiversity, we issued the Biodiversity Statement for the ﬁrst time in 2022 as a 
climate citizen of the new era. The statement commits TSMC to achieving Zero 
Deforestation, No Net Loss of biodiversity, and Net Positive Impact. Achieving 
Water Positivity was also set as a future strategy to enhance our climate resilience 
as part of a multi-pronged approach.

In addition to our environmental commitments, TSMC also works tirelessly to build 
a diverse, equal, and inclusive working environment. The ﬁrst survey into salient 

human rights issues was completed in 2022, with the establishment of a trans-
organizational human rights working group and due diligence scheduled for 2023. 
The subsequent promotion of preventive, mitigation and remedial measures as 
well as related education and training will ensure human rights protection from a 
stakeholder perspective. We also founded Women@tsmc, an Employee Resource 
Group (ERG) primarily aimed at women, and a new dedicated ERG was set up for 
foreign employees to build employee cohesion and promote career development. 
We also completed the ﬁrst safety culture investigation, and introduced free 
health check-ups on contractor sites to build an inclusive workplace.

Upholding the spirit of Leaving No One Behind, TSMC actively works to achieve UN 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In addition to continuously expanding the 
University Collaboration Programs, cultivating semiconductor talents, and helping 
to meet shortfalls in emergency assistance resources, we also worked to harness 
the power of employee volunteers for youth and rural empowerment, promotion 
of the arts, and assisting the disadvantaged through the TSMC Education and 
Culture Foundation and TSMC Charity Foundation. Using the Business for Societal 
Impact (B4SI) framework as a reference, we also evaluated the overall beneﬁts 
of invested resources and identiﬁed previously overlooked social needs, so that 
TSMC can become a force for positive change.

TSMC is the only semiconductor company in the world to be included in the Dow 
Jones Sustainability Indices for 22 consecutive years. Nevertheless, we don't stop 
there. With the publication of the annual TSMC Sustainability Report along with 
the Environmental Proﬁt and Loss (EP&L) Report, TCFD Report, UN SDGs Action 
Report, and Materiality Analysis Report, we continue to adopt global trends in 
sustainability management, and transparently share TSMC's sustainability journey 
and accomplishments with stakeholders. Looking ahead, TSMC will embrace the 
ESG vision of "Uplift Society" to bring about positive change.

A smartphone is a now a PC in our 
pocket. It can overcome the limitations 
of time and distance to  make work, 
communication, entertainment, and 
life more convenient, including video 
conferencing,  online learning, banking,  
shopping, and travel booking, and 
telemedicine.

Continued advancement of agricultural 
drone technology is a key to sustainable 
agricultural development. GPS-ﬁtted 
drones with a variety of sensors can help 
farmers to make timely adjustments to 
ﬁeld management and improve farming 
eﬃciency and quality, as well as reduce 
waste.

The global automotive industry focuses 
on the four major innovation trends 
of connected, autonomous, shared, 
and electric (CASE). Electric vehicles 
are powered by batteries and do not 
emit harmful exhaust gases on the 
road. This, combined with continued 
progress in advanced driver-assistance 
systems (ADAS), creates a safer and 
more environmentally-friendly driving 
experience.

High-performance portable ultrasound 
scanners are becoming a common 
diagnostic tool.  Unlike bulky traditional 
instruments, they are only the size of a 
mobile phone, and feature faster and 
sharper imaging capabilities, which 
can help medical professionals around 
the globe save time in diagnosis and 
treatment, and improve overall health 
care eﬃciency.

Materiality Analysis and Stakeholder Engagement

Materiality analysis is an important guideline for 
TSMC for formulating the Sustainability Report, 
long-term sustainability goals and stakeholder 
engagement. In 2021, TSMC published its ﬁrst 
materiality methodology guideline to establish a 
knowledge base for ESG management. According 
to the requirements of GRI Universal Standards 
2021, materiality analysis methodology incorporates 
sustainable development-related impact on the 
economy, environment, and people (human rights). 
Please refer to the TSMC 2021-22 Materiality Analysis 
Report for further details.

In response to the latest GRI 3: Material Topics 2021, 
the World Economic Forum (WEF) suggested that 
materiality analysis must consider the concepts of 
Dynamic Process and Double Materiality advocated 
by the European Union. TSMC has established 
TSMC Dynamic and Double Materiality (TDDM) as 
the fundamental analysis process to continuously 
track changes in stakeholders' level of concern 
regarding ESG issues. The Company also formulated 
a materiality analysis methodology based on 
dimensions such as organizational operations and 
sustainable development-related impact.

By consolidating the outcome of the materiality 
analysis in 2021 as well as the sustainability impact 
assessment and the results of the Validated 
Assessment Program (VAP) of the Responsible 
Business Alliance (RBA) in 2022, TSMC has re-
identiﬁed impactful material issues from the three 
dimensions of Stakeholder Concerns, Organizational 
Operating Impact and Sustainable Development 
Impact. At the same time, the Company also 
adjusted the frequency of materiality analysis to 

conduct comprehensive biennial surveys to observe  
changing trends in ESG issues and track the progress 
of long-term goals. The next materiality analysis 
is scheduled in 2023. In the meantime, TSMC 
will continue to collect and respond to feedback 
and suggestions from stakeholders via diverse 
communication channels and the Company's ESG 
Committee will continue to carry out ESG strategies 
and commitments.

for stakeholders, which includes driving output value from the semiconductor industry chain, helping 
customers leverage the competitive edge of products, protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity, 
creating direct and indirect job opportunities, and preventing health or safety hazards. The Triple Bottom 
Line (TBL) is a sustainable impact management framework developed by TSMC. TBL is grounded in the 

Company's six major capitals, four core elements, six sustainable management competencies, and an 
Environmental Proﬁt and Loss (EP&L) valuation model. It aims to, from an Outside-In perspective, measure 
changes and contributions to the well-being of humans from the Company's overall value chain and 
facilitate communication with stakeholders in the hopes of driving economic growth, reducing resource 
depletion, and further bettering the well-being of society as a whole.

Power to Change Society

In the upstream procurement stage, TSMC leverages 
its leadership position in the global semiconductor 
industry to improve the technology and capability 
of local suppliers. TSMC employs an input-output 
model to assess output value, job opportunities, 
and income created from TSMC's procurement 
demands as well as the resulting economic growth 
and improvements in living conditions. To address 
supply chain sustainability issues, TSMC is actively 
promoting a responsible supply chain, using 
environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) 
analysis to identify environmental hot spots in the 
supply chain, and evaluating raw material suppliers 
with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to identify the 
environmental impact from production and service 
processes. TSMC aims to collaborate with suppliers 
to uncover opportunities for change and growth 
to help drive sustainable transformation. In 2022, 
TSMC created an output value of NT$2,070.8 billion 
in the supply chain through procurement, generated 
309,000 job opportunities and NT$238.52 billion 
in payroll through the supply chain. Contractors' 
occupational injuries resulted in NT$1.72 million 
in social costs. The environmental footprints and 
resource consumption generated from raw material 
supply resulted in an environmental cost of NT$16.5 
billion environmental cost. Through consultation and 
goal setting, TSMC will cooperate with suppliers to 
uncover the opportunities for process optimization 
and environment footprint minimization. For details, 
please refer to the TSMC 2022 Environmental Proﬁt 
and Loss (EP&L) Report. 

In the operation stage, TSMC uses a Gross Value 
Added (GVA) approach to assess the positive impact 
generated for stakeholders by operations. Such 
positive impact may include equal employment 
opportunities, competitive compensation and 
beneﬁts, cash dividends, taxes, depreciation 
and amortization, and others. TSMC also applies 
Willingness to Pay (WTP) and Value Transfer to 
evaluate the social cost and beneﬁts of occupational 
injury and volunteer activities. Meanwhile, the 
Company continues to employ environmental proﬁt 
and loss (EP&L) to measure the negative impacts 
generated from energy/resource consumption and 
pollution from the production process. In 2022, 
TSMC generated NT$2,263.9 billion in operating 
revenue, booked NT$437.3 billion in depreciation 
and amortization, and issued NT$285.2 billion in cash 
dividends. TSMC not only helped customers succeed, 
but also oﬀered good returns to its investors. In 
the social dimension, TSMC paid NT$340.9 billion 
in taxes and payroll, supported the government 
in expanding infrastructure and social welfare, 
improved quality of life, and drove economic growth. 
Volunteer services from TSMC also created NT$52.86 
million in social beneﬁts, while occupational 
injuries resulted in NT$9.3 million in social costs. 
In the environmental dimension, environmental 
footprints and resource consumption generated 
from production process or when delivering services 
resulted in an environmental cost of NT$17.89 
billion. To mitigate the environmental impact, 

TSMC proactively drives green manufacturing by 
working on creating positive impact through source 
reduction, energy conservation in manufacturing 
process, circular economy, and terminal control. For 
details, please refer to the TSMC 2022 Environmental 
Proﬁt and Loss (EP&L) Report. 

In the customer use stage, TSMC continues 
to develop world-leading energy-eﬃcient 
semiconductor technologies to help customers 
produce advanced, energy-eﬃcient products 
and facilitate the evolution of energy-saving ICT 
technologies and product applications to fulﬁll the 
commitment to green manufacturing from the 
inside out. The Industry, Science and Technology 
International Strategy Center (ISTI) conducted a 
model analysis based on global energy consumption, 
GDP, and the number of electronic products, 
and found that the products TSMC produces for 
customers will conserve 217,100 GWh in 2030, 
representing four times the energy consumed 
during production and a positive impact of NT$174.2 
billion generated. TSMC eﬀectively facilitates global 
energy conservation by continuing to innovate 
semiconductor technologies to realize smart 
applications for a wide range of electronic products. 
TSMC deployed 288 distinct process technologies, 
and manufactured 12,698 products for 532 
customers in 2022 to continue to bring signiﬁcant 
contributions to the advancement of modern society. 
For details, please refer to Innovation Management

Power to Change Society

TSMC is dedicated to reducing environmental and 
social impacts and introduced EP&L in 2018 to 
evaluate environmental externalities and resulting 
social costs created from the production process. In 
2019, TSMC further applied EP&L to the upstream 
supply chain, converting the environmental impact 
generated from product life cycles into external 
social costs, identifying signiﬁcant environmental 
impact factors to formulate improvement measures 
and reduce the environmental externalities and 
social costs generated from TSMC procurement.

In terms of TSMC operations, in 2022, environmental 
externalities were mainly derived from GHG 
emissions (>96.5%), followed by air pollution 
(1.2%) and waste (1%). TSMC's overall and unit 
environmental externalities increased from 2021 by 

10.6% and 1.3%, respectively, but unit environmental 
externalities decreased by 12.5% compared with 
2018. To reduce GHG emissions, TSMC continues to 
promote low-carbon manufacturing, increase energy 
eﬃciency, and expand use of renewable energy. In 
2022, overseas production locations achieved net 
zero emissions in Scope 1 and Scope 2 for the ﬁrst 
time. To mitigate air pollution, TSMC adopts Best 
Available Technologies (CAT) to reduce emissions 
of two major pollutants – acid & alkali gases and 
volatile organic gases – and further develops new 
technologies to reduce PM2.5 and nitrous oxide 
emissions. To prevent and control water pollution, 
TSMC continues to focus on introducing new 
treatment technologies to lower chemical oxygen 
demand (COD) in wastewater and reduce the water 
pollution composite indicator.

In terms of the supply chain, environmental hot 
spot analysis of the supply chain reveals the most 
signiﬁcant externalities as particle pollutants' 
impact on human health, followed by the social 
cost of carbon from GHG emissions. To reduce 
impacts from air pollution emitted by the supply 
chain, TSMC helps suppliers mitigate pollutant 
emissions from the source through environmental 
protection audit programs. For example, TSMC helps 
suppliers convert oil burners to natural gas burners, 
eﬀectively reducing PM2.5 and GHG emissions, and 
this successful case study was shared with other 
suppliers at the TSMC Supplier Sustainability Forum. 
In addition, TSMC found that chemical materials 
account for 43.2% of environmental externalities 
produced by the supply chain, as such, the Company 
conducted audits on critical raw material suppliers. 

As of 2022, TSMC has audited 95 raw materials and 
discovered that OSAT and Substrate the largest 
number of environmental externalities out of all raw 
materials.

TSMC continues to roll out a variety of green and 
innovative practices to reduce environmental 
impacts from production processes at TSMC 
facilities. TSMC is also asking suppliers to establish 
management systems as well as energy saving, 
water conservation, GHG emissions, and waste 
reduction goals. The company hopes to work with 
suppliers to create a green, low-carbon supply 
chain, reduce environmental impacts from operating 
activities, and create positive inﬂuence on society 
together. For more details, please refer to TSMC 
2022 Environmental Proﬁt & Loss (EP&L) Report.

Case Study

Supply Chain Energy Conservation and Carbon 
Reduction Initiatives

In 2022, TSMC leveraged EP&L analysis to compare chemical and gas suppliers against peers producing the same products and 
using the same raw materials to conduct variance analysis. TSMC discovered that suppliers with ISO 50001 Energy Management 
System certiﬁcates have signiﬁcantly better energy use eﬃciency than those without. Given such ﬁndings, TSMC has formulated 
three major initiatives to help the supply chain conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions.

TSMC hopes to help suppliers evaluate environmental risks and opportunities, reducing resource consumption through a 
series of initiatives targeting energy conservation and carbon reduction. This can further strengthen the supply chain's green 
performance and resilience, striving towards a low-carbon economy.

Carry Out the UN Sustainable Development Goals

To support the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and trends in corporate disclosure, 
TSMC has complied with Integrating the Sustainable Development Goals into Corporate Reporting: A Practical 
Guide jointly published by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and The United Nations Global Compact to 
identify SDGs relevant to the Company, and has published CSR Reports since 2017. In 2022, TSMC further 
adopted ﬁve disclosure categories – Plans, Commitments, Actions, Progress, and Suppliers – deﬁned by GRI 
and Support the Goals to disclose TSMC's practices and progress toward SDGs. The Company also decided 
to expand the single stakeholder from supplier to also cover employees, shareholders/investors, customers, 
contractors,  governments/industry associations, and the society to connect more resources and extend the 
scope of inﬂuence. Achievements in related actions have been published in TSMC's ﬁrst UN SDGs Action Report.

sustainable operations, the Company seeks to 
strengthen its three competitive advantages
Technology Leadership, Manufacturing Excellence, 
and Customer Trust
by protecting technological 
innovations and proprietary information through 
two approaches: patents and trade secrets. For 
technology leadership, TSMC's IP and R&D teams 
work closely throughout each step from the 
beginning of technology planning to risk production 
and volume production. Such teamwork enables 
TSMC to build an IP portfolio for each generation's 
critical innovative technology ahead of schedule, 
including the latest 3nm and 2nm process 
technologies, to ensure the Company's technology 
leadership in the semiconductor industry. In 
manufacturing excellence, TSMC uses rigorous

such as capacity planning, manufacturing process 
management, and information related to intelligent 
operations in the form of trade secrets, while also 
actively applying for patents for manufacturing 
technology with strategic value to secure the 
Company's competitive advantage obtained through 
manufacturing excellence and quality assurance. 
In maintaining customer trust, TSMC protects 
conﬁdential information concerning the Company 
and its customers while maintaining strategic 
leadership in the global patent ranking. These 
eﬀorts translate into business success, ensuring the 
freedom of TSMC's operations around the world and 
strengthening partnerships with customers.

500 invention patent applications, thus concluding 
the Groundwork Era. In 1999, the Company entered 
the Growth Era and ﬁled 1,000 patent applications 
in 2011. Starting in 2012, the IP team began setting 
patent application goals based on annual R&D 
investments, bringing TSMC into the Exponential 
Growth Era. As of 2022, TSMC has ﬁled over 
85,000 global patent applications and consistently 
reached record highs again and again. Using FinFET 

Exploratory R&D Patent Applications

technology as an example, TSMC introduced 16nm 
FinFET process technologies in 2013 and became the 
ﬁrst to fabricate both 7nm and 5nm FinFET products.

To extend the reach of green inﬂuence, TSMC further 
established the Incentive Guidelines to Encourage 
Green Trade Secret Registration and Sharing as a 
Public Service to encourage employees to publicly 
share their experience on energy conservation, 
carbon emissions reduction, energy management, 
environmental conservation, and more. Employees 
may ﬁrst register undisclosed, sustainability-related 
innovations as green trade secrets before seeking 
approval from the system for public disclosure, which 
also qualiﬁes the innovations to become candidates 
for recognition as distinguished charitable cases by 
the Company. Without compromising proprietary 
information protection policies (PIP), TSMC hopes to 
proliferate a green manufacturing culture and actual 
practices and work with the industry to promote

System Alumni Association to Extend 
Sustainability Inﬂuence across Industries

TSMC's Strategic Supply Chain Partners Trade Secret Management Sharing public service 
project strengthens trade secret management (TSM) in the supply chain and provides easy-to-
understand trade secret registration (TSR) principles and practices to suppliers. In June 2022, 
TSMC founded the Trade Secret Registration System Alumni Association to share the Company's 
TSR execution experience, standard registration templates, and reference evaluation metrics 
to help suppliers quickly pick up 
TSR. Members of the association 
also discussed challenges in TSR 
execution and exchanged respective 
solutions, which further inspired 
new TSR and TSM services. In 
2022, TSMC successfully assisted 
Solar Applied Materials Tech, 
eChem Solutions Corp., and ten 
other companies in establishing 
and implementing their own TSR 
systems. In 2023, TSMC plans to do 
the same for ﬁve more companies. 
TSMC envisions itself as the 
advocate for TSR and intelligent

quality control platform, using AI technology to 
simultaneously compare over thirty quality defense 

systems, set the same speciﬁcation control, and 
optimize global wafer production quality by 
benchmarking against equipment with the best 
wafer process performance. For Maximum Tool 
Productivity, TSMC utilizes an intelligent operation 
platform to process abnormal activities from millions 
of process control charts, allowing engineers to 
detect abnormal activities at the same time. They can 
then use TSMC's intelligent diagnostics platform to 
quickly ﬁnd the root cause and promptly repair tools. 
For Optimizing People Eﬃciency, TSMC rolled out 
relevant measures in 2022 to all TSMC fabs around 
the world, continuing to digitalize knowledge from 
internal experts and utilizing intelligent workﬂows to

Improve Quality Capability

Quality capability plays a key role in ensuring 
technology leadership. TSMC's Quality and Reliability 
Laboratories have been dedicated to perfecting, 
researching, and developing testing methods. In 
2022, the laboratories introduced 272 innovative 
testing methods while ensuring that device 
characteristics, process yield, and product reliability 
all comply with customer demands and standards. 
From device, packaging to system level, TSMC 

continues to minimize quality risks in customer 
products and maintains strict monitoring of raw 
material stability and safety acquired from the 
upstream or through recycling, aiming to realize the 
Company's vision of being a green, safe, and healthy 
workplace. As EUV is critical to advanced processes, a 
new aging test method for EUV mask was developed 
to accelerate validation and technology development 
with 1/5000 of the electricity consumption compared 

to the original method, fulﬁlling the Company's 
commitment to sustainable operation.

In addition to strengthening quality capabilities 
and management throughout the supply chain, 
TSMC is also dedicated to talent cultivation and 
local industry support. In 2022, TSMC launched 
industry-academia cooperative research programs 
with Harvard University and National Cheng Kung 

University to stabilize production line quality by 
exchanging knowledge on mechanics and working 
together to overcome problems with product failure 
and reliability. Meanwhile, TSMC collaborated with the 
Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International 
(SEMI) to organize the fourth Strategic Materials 
Conference in Taiwan, sharing the win-win strategy for 
technology and sustainable development to elevate 
the competitiveness of the local supply chain.

Enhance Sustainable Chemicals Management

TSMC cares about the safety of its employees and 
supply chain. To continue tracking where materials 
with potential risks end up, TSMC's Advanced Materials 
Analytical Center (AMAC) has established mechanisms 
for screening CMR materials and expands its screening 
scope based on the Company's technology roadmap. 
In 2022, the AMAC completed the screening of new 
16 semiconductor materials, developing the ability 
to analyze 100% of CMR substances. Furthermore, 
TSMC assisted VisEra in strengthening protection 
for high-risk materials by sharing measures such as 
substitutes for high-risk chemicals, protection gear, 
and regular workplace assessments. Meanwhile, TSMC 
incorporated hazardous substance management 
regulations in the TSMC Supplier Sustainability 
Standards, and provided training, auditing, and 
guidance to suppliers. In 2022, TSMC continued to help 
all suppliers supplying materials with potential risks to 
develop capabilities to detect CMR substances.

In compliance with the TSMC Environmental Policy and 
TSMC Safety and Health Policy, TSMC is committed to 
becoming a world-class company in environmental 
protection, health, and safety. Sustainable chemicals 
management at TSMC includes compliance with 
international regulations and customer requirements. 
In addition, the Company has always aimed to avoid 
or minimize the use of hazardous substances. The 
Corporate Environment, Safety and Health (ESH) 
Division and the Industrial Safety and Environmental 
Protection Departments of the fabs are responsible 
for ensuring that the storage, transport, use, and 
disposal of any irreplaceable hazardous materials are 
compliant with regulations as well as TSMC's own ESH 
requirements to guarantee the health and safety of 
all workers and prevent pollution to the environment. 

Such materials can only be used with consent from VP-
level executives of related divisions or departments.

NMPs are commonly used in industrial and 
semiconductor processes. However, due to their 
reproductive toxicity, TSMC launched an industry-ﬁrst 
replacement program in 2016. In 2022, TSMC was 
able to achieve the goal of reducing NMP usage at 
all Taiwan facilities by 95%. The Company expects to 
replace all NMP use at overseas locations by the end 
of 2023. NMP replacement is an innovative practice 
and, therefore, subject to rigorous internal review. After 
years of hard work across multiple facilities, TSMC is 
able to conﬁrm that NMP replacement not only meets 
product quality demands but is also more friendly to 
the environment.

In addition, TSMC uses green procurement 
procedures to control chemical sources and ensure 
new materials are free from hazardous substances. 
New materials or changes to existing materials both 
require conﬁrmation through the green procurement 
process to avoid any hazardous substances prohibited 
or restricted by regulations or customers. In 2022, 
to strengthen PFAS management, TSMC amended 
green procurement procedures, expanding the list of 
prohibited substances from PFASs with eight or more 
carbons to PFASs with more than four carbons, taking 
control from the source.

Sustainable chemicals management at TSMC is based 
on the QC 080000 Hazardous Substance Process 
Management System Requirements and strives for 
continuous improvements by utilizing the plan-do-check-
act (PDCA) management model. All the TSMC fabs, upon 
oﬃcial launch, acquire third-party certiﬁcation.

TSMC Quality and Reliability Laboratories strive to innovate in testing methods to support technology development

the early stages of volume production using 5nm 
process technologies. The Company has helped 
customers design and plan automotive chips 
with HPC capabilities beforehand and will be 
updating design principles as more experience 
with the volume production of 5nm technologies 
is acquired. In 2022, TSMC completed veriﬁcation 
of automotive IPs for TSMC's 5nm technology, 
perfectly addressing customer design requirement 
for auto chips.

For quality in manufacturing, TSMC has been 
able to strengthen the application of design 
principles for automotive products by timely 
physical failure analysis for process improvement. 
In 2022, TSMC completed reliability veriﬁcation 
for 5nm automotive processes and met 

customers' requirements for the defective parts 
per million (DPPM) of new designs. This helps 
improve and facilitate volume production for 
subsequent designs, testing, and processes. 
To realize intelligent precision manufacturing, 
TSMC leveraged machine learning to create an 
automatic yield monitoring system and deployed 
the system to all facilities in 2022. The system has 
been able to stabilize product yield and return 
problems immediately. Moreover, the Quality 
and Reliability Organization completed several 
digital transformation projects in the areas of raw 
materials management, statistical process control 
(SPC), metrology and laboratory analysis, which 
has enabled smart quality defense and remote 
management of manufacturing, making seamless 
quality control across all TSMC fabs around the 
world a reality.

For quality in services, as advanced processes 
become more complex, TSMC introduced 
innovative Design-Technology Co-Optimization 
(DTCO) to enhance the speed, power and density 
of TSMC's new process technologies. TSMC has 
also launched new process standardization 
training programs to familiarize customers 
with new process design processes, which can 
help accelerate new product design timelines 
and volume production. For example, the most 
advanced training program is currently on N3E, 
which was launched in November 2022. As of  
December 2022, a total of 10 clients with 11 
training sessions and a total of 1,200 individuals 
have participated in the N3E course for the next 
generation of semiconductor innovation. In 
addition, to reduce product defects and risks of 
product returns, TSMC oﬀers diverse courses to 
customers, sharing technical knowledges on high-

voltage stress, burn-in, and screening. In 2022, 
TSMC shared quality-related information with

reliability testing to ensure stable production lines 
and strengthen partnerships.

Thanks to qualiﬁcation in technology development, 
real-time defense systems and innovative 
applications in semiconductor manufacturing 
services, as well as its continuous quality 
improvement culture, TSMC had no major product 
recalls in 2022. Meanwhile, a third-party audit 
veriﬁed the eﬀectiveness of the Company's 
quality management systems in compliance with 
IATF 16949:2016 and IECQ QC 080000:2017 
requirements. In 2022, TSMC's four backend fabs 
also continued to pass the certiﬁcation of the

Customer feedback and satisfaction ratings are 
opportunities for TSMC to improve. The customer 
service team learns and analyzes customers' 
commercial and technological demands through 
annual satisfaction surveys, quarterly evaluation 
meetings, and need-based meetings to provide 
optimal solutions to strengthen partnerships. In

survey with more than 200 customers and held over 
100 quarterly evaluation meetings with more than 
30 customers, hosting more than 1,200 online and 
oﬄine meetings for the managerial level.

In 2022, the global semiconductor market 
experienced extreme changes: from strong demands 
in the ﬁrst half of the year to decelerated growth in 
the second half. With uncertainties looming over 
the industry, TSMC decided to double down on 
collaboration and communication with customers. In 
2022, customer satisfaction levels have rebounded 
from 84% in 2021 to 88%. In the future, TSMC will 
continue to work on long-term capacity planning, 
tech support, and other areas. The Company hopes 
that the newly added capacity and the distribution 
of existing capacity can satisfy customer demands, 
provide greater supply chain resilience, and 
ultimately, help TSMC achieve its long-term goal 
of 90% customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, TSMC is 
proud to announce that customer trust, an indicator 
from the annual customer satisfaction survey, has 
already increased to 95%. TSMC is also advancing 
manufacturing technologies to achieve better quality 
and yield. In 2022, cases of problematic engineering 

quality or poor reliability for every one million 12-inch 
wafers shipped were reduced to 36% of the level in 

2019, exceeding the annual goal of 55%. As such, the 
Company decided to ramp up the 2030 Goal to 20%.

Improvement Measures for 
Sustainability Management

TSMC worked closely with supplier partners through 
the four guiding principles of Compliance Guidance, 
Risk Assessment, Audit Participation, and Continuous 
Improvement to urge suppliers to improve their 
sustainability performance and take the initiative 
to promote sustainable practices to their upstream 
suppliers. To prompt common growth among 
supplier partners worldwide, TSMC established 
the global responsible supply chain management 
platform Supply Online 360. The platform serves as an 
integrated communication channel with all suppliers, 
propelling tangible change with virtual data analysis 
and bringing sustainable semiconductor supply chain 
practices into reality.

Conduct a preliminary assessment by 
examining the category and origin of 
all products based on the business 
relations TSMC has with the suppliers 
to analyze potential risks

Deﬁne the Supplier Risk Matrix and 
the grading management measures 
according to the Tier 1 suppliers' SAQ 
results, resilience of the supply chain, 
and trading amount

For critical high-risk suppliers in the 
Matrix whose management is more 
urgent, TSMC conducts on-site audits 
to identify the actual risk status and 
provides constant consultation to 
reduce risks

● Compliance Guidance 

As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance 
(RBA), TSMC has established its Supplier Code of 
Conduct according to RBA's Code of Conduct. TSMC 
requires Tier 1 suppliers to comply with the Code of 
Conduct while encouraging them to ask their upstream 
suppliers, contractors, and service providers to adopt 
the same Code in their practices and management. 
New suppliers must sign the TSMC Supplier Code of 
Conduct to be eligible for partnership.

● Risk Assessment

To gain an in-depth understanding of the 
current status of supply chain development and 
potential risks, TSMC conducts a three-phase risk 
assessment in supplier management, identifying 

the improvement measures required for suppliers 
according to supplier classiﬁcation.

First, TSMC investigates and analyzes all suppliers it 
conducts business with and requires Tier 1 suppliers 
to conduct the Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) to 
evaluate their performance in sustainability. In 2022, Tier 
1 suppliers in Taiwan completed 1,230 SAQs. According 
to the survey results, for the Dangerous Workplace 
category, the most common problem among 4% of the 
suppliers was failure to stipulate operating procedures 
for dangerous machines; in terms of Personnel 
Operation Safety, 3% of suppliers did not have 
adequately equipped emergency response personnel, 
and they did not formulate eﬀective ﬁrst aid procedures; 
regarding Fire Protection Equipment Design and 
Maintenance, 16% of the suppliers had not established 

a monthly ﬁre protection equipment inspection and 
maintenance plan. TSMC determines the level of risk 
based on the SAQ results and priority accident records, 
and it deﬁnes supplier grades according to indicators 
such as procurement expenses, product criticality, and 
business relations with TSMC. Using the two dimensions 
of Risk and Criticality, TSMC establishes a Supplier 
Risk Matrix to deﬁne supplier grades and formulate 
exclusive management measures accordingly. In 2022, 
suppliers with physical production lines were targeted 
for management. Besides the existing SAQ items, two 
assessment items, Supply Chain Risk Management and 
Process Reliability, were added, while climate change 
response measures, ﬁre protection system integrity, and 
green manufacturing were also considered. Suppliers 
scoring less than 70 points were included as the priority 
inspection targets of on-site audits.

● Audit Implementation  and Continuous 

Improvement

S.H.A.R.P.

After identifying risks using the Supplier Risk Matrix, TSMC conducts 
on-site or remote audits focusing on the six major categories of 
Supply Chain Risk, Quality and Reliability, Environmental Safety and 
Health, Fire Protection System, Labor Ethics, and Management 
System to determine potential risks and opportunities. TSMC 
requires suppliers to propose improvement plans and schedules 
and assigns the TSMC S.H.A.R.P. Team to oﬀer guidance and follow-
up on improvements regularly. The Company has further extended 
audit projects such as key guidance and new factory design 
guidance, and constantly strengthens suppliers' self-management 
awareness and improvement ability. In 2022, TSMC conducted 160 
on-site audits of critical high-risk suppliers to properly track the risk 
status of the suppliers and improve their operational sustainability. 
By doing so, TSMC can ensure stable materials supply and services, 
provide a safe and healthy workplace, and minimize environmental 
and social impact.

Re-audit and  Key items improved Projects

To ensure suppliers' improvement results, the 
TSMC S.H.A.R.P. Team focused on four major 
dimensions of the six major categories, Supply 
Chain Risks, Quality and Reliability, Environmental 
Safety and Health, and Fire Protection System, to 
launch short, medium, and long-term improvement 
plans to  solve the problems from previous audits. 
Furthermore, a key items improved  project was 
implemented and suppliers were required to 
formulate a business Continuity Plan (BCP) and 
conduct regular drills, and formulate contingency 
measures to minimize the potential risks of

Procurement Arrangement of Main 
Raw Materials

TSMC has formulated comprehensive procurement 
management actions for main materials, and it 
continues to collaborate with suppliers in ﬁve major 
areas: supplier distribution, diverse sources of 
materials, quality control, local procurement, and 
sustainable operations. By adjusting the global 
market deployment, developing diverse sources of 
materials, and increasing localized procurement, 
potential supply chain risks such as insuﬃcient 
production capacity, quality defects, delivery 
delays, inﬂation, and major natural disasters can 
be proactively resolved. Furthermore, suppliers 
are required to incorporate sustainability into their 
operational considerations in accordance with the 
TSMC Supplier Sustainability Standard. At the same 

time, TSMC also collaborates with suppliers to 
facilitate advanced material R&D, process innovation, 
and quality improvement, thereby continuously 
improving supply chain resilience and generating the 
values of a circular economy. For more information, 
please refer to 5.3.5 Raw Material and Supply Chain 
Management in the annual report.

Suppliers' Reporting Procedure
TSMC values people above all else and has established 
a Supply Chain Employee Grievance Channel on Supply 
Online 360. This reporting channel oﬀers protection 
for the employees of suppliers, extends and deepens 
TSMC's management practices, and builds a more 
inclusive workplace for the supply chain. In 2022, there 
were ﬁve reported cases, of which two were erroneous 
claims; one was a remuneration-related dispute and

Responsible Minerals Sourcing

TSMC ensures that human rights, health, and the 
environment in mineral production areas are not 
violated by purchasing conﬂict-free raw materials 
from dependable sources. In light of this, the 
Company has adopted a series of legal compliance 
measures including the establishment of a due 
diligence framework following the Model Supply 
Chain Policy for a Responsible Global Supply Chain 
of Mineral from Conﬂict-Aﬀected and High-Risk 
Areas published by the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD). At the same 
time, TSMC is one of the staunchest supporters of 

the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and Global 
e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). The Company 
adheres to the Responsible Minerals Assurance 
Process (RMAP), requiring suppliers to procure 
conﬂict-free raw materials.

TSMC requires suppliers to comply with the 
responsible minerals sourcing policy and sign the 
statement of responsible minerals for products 
containing tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold. Since 
2017, TSMC has also disclosed the source smelters 

for the cobalt used in TSMC products to clients. 
In 2022, the Company completed the inventory of 
mica usage in the supply chain. Since 2021, TSMC 
has audited at least three suppliers of tantalum, 
tin, tungsten, and gold annually, ensuring that 
these suppliers formulate and implement conﬂict-
free minerals management processes and conduct 
due diligence on upstream suppliers. For the latest 
TSMC disclosure documents, please visit TSMC's 
oﬃcial website or the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission website.

Strengthen Supply Chain Resilience

TSMC ensures ESH sustainability management 
in the supply chain with four separate steps: 
Establishing Standards and Systems, Audit and 
Violations Tracking, Consultation and Training, 
and Focus Consultation. To constantly improve 
the sustainability of suppliers, besides regularly 
organizing the Sustainable Supply Environment, 
Safety, and Health Forum, practical ﬁre protection 
equipment training, emergency response drills 
and observation, and on-site energy conservation 
and carbon reduction diagnosis and guidance, 
the Company also launched a series of courses 

and training including ESH and Fire Response 
Workshop, Supplier Fire  Protection Autonomous 
Training, Supplier Carbon Inventory Workshop, 
and Supplier Product Carbon Footprint 
Inventory Workshop in 2022. Through hands-
on teaching, group discussion, and practice by 
professional lecturers, the learning performance 
and self-management capabilities of suppliers 
are optimized, thereby enhancing suppliers' 
environmental safety, health, and loss prevention

Further Improvement of 

TSMC implemented the Supplier Sustainable Fire Protection Management Mechanism in 2020 and 
established a Supplier Protection Personnel System in 2021 to allocate training resources to executive 
personnel in order to achieve optimal training performance. In 2022, to lower the risk of material 
supply interruptions caused by ﬁres, TSMC launched the Supplier Fire Protection Personnel Project 
2.0 in addition to introducing ﬁre protection requirements that are superior to RBA speciﬁcations; 
the Company also conducted on-site measurements and random inspections of supplier production 

lines. Based on the principle of the Supplier Sustainability Standards, TSMC collaborated with external 
experts to open small classes for practical ﬁre protection-related operational training and implemented 
the Supplier Fire Protection Autonomous Training Program. Meanwhile, online interactive courses will 
be planned and made available in the TSMC Supplier Sustainability Academy in 2023, so that suppliers' 
ﬁre protection training will not be subject to time and venue constraints, thereby reﬁning ﬁre protection 
management and equipment reliability on an ongoing basis.

Supplier Fire Protection Practice and Operational Training
Commissioned WuFeng University to organize the Practical Operational Training for 
Supplier Fire Protection Personnel, using MR equipment to conduct on-site drills in a 
bid to improve suppliers' professional ﬁre protection capabilities. A total of 40 supplier 
representatives participated in two training sessions.

Supplier Fire Protection Autonomous Training Program
Fire protection technicians hired by suppliers were asked to conduct on-site training 
on employee ﬁre protection equipment. Moreover, TSMC's ﬁre protection experts 
conducted on-site guidance and observation to verify training quality. A total of 12 
suppliers have completed the training.

TSMC Supplier Sustainability Academy Interactive Fire 
Protection Course
Apart from physical courses, TSMC expects to launch the Deﬁciencies in Suppliers' Fire 
Protection Audits and Improvement Measures online course in Chinese and English on Supply 
Online 360, allowing domestic and foreign suppliers to participate in interactive ﬁre protection

Promote Green and Low-carbon 
Supply Chains

Continue to Reduce Environmental 
Impact

In response to the Net Zero by 2050 target, TSMC 
formed the Green Supply Chain  Management 
Team and proposed speciﬁc action guidelines 
based on the ﬁve major dimensions proposed by 
World Economic Forum's (WEF) Net-Zero Challenge: 
The Supply Chain Opportunity guideline: Create 
Transparency, Optimize for CO2, Engage Suppliers, 
Push Ecosystems, and Enable Your Organization. 
Through this, TSMC continues to bolster the 
operational capability of a low-carbon supply chain.

● Create Transparency

In 2022, TSMC required 137 raw material and 
equipment suppliers to participate in the CDP 
Supply Chain Program and carried out an 
organizational GHG inventory training and CDP 
disclosure questionnaire brieﬁng to improve 
data quality. A total of 322 people participated 
in the training and 111 suppliers completed the 
questionnaire. According to the survey results, 
84% of the manufacturers have put their Board of 
Directors in charge of supervising climate change 
topics, 93% have conducted GHG inventory or 
estimation, 71% have set emission reduction 
targets, and approximately 51% of suppliers have 
provided Scope 3 emissions data. Also, to improve 
carbon emission data quality, TSMC has required 
suppliers with annual GHG emissions exceeding 
2,500 tons to obtain third-party certiﬁcation for 
ISO 14064 GHG inventory since 2021. The Supplier 
Sustainability Standard is expected to be revised 
in 2023, adding Scope 3 inventory request for 
suppliers, and requiring designated suppliers 
to obtain third-party ISO 14067 product carbon 

footprint and ISO 50001 energy management 
certiﬁcation.

In 2022, to manage the raw materials supply chain 
and identify carbon emission hotspots, a life cycle 
assessment of raw materials' carbon footprint  was 
conducted. The results indicated that chemicals, 
bulk gases, and silicon wafers were the main 
emission sources.  Thus, TSMC required relevant 
suppliers  to stipulate rigorous short, medium, and 
long-term energy conservation, carbon reduction, 
and green energy consumption targets, as well as 
continue to track implementation performance. 
The Company also required suppliers to obtain 
the carbon footprint of their upstream materials 

and communicate their carbon reduction claims. 
In 2023, TSMC will consolidate supplier carbon 
information-related inventories as the basis for 
subsequent Net Zero actions.

● Optimize for CO2

TSMC continues to bolster green manufacturing. 
By improving raw materials usage eﬃciency and 
decreasing the amount of raw materials required 
for wafer production, it is able to reduce the carbon 
emissions in the supply chain. In 2022, TSMC lowered 
the consumption of bulk chemicals with a signiﬁcant 
proportion of carbon emissions to save roughly 
178,000 tons of carbon emissions at the raw materials 

manufacturing end via approaches such as reducing 
time span, extending use, replacing, and skipping 
stations. Meanwhile, the Company continues to 
promote the Electronic-grade Chemicals Recycling 
Program, indirectly decreasing carbon emissions and 
environmental impact during the upstream natural 
resource extraction process by using recycled chemicals 
in factories. Furthermore, the Company continues to 
optimize procurement strategies to minimize transport 
carbon emissions in the supply chain.

● Engage Suppliers

In 2021, TSMC stipulated the Supplier Sustainability 
Standard, requiring suppliers to formulate their GHG

reduction targets and reduce, track, document, and 
disclose their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. In 2022, 
TSMC continued to require and assist suppliers to 
improve their performance in making the supply chain 
greener. The annual total energy reduction reached 
190 GWh, and the accumulative total reached 530 
GWh. The annual total water reduction reached 9.37 
million metric tons, and the cumulative total reached 
29.08 million metric tons. Additionally, 65% of the high 
energy consumption suppliers received ISO 14064 
veriﬁcation. TSMC also required suppliers to introduce 
energy conservation assessments when building 
new factories. The waste production per unit among 
major waste-producing suppliers was reduced by 34%, 
exceeding the annual target of 32%.

Additionally, TSMC also  actively promotes green 
innovation projects in the supply chain. In 2022, 
suppliers were engaged to launch the Supplier 
Carbon Capture Program to help them build carbon 
capture equipment for rectiﬁcation columns, and 
reintroduce the residual gas from the rectiﬁcation 
process of industrial-grade liquid CO2 into the process 
for secondary puriﬁcation. This is reproduced into 
electronic-grade liquid CO2 that conforms to TSMC's 
quality standards. Up until December 2022, 800 metric 
tons of CO2 have been captured successfully.

● Push Low-carbon Ecosystems and 

Establish Internal Carbon Reduction 
Mechanisms

TSMC is dedicated to creating a green semiconductor 
supply chain. Besides working with suppliers to 
advance the Energy Conservation Action Project for 
Next-generation Fab Tools, suppliers with high carbon 
emissions were invited to join the renewable energy 
joint procurement project in 2022 to assist suppliers to 
expand the source of green power procurement and 
consolidate the upstream to form a low-carbon supply 
chain. In 2022, TSMC established a green supply chain 
management team to track and require suppliers to 
implement carbon reduction actions. The team is also 
responsible for integrating TSMC's internal and external 
resources to help suppliers achieve their targets. 
Moreover, in response to TSMC's internal application of 
ESG AWARD to motivate employees to constantly review 
carbon reduction opportunities and inspire green 
innovation, the Materials Management invited suppliers 
to submit proposals together for the ﬁrst time in 2022, 
such as collaborating with suppliers to recycle packaging 
materials or recycling and transforming calcium ﬂuoride 
sludge into recycled products, as well as enhancing 
carbon reduction awareness among TSMC personnel 
and the supply chain through a reward mechanism.

Supplier Material Packaging White Paper Regulations Launched to Form 
Optimal Packaging Supply Chain

To alleviate the environmental problems 
caused by excessive packaging of raw 
materials, TSMC and suppliers joined forces to 
compile the first Supplier Material Packaging 
White Paper Regulations to promote reduction 
circulation in the three major dimensions of 
Health and Safety, Environmental Protection, 
and Packaging and Labeling Standardization 
to establish a Handling-friendly, Environment-
friendly, and Automation-friendly packaging 
culture. More than 1,200 domestic and foreign 
raw materials suppliers were encouraged to 
improve packaging operations, striving towards 
the goal of optimal packaging in the supply 
chain.

In 2022, TSMC took the initiative to provide 
packaging samples for suppliers of similar 
materials through inventory checks, oﬀering 
improvement suggestions to elevate packaging 
quality. Additionally, active promotion was 
conducted through the Supply Online 360 platform 
to encourage suppliers to implement packaging 
optimization from the manufacturing end to the 
logistics process. Please refer to Supplier Material 
Packaging White Paper Regulations  for further 
details.

Power to Change Society

Responding to climate change is the responsibility for 
sustainable business operation. As the world's largest 
provider of semiconductor technologies and capacity, 
TSMC is committed to reaching Net Zero emissions 
by 2050 and has drawn Roadmap to Net Zero 
Emissions, targets include zero-growth and gradual 
reduction in carbon emissions starting 2025, reducing 
2030 carbon emission to 2010 levels, and reaching 
net zero emissions (with value chain included) by 
2050. Among these, using 100% renewable energy 
is one of the key strategies in realizing net zero 
emissions. Other than the continuing improvements 

of various carbon reduction actions, TSMC is 
also working on expanding the use of renewable 
energy and establishing a diverse supply. Since the 
Company included a small-scale hydroelectric station 
as one of the sources of power supply in 2022, its 
yearly use of renewable energy reached 2,190 GWh, 
and TSMC overseas sites reached net zero emissions 
in Scope 1 and 2. TSMC established carbon credits 
quality procurement standards for the ﬁrst time in 
2022 and chose four carbon credits oﬀset programs 
for carbon reduction, and referenced the UN's 
Convention on Biological Diversity and SDGs as 

guidelines to formulate its Biodiversity Statement. 
Oﬃcially launched in 2023, the Statement strives 
to reach a balance between technology and the 
ecosystem to allow never-ending momentum for 
sustainability to realize GHG reduction targets.

Strengthen Climate Resilience

Global Risks Report 2023 published by the World 
Economic Forum (WEF) pointed out that climate-
related environmental issues are the most signiﬁcant 
four risks of the top ten global risks over the 
next decade, including failure to mitigate climate 

change, failure of climate-change adaptation, 
natural disasters and extreme weather events, 
and biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; 
it is clear that constantly improving climate risk 
response measures and enhancing corporate 
operational resilience are pressing important 
tasks. TSMC successfully achieved uninterrupted 
production target in 2022 by identifying potential 
risks and opportunities through regular systematic 
risk assessment identiﬁcation and following the 
Company's Climate Risk Adaptation Standards to 
reduce potential climate disaster.

Note: Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) is an international initiative organization that encourages companies to set an absolute GHG emission reduction target that is in line with the Paris Agreement goals with a yearly reduction of 4.2 %. TSMC is committed to develop SBT reduction targets in 2017, and as 
the global demand for chips drastically increased in recent years, the CAGR of TSMC's capacity exceeds 10%. However, as the supply from the renewable energy market in the Company's main manufacturing site was insuﬃcient, reaching SBT requirements poses as a challenge in the short term. Taking 
operational growth and development trends in carbon reduction into account, TSMC will put zero growth in emissions as the main target, and assess to fulﬁll SBT requirements in mid and long-term targets

TSMC holds the Climate Change Risk and 
Opportunity Workshop once every two years to 
identify and update climate risks and opportunities 
based on the Recommendations of the Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
framework. In 2022, the Workshop identiﬁed 11 
transition and physical climate risks and eight 
opportunities. The top three climate risks were net 
zero emissions, impact on company reputation, 
and uncertainties in the development of new 
energy saving/carbon reduction technologies, 
and the top three opportunities were: develop 
low-carbon products and services and increase 
energy eﬃciency in customer products, drive 
low carbon manufacturing, and boost company 
reputation. Apart from continuous improvements 
on carbon reduction practices, TSMC also set up 
carbon credit procurement strategies and started 
implementations in 2022 to further enhance 
corporate climate resilience. See TSMC TCFD

The annual GHG inventory result is TSMC's ﬁrst step 
to strengthening carbon reduction by reviewing 
overall carbon reduction eﬀorts and revising the 
emission reduction strategies on a rolling basis. In 
2022, the Company's total GHG emission was 18 
million MT CO2 equivalent; direct emissions from 
Scope 1 processes such as F-GHGs and nitrous oxide 
processes accounted for 11%; indirect GHG emissions 
in Scope 2 from electricity use, which was still the major 
emission source, accounted for 50%; and indirect GHG 
emissions from the value chain in Scope 3 accounted 
for 39%, which were primarily from producing raw 
materials, energy related activities in the upstream, 
and transportation. Overall GHG emissions increased 

Roadmap to Net Zero Emissions

14% compared to the previous year because of the 
continuous expansion of advanced process capacities, 
however, in terms of the capacity growth ratio, per unit 
product emissions saw a slight decrease compared to 
the previous year, indicating TSMC's non-stop eﬀorts 
in improving low-carbon manufacturing actions that 
eﬀectively delivered GHG emissions reduction per unit 
product.

TSMC continues to enforce industry-leading best 
practices for GHG reduction, including ramping up 
replacements and installing local scrubbers on the 
manufacturing end, using carbon-neutral natural 
gases, constructing green factories with green building 

certiﬁcates, implementing energy-saving projects for 
process tools and facility equipment, and increasing the 
use of renewable energy. In response to an increase 
in carbon cost brought about by a global trend in low-
carbon transition, starting from 2022, TSMC widely 
uses internal carbon pricing mechanism to reﬂect 
carbon cost in eﬃcacy estimation for daily reduction 
measures, and include this into decision-making 
evaluation for new fab investments. As for emissions 
reduction actions in Scope 3, TSMC continues to focus 
on increasing material use eﬃciency and implement 
electronic grade chemical reuse. Starting from 2022, 
TSMC invites suppliers to participate in the CDP Supply 
Chain Program to learn more about the global trend

Use Renewable Energy  

TSMC Renewable Energy Development Timeline

Increasing the use of renewable energy is critical 
to achieving the Company's goal of Net Zero 
Emissions by 2050. In 2022, with support from the 
board and management team, TSMC introduced 
renewable energy from small hydroelectric 
stations, continued to increase power supply from 
onshore wind farms, increased renewable energy 
usage by 47% to 970 GWh, and maintained 100% 
use of renewable energy in global oﬃces. TSMC 
also signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) 
for 1.3 GW of renewable energy with the option to 
increase around 3,900 GWh of green energy each 
year. By the end of 2022, the Company has signed 
on 2.9 GW of renewable energy through PPAs, 
which can reduce around 4.6 million metric tons of 
carbon emissions each year.

In addition, TSMC has been purchasing renewable 
energy, Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates (RECs), and 
carbon credits in countries with comprehensive 
regulations and ample supply to oﬀset 100% of 
carbon emissions from power used in overseas 
locations, including the United States, Canada, 
Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. 2022 marks the 
ﬁfth consecutive year that TSMC has achieved zero 
carbon emissions from power consumption in 
overseas subsidiaries.

Renewable Energy Systems

In addition to purchasing renewable energy, TSMC 
has also installed solar panels in TSMC facilities to 
produce carbon-free renewable energy for its own 
fabs. In 2022, TSMC had an installed capacity of 5,340 
kWp in solar panels, which provided 4.56 GWh in 
electricity and reduced carbon emissions by 2,322 
metric tons. In 2023, an additional 900 kW of solar 
panel capacity will be installed, which can generate 
up to 4.6 GWh of electricity. While strengthening 
its own climate resilience, the Company is also 

expanding the scope of eﬀorts toward sustainability 
and common good through TSMC Charity 
Foundation's Public Welfare Green Energy Project 
to install photovoltaic (PV) systems and give back 
all earnings from power rebates to organizations 
serving disadvantaged communities. As of 2022, the 
Company has provided an installed capacity of 464 
kWp across seven locations and generated 574,000 
kWh in electricity. In 2022, it also gave back NT$2.75 
million from rebates generated by the project.

Taiwan facilities in energy conservation to generate 
more green beneﬁts.

In 2022, TSMC implemented 684 energy 
conservation measures across eight categories, 
achieving a 13% energy saving rate and conserving 
700 GWh in electricity. Energy conserved in 2022 
is the equivalent of reducing 360,000 metric tons 
in carbon emissions and saving NT$1.75 billion in 
energy costs. The reduced carbon emissions also 
decreased the potential social cost of carbon by 
NT$530 million. As of 2022, the Energy Conservation 
Action Project for Next-generation Fab Tools 
launched in 2018 has validated and applied 195 
energy-conservation programs to hundreds types 
of advanced process tools and conserved 500 
GWh in energy through cross-fab roll out of energy 
conservation measures.

Strengthen Biodiversity Protection

TSMC cares about environmental sustainability and 
actively works to strike a balance between technology 
and ecology. To ensure sustainable ecosystems 
and maintain biodiversity, TSMC regularly assesses 
changes in ecosystems surrounding TSMC fabs, 
cultivates indigenous species, created ﬁreﬂy habitats 
within TSMC locations, and launched the TSMC 
Plant a Tree Program to facilitate stable population 
growth and reproduction for species. In addition to 
implementing eco-friendly practices, TSMC is also an 
avid supporter of the UN Convention on Biological 
Diversity and SDGs. The Company formulated its own 

Biodiversity Milestones at TSMC

Biodiversity Statement in 2022, which will be formally 
declared in 2023. TSMC's Biodiversity Statement will 
commit to working with stakeholders to protect and 
deepen the integrity of biodiversity and working with 
supply chain partners to raise awareness and comply 
with related regulations within business locations, 
fulﬁlling its mission of strengthening environmental 
protection.

In 2022 Q4, TSMC conducted a Dependencies & 
Impacts on Nature and Biodiversity Assessment for 
deeper insights into interactions between operations 

and local environments, analyzing three areas - 
location of facilities, emission of pollutants, and 
dependency on ecosystem services. For location of 
facilities, TSMC overlapped the Company's locations 
in Taiwan with the Forestry's Bureau National 
Ecological Network GIS database and included 
resources consumed and emissions discharged 
throughout operations as assessment factors to 
identify mitigation and restoration. Results showed 
that there are no wildlife refuges or nature reserves 
within two kilometers of TSMC locations in Taiwan,

In addition, TSMC is working with stakeholders such 
as the Forestry Bureau, county and city governments, 
research and education institutes, and conservation 
groups to promote conservation programs based 
on conservation corridor assessment results and 
deepen the diverse values of biodiversity.

For pollutant emissions, TSMC used qualitative 
analysis of Life Cycle Impact and identiﬁed 
GHG emissions as the main cause of impact on 
biodiversity, followed by water consumption. TSMC 
is driving low-carbon manufacturing and enforcing 
GHG reduction standard practices to eﬀectively 
reduce GHG emissions per unit of production. The 
Company also complies with AWS Standards to 
enforce sustainable water management at all TSMC 
fabs and improves surrounding ecosystems and 
soil and water conservation to foster biodiversity. 
For dependency on ecosystem services, which was 
explored for the ﬁrst time in 2022, TSMC established 
a dedicated internal unit and invited outside 
experts to join in meetings and discussions and 
also compiled a survey on supplier enforcement. 
Results showed that TSMC and its supply chain 
are more dependent on three types of ecosystem 
services - water provision, climate regulation, and 
ﬂood prevention. TSMC will continue to strengthen 
the climate resilience, promote green and low-
carbon supply chains, and strengthen management 
in compliance with the Climate Risk Adaptation 
Standards to reduce dependency on ecosystem 
services and mitigate impact on operations from 
loss of ecosystem services.

Consistent Eﬀorts to Optimize Energy 
Eﬃciency in EUV Tools Save 60 GWh 
Electricity per Year

Three Innovations of AI-powered 
Water Chiller System Improve Energy-
eﬃciency

TSMC is committed to driving green manufacturing and actively implements energy-eﬃciency 
innovations. The Company continues to optimize the energy-saving model of water chiller 
systems through machine learning methods and successfully develops three functions including 
Single Chiller Compressor Abnormal Energy Consumption Detection, Multi-chiller Compressor 
Operating Load Precision Forecast, and Water Chiller System Pressure Control Optimization 
to strengthen operational reliability. TSMC introduced the three functions to Fab 15A in 2022, 
saving 2 GWh of electricity and reducing 1,000 metric tons of carbon emissions. In 2023, all 
TSMC 12-inch wafer fabs in Taiwan will begin to adopt the three functions, which are also listed 
as standard designs for new plants. Those initiatives are expected to save 100 GWh of electricity 
per year and reduce carbon emissions by 50,000 metric tons, bringing TSMC closer to its 2050 
sustainability goal of Net Zero Emissions.

TSMC has successfully applied EUV technologies for 3nm volume production, but energy 
consumption rises with the growing number of EUV tools. To ensure developments in process 
technologies do not compromise environmental sustainability, the Company continues to optimize 
EUV tool parameters and reduce energy consumption per unit of wafer production through 
big data analysis. Additionally, TSMC engages suppliers for research to dive deep and uncover 
opportunities to conserve more energy.

Research has shown that EUV light is transmitted with the help of unique reﬂective mirrors, which, 
after bouncing oﬀ several mirrors, result in severe energy attenuation. The multilayer mirror's 
ﬂatness and smoothness determines EUV light reﬂectivity, so, to increase energy eﬃciency, TSMC 
has engaged suppliers to ﬁnetune mirror fabrication processes and optical structures to optimize 
ﬂatness and smoothness and eﬀectively improve reﬂectivity. EUV light is produced from laser pulses 
ﬁring 50,000 times per second at a drop of 
tin. Vaporized tin often deposits on mirrors 
to cause fog, which impacts productivity. The 
Company then needs to inject hydrogen and 
tin to produce tin hydride before pulling the 
multilayer mirror out of the chamber. After 
repeated testing with suppliers, TSMC was 
able to pinpoint the optimal parameters 
for the number of pumps required for tin 
vapor removal, eﬀectively reducing energy 
consumed by tin vapor pumps. In 2022, 
TSMC was able to successfully reduce energy 
consumption per wafer from EUV tools by 
22%, the equivalent of 60 GWh.

Case Study

Establish Carbon Credits Quality Procurement Standards to Achieve Carbon 
Reduction and Sustainable Development

TSMC is committed to creating an environmentally 
and socially responsible business model. To fulﬁll the 
Company's commitment of Net Zero Emissions by 2050, 
the Corporate Environment Safety Health Division, 
Finance, Accounting, Legal, Information Technology and 
Materials Management, and Supply Chain Management 
Units formed the Carbon Credit Task Force and 
formulated the Carbon Credits Quality Standards for 
Voluntary Emissions Reductions in compliance with 
international guidelines and industry practices to serve 
as purchasing guidelines. TSMC assessed carbon 
credit veriﬁcation standards, year issued, additionality, 
permanence, and risk management. Additionally, the 
Company prioritizes programs that comply with UN 
SDGs such as Climate, Community & Biodiversity (CCB) 
and the criteria that the source of carbon credits should 
align with emissions for rigorous quality assurance to 
extend the scope of TSMC's sustainability impact.

TSMC's overseas locations currently use 100% renewable 

Four Nature-based Carbon Credit Programs

energy and exhaust gas reduction facilities to maximize 
emissions reduction. The remaining carbon emissions 
are oﬀset, in principle, with carbon credits. In 2022, 
TSMC selected four carbon credit programs located 
in the U.S. and China that comply with the Company's 
Carbon Credits Quality Standards for Voluntary 
Emissions Reductions. The programs are mainly nature-
based carbon credits from projects that establish 
natural forests and improve forest management. Two of 
the natural forest establishment programs create jobs 
for local residents and foster skillsets in maintaining the 
forest; 50% of the jobs created are oﬀered to women to 
facilitate gender equality. The remaining two programs 
improve forest management to uphold local biodiversity 
and help local conservation groups and indigenous 
communities preserve traditional cultures and outdoor 
education through earnings from carbon credits. 
Through carbon credit trading, TSMC has been able to 
not only oﬀset carbon emissions but also fulﬁll several 
SDGs to create diverse sustainability beneﬁts.

In 2022, Taiwan experienced zero typhoons while 
weather fronts carrying moisture failed to cover 
reservoirs in Taiwan, resulting in little rainfall in 
Southern Taiwan. Based on the drought monitoring 
signals issued by the Water Resources Agency, TSMC 
adopted response measures in compliance with the 
TSMC Internal Control Procedures for Low Water 
Supply Crisis Management to take stock of areas where 
more water could be conserved and to strengthen 
the water use eﬃciency of recycling systems. In 2022, 
the Company conserved 3.35 million m3 of water and 
recycled a cumulative total of 215 million m3 of water 
throughout the year.

While working to increase water reclamation eﬃciency, 
TSMC also cares about getting the most use out of 
every drop of water. As such, TSMC is actively developing 
water reclamation technologies. On September 
19, 2022, the TSMC Tainan Science Park Reclaimed 
Water Plant
Taiwan's ﬁrst privately-operated water 
reclamation plant
became operational and started 
recycling industrial wastewater produced in the 
Southern Taiwan Science Park into reclaimed water 
for advanced semiconductor processes, a ﬁrst for the 
global semiconductor industry. TSMC also continues to 
work with the government and is planning to complete 
the Tainan Anping Reclaimed Water Plant in 2023, 
which is estimated to reclaim 35,000 m3 of water per 
day for TSMC facilities in the Southern Taiwan Science 
Park (STSP). TSMC's goal is to increase the supply 
of reclaimed water to gradually reduce city water 
consumption each year. The Company is also exploring 
the concept of being water positive in the hope of 
restoring water resources in the future and upholding 
sustainable water practices.

Manage Water Resource Risks

Every year, TSMC evaluates the water risk levels of 
all TSMC facilities using the Water Risk Atlas from 
the World Resources Institute (WRI). Results from 
2022 were identical to those of 2021: WaferTech 
was rated as low risk; TSMC facilities in Taiwan 
and VisEra were rated as medium-to-low risk; and 
TSMC (China) and TSMC (Nanjing) were rated as 
high and medium-to-high risk, respectively, due to 
regional water quality diﬀerences. In 2022, TSMC 
added Fab 18B into the water risk evaluation. 
While building Fab 18B, TSMC preemptively 
elevated foundations, installed ﬂoodgates, and 
applied existing recycling systems and wastewater 
treatment measures to the facility. By the time 
Fab 18B became operational, it already possessed 
outstanding ﬂood protection and process water 
recycling rate, which enabled it to maximize water 

resources and mitigate environmental impact.

Eﬀective Water Management with AWS

In 2022, Fab 12A, Fab 12B, and Fab 5 at Hsinchu 
Science Park and Advanced Backend Fab 3 at 
Lungtan Science Park obtained Alliance for Water 
Stewardship (AWS) Platinum certiﬁcation. All 
advanced TSMC fabs in Taiwan's three science 
parks have obtained AWS Platinum certiﬁcation (the 
highest level available) for three consecutive years, 
a ﬁrst for the global semiconductor industry.

Sustainable water stewardship at TSMC complies 
with AWS standards. In 2022, the Company 
introduced water reclaimed from industrial 
wastewater to facilities at the STSP for the ﬁrst 

time. The reclaimed water was gradually supplied 
to Fab 6, Fab 14, and Fab 18 to reduce city 
water consumption and achieve the preliminary 
target toward sustainable water balance. TSMC's 
eﬀorts toward good water quality include a 
new tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) 
treatment system in Fab 3 to eﬀectively reduce 
eﬄuent concentration by 90%; 70% copper 
concentration reduction from eﬄuents discharged 
by Advanced Backend Fab 3 to improve local 

creek water quality. After improving the cooling 
equipment of the reaction tank and reducing the 
batch reaction time, in June 2022, the hyfroﬂuoric 
(HF) acid waste regeneration system in Fab 15B 
achieved zero treatment outsourcing of the HF 
acid waste liquid. The hydroﬂuoric acid waste 
regeneration system processed a cumulative 
total of 4,193 metric tons of HF acid waste and 
produced 1,025 metric tons of cryolite in 2022. In 
addition, ecological restoration and soil and water 

conservation in areas surrounding TSMC facilities 
are AWS implementation priorities. TSMC compiled 
the TSMC Fireﬂy Habitat Management Process 
to bring back ﬁreﬂies and launched aﬀorestation 
initiatives. In 2022, over 1,900 adult ﬁreﬂies 
appeared across TSMC's three major factories. The 
Company also planted 108,000 trees and 320,000 
shrubs, expanding aﬀorested areas to 10.1 
hectares to create a healthier water environment.

Strengthen In-house Water Reclamation and Water Use Eﬃciency

Water Saving Measures and Achievements in 2022

TSMC has created an internal Water Map platform to 
eﬀectively manage and gain insights into water used 
in TSMC facilities. The Company also continues to 
track reservoir water levels and install in-house water 
quality and water level monitoring points to monitor 
water usage, recycled water, wastewater, and 
domestic water consumption in processes according 
to the water balance chart. This forms the basis 
for integrating water consumption and recycle and 
reuse mechanisms to calculate recycling/discharge 
rates and allocate water to units that use water. In 
2022, TSMC continued to implement four major 
water saving measures: reducing facility system 
water consumption, increasing the wastewater 
recycling of facilities, improving the water production 
rate of the system, and decreasing water discharge 
loss from the system. The Company conserved 3.35 
million m3 of water and yielded a wafer unit water 

consumption of 137.3 liter per 12-inch equivalent 
wafer mask layer, a 2.6% reduction from the 140.9 
liter per 12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer in 
2010, the base year. Nevertheless, TSMC failed to 
reach the 2022 target because new facilities built in 
2022 were still in risk production stages. Though the 
new facilities have not yet reached economic scale, 
there was still a ﬁxed amount of water consumption, 
which led to a lower water saving rate. Wastewater 
discharge was 93.0 liter per 12-inch equivalent wafer 
mask layer, an 18% increase from last year. The 
increase was also caused by the water consumption 
for risk production in new facilities. Before the new 
facilities reach economic scale in production, TSMC 
will continue to optimize operating parameters 
for water recycling systems, increase water use 
eﬃciency, and reduce wastewater discharge.

Product Water Footprint

TSMC is committed to reducing product water 
footprint in various stages, including raw material 
manufacturing and transportation, product 
manufacturing, testing, and packaging, etc. The 
water footprint of products is assessed every three 
years. In 2022, the Company obtained third-party 
ISO 14046 certiﬁcation. According to the Company's

2021 product water footprint survey, TSMC facilities 
consume 79% of water (mainly from direct water 
consumption by facilities) and raw material suppliers 
consume the remaining 21% of water (mainly 
chemical, silicon wafer, and bulk gas suppliers). 
In terms of water quality indicators, TSMC and 
raw material suppliers account for 47% and 53%, 
respectively. Water pollutants are mainly suspended 
solids, metals, and chemical oxygen demand (COD). 
In addition to actively reducing water consumption 
from production processes and discharge of 
water pollutants, TSMC also helps suppliers to set 
water conservation targets with the Sustainability 
Management Self-Assessment Questionnaire. 
All suppliers are required to adhere to the TSMC 
Supplier Code of Conduct to manage water use 
and discharge, while identifying opportunities for 
water saving and implementing measures. For more 
details, please refer to Sustainable Supply Chain in 
this report.

Reclaimed Water Supply Schedule

Develop Diverse Water Sources

The year 2022 marked the start of water reclamation 
at TSMC. To get the most out of every drop of water, 
TSMC is actively conserving water from production 
processes while also developing water reclamation 
technologies. To ensure water quality complies with 
advanced process speciﬁcations and their demands 
for cleanliness, TSMC works with the government, 
industry, and academia to develop low-energy 
consumption biological treatment, low-energy 
consumption sludge treatment, high-eﬃciency urea 
removal process, and other innovative technologies. 
The Company also establishes multi-layered, real-
time, and automatic monitoring systems to ensure 
the quality of reclaimed water supplies. In September 
2022, the TSMC Tainan Science Park Reclaimed Water 
Plant entered into operation as a center for processing, 
monitoring, and supplying TSMC facilities in the STSP. 
As of December 2022, the Reclaimed Water Plant has 
supplied 380,000 m3 of water reclaimed from industrial 
wastewater. To develop diverse water resources, the 
Water Reclamation Plant in Anping, Tainan, will be 

completed and enter into operation in 2023. In 2026, 
the water supply capacity of the Tainan Science Park 
Reclaimed Water Plant will reach up to 36,000 m3 per 
day, reducing city water consumption and contributing 
positively to the surrounding environment. TSMC is also 
designing innovative systems to reclaim concentrated 
wastewater and make waste sludge reusable through 
waste heat, thereby reducing the discharge of high-
concentration wastewater.

In 2022, TSMC completed the TSMC Tainan Science 
Park Reclaimed Water Plant and also launched the 
Hsinchu Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant project 
to expand the use of reclaimed water. The Hsinchu 
Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant is expected to 
supply 10,000 m3 of water per day in 2025. With the 
Hsinchu Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant and 
reclaimed water provided by the city government, 
new fabs in the Hsinchu Science Park will use 100% 
reclaimed water, strengthening TSMC's operational 
resiliency and fulﬁlling the commitment to achieve 
sustainable water cycle management.

Develop Preventive Measures

TSMC continues to advance the performance of 
water pollution control and treatment processes. 
As advanced processes have evolved and 
increased the use of organic chemicals, TSMC 
has introduced a membrane bioreactor system 
to strengthen water pollutant removal. In 2022, 
average COD and TMAH concentration levels were 
reduced to 151.5 ppm and 3.75 ppm, respectively. 
Fab 15B introduced rotating packed bed 
technology in 2022 to further reduce COD levels. 
Lab test results showed that 70% of COD levels in 
water can be reduced. TSMC plans to officially roll

out this technology in 2023. Due to the increased 
use of cobalt sulfate, cobalt sulfate treatment 
systems have also been expanded, which have 
helped to achieve a 54.3% water pollution 
composite indicator reduction rate, far exceeding 
the 2022 target of 45% and 2030 goal of 50%. As 
such, the reduction rate goal for 2030 has been 
raised to over 60% to achieve environmental 
sustainability.

Wastewater Classiﬁcation and Resource 
System

To classify and treat wastewater, TSMC has 
developed 38 separation systems based on the 
composition and concentration of wastewater 
for treatment, recycling, and reuse. In the third 
quarter of 2022, Fab 15B successfully eliminated 
HF acid waste outsourcing by optimizing the 
hydroﬂuoric acid waste regeneration system, 
further perfecting the renewable technologies 
of local circular economy industries. TSMC also 
performed sludge tests, a byproduct of the 
chemical mechanical polishing process, at the 
Zero Waste Manufacturing Center, turning sludge 
into aluminum silicon oxide through dehydration, 
grinding, and surface modiﬁcation. The aluminum 
silicon oxide can then be used as plastic ﬁllers for 
factory use.

Case Study

Innovative HOCI Conversion System Reduces Chemical 
Consumption and Carbon Emissions

As semiconductor technologies continue to evolve, the 
consumption of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI) increases 
to treat pollutants in wastewater. To practice green 
manufacturing, reduce environmental impacts, and 
improve the water quality of eﬄuents, TSMC launched 
the NaOCI reduction project in 2022. Between pH 5.5 
and 6.5, NaOCl turns into hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a 
strong oxidizing agent approximately 80 times stronger 
than NaOCl. TSMC capitalized on HOCI's strong oxidizing 
properties by adding recycled sulfuric acid to NaOCl with 
deionized water (DI water). After optimizing the mixing 

ratio, it became possible to convert NaOCl to HOCl stably, 
reducing NaOCI consumption without compromising 
disinfection and ammonia nitrogen removal. In 2022, the 
HOCI conversion system was introduced to Fab 15B for 
pilot run. It is estimated that annual NaOCI consumption 
and carbon emissions can be reduced by 80 metric 
tons and 10 metric tons, respectively. The Company will 
continue to roll out the system in other facilities as it 
is friendlier for the environment and can increase the 
reuse value of waste liquids, promoting environmental 
sustainability through green innovation.

Power to Change Society

TSMC is a committed advocate of the circular 
economy and upholds the management principles 
of "minimizing waste, maximizing resource recycling, 
and optimizing vendor management" in its eﬀorts 
to develop a comprehensive waste management 
system. As the Company continues to develop 
advanced processes, more raw materials are 

consumed and more waste is produced. As such, 
TSMC strives to achieve resource sustainability 
through three major strategies: source reduction, 
circular economy, and audit and guidance. In 
2022, the Company's waste recycling rate reached 
96%, and the landﬁll rate was less than 1% for 
13 consecutive years. TSMC is also working with 

vendors to deploy renewable technologies that can 
successfully produce green energy from organic 
sludge and reuse activated carbon waste in-house to 
create a circular system. In addition, to strengthen 
sustainable practices in our vendors, TSMC is actively 
promoting the System of Waste Intelligent Fast Track 
(S.W.I.F.T.) to help transform and upgrade vendors. In 

2022, TSMC also organized communication sessions 
for 55 vendors and updated the Company's ﬁve 
critical checkpoints. By 2030, S.W.I.F.T. is expected 
to be deployed at all waste treatment vendors as 
everyone joins hands to create a better environment.

Promote Source Reduction

TSMC is actively practicing green manufacturing 
and implementing source reduction strategies 
to minimize waste. The interdepartmental Waste 
Management Task Force utilizes the Plan-Do-
Check-Act (PDCA) management cycle to set 
waste reduction goals and improvement plans at 
the beginning of each year. The Task Force also 
leverages the Unit Waste Production Management 
System to directly manage and control waste 
production and reduction. Waste management 
units convene monthly to track the progress and 

outcomes of waste reduction measures. In 2022, 
TSMC was able to reduce waste by over 20,000 
metric tons through 129 projects that reduced 
chemical use time and quantity, adopted new 
chemicals, and extended use cycles.

Wafer cleaning processes and their cleanliness 
levels are important factors impacting yield. The 
higher yield demands of advanced processes 
have increased the use of sulfuric acids (cleaning 
solvent). Process, equipment, and facility 

organizations worked together to improve post-
wet-etching cleaning steps by increasing acid 
valve speeds for sulfuric peroxide mixture (SPM) 
cleaning processes by 54%. In 2022, sulfuric acid 
waste produced from cleaning each 12" wafer  
was successfully reduced by 20% without 
compromising quality. In 2023, this process will be 
deployed to all facilities, which is expected to help 
reduce sulfuric acid waste liquid by 30,000 metric 
tons in 2024.

Case Study

Activated Carbon Waste Reactivation: Creating NT$30 Million of 
Green Beneﬁts

TSMC is committed to carrying out source 
reduction strategies. By developing a closed-
loop cycle to recycle waste for in-house use, 
the Company has been able to reduce resource 
consumption and minimize environmental 
impacts. Activated carbon is used to recycle 
wastewater at TSMC. The resulting waste was 
previously outsourced to waste treatment 
vendors for treatment. To increase the waste's 
value, TSMC worked with vendors to research 

C  

ways to recycle activated carbon and was 
able to produce recycled carbon by subjected 
activated carbon waste to temperatures of 800
°
and then cooling it. To ensure the quality of 
recycled carbon complies with TSMC standards, 
several parameters were repeatedly tested 
and veriﬁed: hardness (loss from abrasions), 
iodine value (adsorption capabilities), and 
apparent density (activation levels). In 2022, 
TSMC was able to produce recycled activated 

carbon with adsorption capabilities and use 
cycles consistent with new activated carbon. 
The recycling process will be deployed to all 
Taiwan fabs in 2023, which will allow the reuse 
of activated carbon to reduce outsourcing 
by 6,000 metric tons and generate NT$30 
million in green beneﬁts each year, eﬀectively 
growing the Company's circular economy and 
supporting environmental sustainability.

Enhance Circular Economy

In addition to source reduction, TSMC is also 
carrying out circular economy practices to fulﬁll 
long-term goals for 2030 of outsourcing less than 
0.5kg of waste per wafer unit. Through the Action 
Plan to Turn Waste into High-Value Products, 
resource recycling equipment were deployed in 
the Taiwan fabs that were able to increase the 
recycling of six types of waste liquids into high-
value products for internal use or sale. Over 
260,000 metric tons of resources were recycled 
with an in-house resource recycling rate of 28%, 
which was 6% higher than in 2021 and generated 
NT$1 billion in beneﬁts. The central utility plant 
structure of the Zero Waste Manufacturing Center 
was completed, which is slated to enter into 
operation in 2023. As for the Electronics-grade 
Chemicals Recycling Program, TSMC continues to 
conduct evaluations and expects to purify waste 
into electronic-grade chemicals for internal use. 
The closed-loop cycle can reduce operating risks 
and maximize the value of recycled products.

The Industry Cooperation to Co-create Resources 
Project involves working with vendors from other 
industries to reduce incineration and landﬁll 
rates. In 2022, TSMC increased recycling rates 
from 95% to 96% and reduced landﬁll rates from 
0.2% to 0.1%. To achieve the 2050 goal of net 
zero emissions and zero waste, TSMC worked with 
vendors and introduced anaerobic digestion to 
treat organic sludge, which can then be used to 
generate green energy. The Company was also

able to reuse instead of incinerating plastic waste 
through four principles: source management, 
internal and external sorting, innovative 
technologies, and high-value products. In 2022, 
TSMC successfully developed garbage bags from 
100% recycled materials for internal use. Other 
plastic waste was converted into solid fuel and 
supplied to combined heat and power (CHP) 
cogeneration plants to reduce coal consumption. 
The technology will go live in the fourth quarter of 
2022 and be deployed to all facilities in 2023.

Phase 1 and 2 of Fab 12 previously obtained the 
highest platinum rating for zero waste to landﬁlls 
(UL 2799), and all Taiwan facilities and subsidiaries 
will seek to obtain UL 2799 certiﬁcation in 2023 
and 2025, respectively, as well. In addition, as most 
of TSMC's waste treatment vendors use diesel 
trucks, TSMC launched the Electric Waste Removal 
Truck Program in 2022 and started conducting 
assessments. It was discovered that electric 
trucks produce 45% fewer carbon emissions per 
kilometer than diesel trucks. The Program is part 
of the Company's eﬀorts to uphold the TSMC 
Environmental Policy.

Case Study

Green Energy Cycle: 2.2 kWh of Green Energy from 1 Metric Ton of Organic Sludge

To promote green innovation, TSMC worked with vendors to launch the 
Anaerobic Digestion of Organic Sludge R&D Project, using anaerobic 
digestion (AD) to treat organic sludge and produce marsh gas, a form of 
bio-energy, for the ﬁrst time. In 2022, the Company ﬁled an application 
to the Hsinchu Science Park Administration and received approval 
in September to test out AD for organic sludge treatment at Fab 12 
Phases 6 and 7. As of the end of December, the incineration of organic 
sludge was successfully reduced by 125 metric tons.

and produce marsh gas, which is primarily comprised 

hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and 

Using anaerobic bacteria, it is possible to break down organic sludge 
through four stages
methanogenesis
of methane, for power generation. Each metric ton of organic sludge 
can generate approximately 2.2 kWh of energy through AD. The goal 
is to recycle instead of incinerate 100% of organic sludge in 2024, 
which reduces outsourced incineration by 6,500 metric tons, increases 
recycling rates at Taiwan facilities by 1%, and creates a circular system 
that can help usher in the future of green energy.

Strengthen Audit and Guidance

To ensure a safe waste clean-up system, 
TSMC established the Supplier Transportation 
Management White Paper, requiring waste clean-
up vendors to strengthen systems for waste-
removal trucks, drivers, processes before/during/
after clean-up, and education and training and 
obtain ISO 45001 certiﬁcation before 2023. Waste 
clean-up vendors are asked to protect employee 
health and reduce environmental risks by creating 
safe workplaces. As of the end of 2022, 80% of 
waste clean-up vendors have obtained ISO 45001 

certiﬁcation. In the same year, TSMC conducted on-
site audits of 41 waste clean-up vendors, inspected 
100% of tank trucks and sludge clean-up trucks, 
and mitigated ten deﬁciencies.

TSMC believes that corporate growth and 
environmental protection go hand in hand. To such 
end, waste treatment vendors are asked to improve 
environmental protection practices and prevent 
any possibility of illegal waste disposal through 
TSMC's Waste Treatment Vendor Sustainability 

Enhancement Project. In the ﬁrst stage, new vendor 
selection, an interdisciplinary team of experts 
conducts document reviews and on-site inspections 
across six dimensions to ensure compliance in 
waste treatment, facilities, and on-site operations. 
Approved vendors then enter the second stage, 
which includes quarterly on-site audits to conﬁrm 
the ﬂow of waste. In 2022, new assessment items 
were added on environmental sustainability to 
two of the eight dimensions evaluated during 
annual audits, operations management and waste 

management. The items added drive vendors to 
work with TSMC toward a sustainable environment 
by obtaining ISO certiﬁcations, reducing and taking 
stock of GHG emissions, committing to carbon 
neutrality, recycling resources, and implementing 
smart management. Lastly, vendors that perform 
poorly in three dimensions assessed during annual 
audits are replaced to enforce green practices 
throughout the supply chain.

In 2022, TSMC conducted on-site audits of 58 
waste treatment vendors, reaching an audit 
ratio of 100% and mitigating 106 deﬁciencies. 
The number of deﬁciencies was reduced by 17% 
from 2021, and the percentage of Excellent and 
Good vendors has increased from 36% in 2015 
to 80%. In 2022, another long-term KPI was 
added under the Circular Resource section
―
increase the percentage of Excellent & Good 
waste treatment vendors to 90% by 2030
to 
enhance vendor quality and generate greater 
impacts on sustainability from the supply chain. 
Additionally, 84% of waste treatment vendors 
have obtained ISO 14001 certiﬁcation. All waste 
treatment vendors are expected to obtain the 
certiﬁcation by the end of 2030.

TSMC continues to leverage digital tools to 
improve the Intelligent Waste Management 
Procedure with Full Traceability. In 2022, the 
EPA invited the Company to the Environmental 
Regulation Enforcement & Corporate Integrity 
Forum and National Environmental Regulation 
Enforcement Conference to share how it was 
able to strengthen management, recycle 
resources, and reduce risks of illegal disposal 
by vendors. By sharing its experiences, TSMC 
hopes to lead the industry into a sustainable 
future through digital transformation.

TSMC is committed to air pollution control and has 
adopted the Emission Source Classiﬁcation method 
and multi-phase Best Available Technology (BAT) to 
enhance the performance of pollution control. In 2022, 
Wet Electrostatic Precipitator Scrubber was applied 
in TSMC process for the ﬁrst time, which used high-
temperature sulfuric acid for cleaning, reducing  
alkaline gases and particulate matter (PM2.5) by 90% 
and 91%, respectively. The Company also actively 
monitoring and managing air pollution emissions 
from control equipment, expanding the Environmental 
Lab's responsibilities to include the following three 

Air Pollution Control Procedures

areas: air pollution monitoring, water quality analysis, 
and environmental protection in surrounding areas. 
In addition, TSMC is conducting veriﬁcations to help 
facilities quickly identify target pollutants, apply 
BAT, and introducing Eﬄuents and Water Quality 
Management for Scrubbers to regularly inspect water 
quality to ensure air pollution control equipment is 
operating at optimum levels. In 2022, TSMC was able 
to meet the annual target for air pollutant emissions 
per unit of production as well as the annual target for 
volatile organic gases reduction, continuing to move 
toward sustainability goals.

Adopt Best Available Technology

Acid, alkaline, and volatile organic gases comprise 
the majority of air pollutants produced by the 
semiconductor industry. TSMC employs two 
approaches - Classiﬁcation and Reduction of Emission 
from Sources and Strengthened Management of 
Terminal Prevention Facilities to achieve BAT with this 
multi-phase system and eﬀectively control air pollutant 
emissions. Exhaust gases are separated in the ﬁrst 
stage based on their properties - toxic, corrosive, 
ﬂammable, perﬂuorocarbon greenhouse gases, 
and acidic/alkaline. The gases are ﬁrst introduced 

to high-eﬃciency local scrubbers that will process 
highly concentrated pollutants. The gases with low 
concentrations will then be sent to central scrubbers, 
which are terminal prevention facilities, for the second 
stage of rinsing and neutralization. Depending on 
their boiling points, volatile organic gases may be 
sent to condensation type scrubbers ﬁrst and then to 
zeolite rotor concentrators for adsorption, reducing 
emissions and improving decontamination results.

Source Reduction and Management – 
High Eﬃciency Local Scrubbers

As TSMC accelerates the development of 
advanced process technologies, the New Tool & 
New Chemical Review Committee evaluates the 
hazard of new processes and chemicals on ESH to 
prevent added risks of air pollution. In 2022, the 
Committee conducted 430 reviews for 198 new 
tools and 232 new chemicals. The two-stage review 
enables the Committee to carefully identify optimal 
separation methods and local scrubbers for 
new tools and chemicals. Depending on exhaust 
gas properties, they are sent to diﬀerent types 
of local scrubbers - thermal, burn, plasma, wet 
with chemical dosage, adsorption, condensation, 
and wet - for pre-treatment. As TSMC continues 
to bring in new types of high eﬃciency local 
scrubbers, the Company is also working with 
suppliers to optimize the performances of existing 
local scrubbers. In 2022, TSMC applied the wet 
electrostatic precipitator scrubber in the process 
which used high-temperature sulfuric acid for 
cleaning in Fab 12B, using corona technologies 
and wet scrubber method to remove pollutants - 
alkaline gases and PM2.5 - at the same time.

Launched in 2021, the three-year High-eﬃciency 
Spray Equipment Upgrade Program to upgrade 
existing thermal-wet scrubber has upgraded 508 
scrubbers, with a ﬁnish rate of 68% by the end of 
2022. To further enhance PM2.5 reduction rates 
of existing local scrubbers, TSMC expanded the 
PM2.5 Reduction Equipment Upgrade Program to

gases are channeled to central treatment facilities 
for scrubbing and acid/alkali neutralization to 
remove pollutants. Exhaust gases from certain 
wet processes that emit large amounts of acid/
alkaline gases are sent to a two-step scrubbing 
– central scrubber connecting washing tower - 
to increase pollutant adsorption. To enhance the 
eﬀectiveness of central scrubbers, existing facilities 
installed hydro membranes, changed ﬁlters, and 
added Raschig rings to optimize tower structures 
and decontamination. TSMC will continue to install 

High-eﬃciency Central Scrubbers in new facilities 
to enhance the overall performance of terminal 
prevention facilities.

As for volatile organic gas treatment, TSMC continues 
to carry out the Low-eﬃciency Single Zeolite Rotor 
Concentrators renew Initiative in existing facilities 
and install Dual Zeolite Rotor Concentrators in new 
facilities. In 2022, all facilities reduced volatile organic 
gases by 98.9%. Due to enhanced prevention and 
control measures, total air pollutant emissions have 

not increased with the addition of new facilities. 
When concentrated gases adsorbed by zeolite 
rotors enter thermal oxidizers, pyrolysis can remove 
volatile organic gas pollutants but may also produce 
the byproduct of nitrous oxide (NOx) pollutants. 
In 2022, Fab 18 Phase 7 applied low nitrous oxide 
burner (low-NOx burner) in the volatile organic gas 
treatment facilities, using Moderate or Intense 
Low Oxygen Dilution (MILD) thermal oxidizers and 
combustion ﬂow ﬁeld control technologies to reduce 
NOx emissions by 65% each year.

In compliance with TSMC Environmental Policy, 
the Company is dedicated to reducing air pollution 
emissions. The Environmental Lab has strengthened 
pollutant monitoring and management for 
stacks, using baseline management to control the 
concentration of air pollutants, achieve source 
reduction and enhance the performance of prevention 
facilities. In 2022, 104 stacks exceeding baseline 
concentration standards have been mitigated by the 
decontamination method, including replacing terminal 
prevention facilities that have reached the end of their 
life cycles, upgrading existing facilities, or introducing 
new high-eﬃciency facilities. The outcome shows 88 
stacks have been mitigated.

For air pollution sampling, the Environmental 
Lab introduced various sampling and analysis 
technologies according to the demands and regulatory 
requirements. In 2022, the Lab developed ways to 
analyze inorganic acids, ammonia, heavy metals, 
NMHCs, etc., to increase the facilities' abilities for 
diﬀerent pollutants identiﬁcation, provide sampling 
data more rapidly, and shorten mitigation period. The 
Lab further traced air pollution sources by sampling 
central scrubber exhaust ducts to conﬁrm the source 
of abnormal exhaust gas emissions. Then, TSMC can 
investigate upstream process tools to clarify special 
gases and emission properties for ensuring the 
coverage rate of local scrubber installation is suﬃcient. 
The Lab also veriﬁes the performance of upgraded 
local scrubber, ﬁller variance, and optimal parameters. 
This allows facilities to rapidly develop optimal 
treatment for target pollutants. In 2022, 2,282 exhaust 
ducts, sub-ducts, and equipment units were sampled 

and tested; 16 cases of mixed acid and alkaline gas 
emissions were found and resolved, and improved 
performances in 15 treatment facilities were veriﬁed.

For water quality testing, the Environmental Lab 
provided the analyzation for 29 items of pollutants 
in scrubber water. The result showed that water 
containing acid-base ions could be turned into 
gaseous pollutants at certain pH levels. In 2022, the 
Environmental Lab established Eﬄuents and Water 
Quality Management for Scrubbers to regularly inspect 
water status to ensure air pollution control equipment 
operates at the optimal levels.

Strengthen Monitoring of Air 
Pollution Prevention Equipment

TSMC is strengthening the reliability of air pollution 
control equipment operating systems and air 
pollution monitoring to ensure compliance with 
Taiwan and overseas regulations. The Company 
also deployed automatic monitoring systems - total 
hydrocarbon monitors, online IPA monitors, and 
online ﬂuorine gas monitors - to rigorously control 
monitoring data and actual emission levels. In 
addition, the Facility Division, Industrial Safety and 
Environmental Protection Division, and Instrument 
Control System Division used Automatic System 
for Legal Air Pollutant Coeﬃcient Upgrades and 
Inspection, Facility Parameter Change Management 
System, and Facility Monitoring and Data Collection 
System to monitor facility parameters. The systems 
automatically compare and inspect data to prevent 
ﬂaws or losses from human error. This eﬀectively 
increases the accuracy and reliability of TSMC reports 
to government agencies.

In addition, to ensure air pollution treatment 
facilities remain at optimal eﬃciency for operations 
all year round, all control equipment is equipped 
with a Dual-track Independent Monitoring System 
that allows the Facility Division and Industrial Safety 
and Environmental Protection Division to perform 
emergency repairs or initiate backup systems to 
minimize damages and losses. TSMC also adopts 
the N+1 rule where all equipment must have at least 
one backup system and uses Uninterrupted Power 
Supply Systems to help fulﬁll the management target 
of zero failure in control equipment. With dedicated 
eﬀorts from various divisions, TSMC is proud to 
report zero abnormal occurrences in air pollution 
control equipment in 2022.

Case Study

Improve Corona Technologies in Air Pollution Control Equipment to 
Reduce Alkaline Gases and PM2.5 by over 90%

With the evolution of advanced processes, TSMC continues to work 
with suppliers to optimize the performance of air pollution prevention 
equipment and has applied Wet Electrostatic Precipitator (wet-EP) 
Scrubbers in the process which used high-temperature sulfuric acid 
for cleaning. As this process simultaneously uses acids, alkaline, 
and organic chemicals, it produces large amounts of acid/alkaline 
gases and high-concentration PM2.5. TSMC improved on wet-EP 
corona technologies to ensure safety and enhance the eﬀectiveness 
of air pollution treatment, changing electricity discharge mode and 
installing protective mechanisms. The improved technology has 
obtained SEMI S2 safety certiﬁcation and, after repeated testing, 
can be used for three-stage pollutant treatment. The ﬁrst stage 
is a washer that transmits gaseous acid/alkaline liquid phases 
for decontamination. The second stage is a particle collector that 
accumulates and removes particulate matter with corona discharge. 
Finally, the gases which have been treated by wet-EP would enter to 
the zeolite rotors for organic pollutant removing. The three-stage 
process can eﬀectively minimize acid/alkaline gases, organic gases, 
and PM2.5 emissions simultaneously.

In 2022, TSMC introduced wet-EP into Fab 12B. Results showed that 
the three stage process was able to remove 90% of alkaline gases, 
and 91% of PM2.5 which is the form of acid gases after reaction. In 
the future, TSMC will continue to evaluate the feasibility and eﬃcacy 
of wet-EP applications to other exhaust gases to reduce air pollution 
emissions and strive toward zero emissions.

Case Study

Optimize Thermal Oxidizer Structures and Treatment Process to Reduce Nitrogen 
Oxide (NOx) Emissions by 65%

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and perﬂuorinated compounds (PFCs) are byproducts of wafer 
manufacturing. Air pollution control equipment mainly uses pyrolysis to remove VOCs and PFCs. However, 
this process also causes dinitrogen (N2) to react with oxygen (O2) in the air and produce nitrogen oxides (NO 
and NO2) pollutants.

TSMC has launched a NOx reduction project in all facilities around the world to comply with assessment 
requirements for the new U.S. facility. First, TSMC conducted survey and analysis for comprehensive stacks 
in the facilities. Results showed that NOx is mainly produced by pyrolysis in local scrubbers and VOC control 
equipment. To reduce NOx emissions, TSMC adapted the structure and treatment processes of thermal 
oxidizers in control equipment, adding swirler to introduce outside air into oxidizers to facilitate combustion. 
Fuel sprinklers are also added for pre-heating in stages. In the ﬁrst stage, the oxygen concentration is 
be lower in the low-temperature reaction. In the second stage, the air with low oxygen concentration is 
introduced into the combustion. Under the low-oxygen combustion, ﬂame temperature dip from 1,600
1,300
are used to change where exhaust gases enter into thermal oxidizers so that the gases can circumvent high-
temperature zones, which reduces the production of thermal NOx.

In 2022, TSMC tested the new process on VOC control equipment in the Fab 18 Phase 7 and was able to 
minimize target pollutants and NOx byproducts by simply adapting thermal oxidizers and using optimal 
temperatures. The process does not compromise the performance of exhaust gas treatment and can reduce 
NOx emissions by 65% each year. TSMC will continue to evaluate ways to improve local scrubbers to further 
reduce NOx production and strive for environmental-friendly goals.

Unleash the Potential of Diverse Talent

In 2022, TSMC organized 15 Inclusive Leadership 
Workshops to support senior executives in 
understanding diversity and inclusion, as well 
as reinforce the awareness of unconscious bias, 
learn how it is formed, and appreciate the value of 
diversity and inclusion in their work through case 
studies. Furthermore, they also learned how to 
create a diverse and inclusive workplace. The training 
completion rate was 81%.

In the same year, the R&D Organization Diversity and 
Inclusion Committee was formed to focus on female 
employees' issues, actively recruit female interns, 
and hold a series of lectures. The aim was not only 
to promote knowledge sharing from the perspective 

Diverse and Inclusive Employee Experience

of career planning and building a workplace 
mentality, but also to facilitate exchanges among 
female colleagues, encourage dialogue between 
diﬀerent generations, and provide all-round support 
for female employees, so as to promote innovative 
values of diversity and inclusion.

Additionally, TSMC oﬃcially established the employee 
resource group Women@tsmc in 2022 to provide 
female employees with a platform to support each 
other. Activities such as female colleagues forums 
and mentoring programs serve to enhance female 
employees' interpersonal networks within the 
Company and encourage them to pursue their 
careers and self-growth. Women@tsmc also supports

In 2023, TSMC will design projects according to 
diﬀerent stages of employees' careers. These include 
experience camps for people with disabilities and job 

content design, forming diverse employee resource 
groups, hosting training courses to raise awareness 
of diversity and inclusion, implementing ﬂexible work 
hours, as well as support programs for expatriates 
and their families in a bid to create a diverse and 
inclusive experience for employees. The purpose is 
also to implement a friendly workplace and unleash 
the potential of diverse talent.

Case Study

Unleash Employee Potential and Create a Role Model for Female Semiconductor Talent

TSMC prides itself on its people-oriented corporate culture. To support the career development of 
female talent in the semiconductor industry, TSMC is committed to realizing the value of diversity 
and inclusion and creating a challenging, fun, and sustainable learning workplace. Through 
teamwork, experience sharing, and guidance programs, the Company can assist female colleagues 
to tap into their potential and develop their strengths, as well as support colleagues in looking 
after their families and work development with a robust employee welfare system. Moreover, 

TSMC recognizes the signiﬁcant contributions of outstanding female colleagues by recommending 
them to participate in external award selections. In turn, the Company can create a role model 
for female talent, encouraging women in science and technology to facilitate the development of 
the semiconductor industry and advance technological innovation. In 2022, TSMC recommended 
numerous outstanding female colleagues to win national and global accolades.

Defending TSMC's industry 
leadership and operation freedom 
is the most honorable mission 
in my career. Thanks to the R&D 
team's innovation achievements 
and the legal team's joint eﬀorts 
that made the new patent record.

My ﬁrst impression of TSMC 
was that it is a company with 
an exceptional ability to get 
things done and an emphasis on 
teamwork.

TSMC's abundant resources and 
innovations enable novel ideas to be 
turned into actions in a short time. 
Thanks to the guidance of senior 
colleagues and mentors, I can complete 
tasks with minimal eﬀort and explore the 
inﬁnite possibilities of semiconductor applications.

Power to Change Society

In 2022, the semiconductor industry continued to 
ﬂourish. To cater to the needs of global customers, 
TSMC expanded investment in Taiwan, the U.S., 
China, Japan, etc. The Company also invested 
in advanced technology R&D and expanded 
production capacity. In addition to bolstering 
the recruitment and cultivation of local talent, 
TSMC advanced to Japan, Southeast Asia, and 
Europe to expand global talent recruitment. In 
2022, TSMC recruited 12,442 new employees 
worldwide, creating 7,817 premium new job 
opportunities, providing employees with 
competitive compensation and welfare systems 
better than statutory requirements, as well as a 
safe and healthy workplace, so that colleagues are 
willing to devote themselves to work, learning, and 

Workforce Type Distribution - by Gender

growth, in turn obtaining a sense of belonging 
and accomplishment. Furthermore, the Company 
strives to respond to their needs through new 
employee care measures in order to successfully 
lower the new employee turnover rate.

Fulﬁll the "Commitment" Core Values

Fulﬁll Core Values

TSMC's core values of Integrity, Commitment, 
Innovation, and Customer Trust were deﬁned 
by TSMC Founder Dr. Morris Chang. Chairman 
Mark Liu and CEO Dr. C.C. Wei expect all TSMC 
employees to uphold these core values, reinforcing 
the Company's business philosophy and vision 
through internal websites, meetings, lectures, 

publications, and various communication channels. 
In the fourth quarter of 2022, a core value survey 
was conducted to listen to employees' feedback on 
the implementation of the Company's core values 
and relevant strengthening measures that will be 
launched in 2023. Through seminars and case 
studies, the Company aims to enhance employees' 
understanding and experience of the core values, 
thereby ensuring that employees can grow together 
with TSMC.

When it comes to talent attraction and retention, 
TSMC has always believed in "putting the right 
people with the shared vision and values in the right 
positions". "Shared vision" means that all employees 
share the same vision and mission; "shared values" 

means that all employees abide by the same core 
values and code of conduct; and the "right people 
in the right positions" means that the Company is 
dedicated to helping employees unleash their full 
potential in the right positions.

Strong Talent Pool

TSMC has remained true to its core values and has 
always strived to be a company that employees 
can be proud of. In 2022, the total number of 
global employees was 73,677, consisting of 
73,090 permanent and 587 temporary employees 
based on employment contract type.  In terms of 
employment type, 73,310 were full-time employees 
and 367 part-time employees.

● Reinforce the Recruitment of Female 
and Foreign Science and Engineering 
Talent

To encourage more outstanding female science 
and engineering talent to join the Company, TSMC 
continues to provide female colleagues with a 
friendly and supportive workplace. In 2022, two 
female career-sharing and interview sessions were 
held, inviting female executives to share their work 
and workplace experience to help participants better 
understand the semiconductor industry and TSMC.

Additionally, TSMC continues to expand its diverse 
talent pool. The total number of foreign employees 
in 2022 was 1,147, accounting for 1.6% of global 
employees; 2.3% of new employees in 2022 were 
foreign employees, higher than the proportion 
of foreign employees among all employees; the 

Number of Permanent Employees 
Worldwide

Unit: Number of People

proportion of women in new managers reached 
16.3%.

● Recruitment Criteria

Abiding by the guidelines of shared vision and 
values, and the basis of diversity and inclusion, TSMC 
does not discriminate against candidates because 
of their gender, religion, race, nationality, or political 
aﬃliation. TSMC prioritizes character and capability 
over professional skills when assessing candidates. 
All candidates must pass rigorous selection criteria 
and interviews for a comprehensive evaluation 
before they are welcomed on board.

● Talent Recruitment in Taiwan Fabs and 

VisEra

TSMC's global recruitment stresses local hiring. 
However, in the principal place of business, Taiwan 

fabs and VisEra, the Company must consider 
technological development and diversity. Therefore, 
in addition to the recruitment of professionals and 
recent graduates, overseas special professionals are 
listed as a recruitment focus as well.

 » Strengthen Internship Program

In 2022, TSMC continued the 2021 DNA Internship 
Program, which revolves around the theme of 
Development, Navigation, and Advance Oﬀer to 
provide diverse learning activities and practical 
project involvement such as lectures, courses, and 
workshops to give interns the opportunity for self-
discovery and learning about the semiconductor 
industry and technologies. Outstanding interns were 
given advance oﬀers to TSMC upon graduation, 
contributing to the success of both the students and 
the Company.

In 2022, TSMC welcomed 639 interns through 
the DNA Internship Program, of which 31% (195 
interns) were female students. After the internship, 
226 interns were evaluated as outstanding and 
received advance oﬀers, accounting for 35% of 
total interns. Of them, 29% were female students.

 » Disabled Employees

In compliance with local regulations, TSMC hired 
a total of 443 employees with mild or moderate 
disabilities, and 109 employees with severe 
disabilities. In light of the rapid growth of the 
number of employees, TSMC has also vigorously 
recruited disabled personnel. In 2022, the 
Company organized two recruitment brieﬁng 
sessions for disabled personnel and added 

job vacancy announcement channels to reach 
more potential talents. In 2023, TSMC expects 
to join forces with school resource centers and 
government employment service centers to 
increase the recruitment of disabled talents. 
The Company also plans to launch a workplace 
experience camp for disabled interns, helping 
TSMC in restructuring speciﬁc job positions for 
the disabled. Furthermore, disabled interns 
with outstanding performances will be hired 
as permanent employees. VisEra also provided 
vacancies for disabled candidates. However, due 
to the nature of job vacancies, VisEra received a 
dearth of suitable applicants, leading to its failure 
to meet minimum requirement of 1% and has paid 
subsidies according to legal regulation.

terms of industry-academia cooperation, TSMC 
has closely maintained long-term connections 
with MIT, Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Tokyo 
University, and other prestigious universities 
around the world to incubate top research talents 
and ensure early engagement with global talents 
for future recruitment. In addition to recruiting 
semiconductor professionals in major cities in 
the U.S., Singapore, and Malaysia, TSMC has also 
expanded its scope to include European IT talents, 
attracting new talents via online brieﬁngs and 
physical recruitment activities.

To help foreign employees quickly adapt to the new 
environment, TSMC oﬀers assistance for relocation 
and settlement including exclusive newcomer 
orientation, subsidies for learning Chinese, and 
rewards for receiving Chinese certiﬁcates, so as 
to encourage foreign employees to assimilate 
into the workplace and environment of Taiwan. 
In addition, TSMC also invites foreign employees 
and their families to join exclusive groups such as 
the Formosa Cultural Society and Indian Culture 
Research Society. The Company also holds cultural 
festivals such as Thanksgiving and Indian Diwali 
etc., to increase mutual communication. In 2022,

Employee Commitment 

Competitive Compensation Packages 

In 2021, TSMC introduced the Engagement Survey, 
created using WTW's High Performing Employee 
Experience Model as a blueprint, to systematically 
learn about employees' experiences at work and 
analyze the Company's advantages and opportunities 
to formulate improvement measures. In 2022, three 
improvement measures were completed.

Engagement Survey Improvement 
Measures

Improvement 
Measures

2022 Improvement 
Measures

Establish an open-
style management 
system and foster a 
workplace of mutual 
respect. Encourage 
employees to speak 
up and encourage 
management 
to be open to 
suggestions and 
make appropriate 
responses.

Unleash employees' 
potential, allowing 
them to enjoy work 
and learn and grow 
continuously to 
garner a tremendous 
sense of belonging 
and achievement.

In addition to cash 
rewards, non-
monetary incentives 
are also used to 
motivate and retain 
talent.

Held CEO's communication 
meetings in Hsinchu, 
Taichung, and Tainan, and 
expanded the scope of labor-
management meetings 
by adding Silicon Garden 
Meeting to each organization. 
Representatives were selected 
through peer voting, while 
suggestions and ideas could 
be submitted anonymously 
through representatives.

Launched physical and online 
courses complemented by 
diverse learning resources 
such as internal/external 
learning platforms to let 
colleagues enjoy learning at 
work.

Launched WeCare Survey and 
regular questionnaire surveys 
to care about new hires. 
Retention interviews were 
also carried out for groups at 
risk of resignation in a bid to 
improve problems promptly.

TSMC provides competitive compensation packages 
to attract and retain the best talent, as well as reward 
employee performance and encourage long-term 
contribution. Besides referring to market information 
of selected benchmark companies and compensation 
survey reports, the Company also reviews market 
information on compensation data of the whole 
industry for competitiveness analysis to develop the 
most eﬀective compensation strategies.

TSMC's compensation package includes a base salary, 
allowances, cash bonuses, and proﬁt-sharing schemes. 
In 2022, the average annual compensation of a newly 
graduated TSMC engineer with a master's degree at 
Taiwan fabs and VisEra was higher than NT$2 million. 
The average compensation of direct laborers was 
higher than NT$1 million, which is four times the 
minimum monthly wages in Taiwan. Compared with 
the previous year, Taiwan fabs experienced year-on-
year growth in 2022 in terms of the number of full-time 
employees, average salary, and median salary.

In addition to cash basis compensation, starting from 
2022, regular employees of TSMC and its 100%-owned 
subsidiaries may participate in the Global Employee 
Stock Purchase Program. TSMC oﬀers a 15% stock 
purchase subsidy to encourage colleagues to purchase 
company stocks and participate in the Company's long-
term success. A total of 70% of colleagues worldwide 
participate in the program.

In recent years, TSMC has continued to grow in 
revenue and proﬁt. The Company has increased total 
compensation and beneﬁts for employees from around 
NT$108.2 billion to NT$239.5 billion between 2018 and 
2022, and average compensation and beneﬁts for every 

employee from NT$2.21 million to NT$3.25 million 
during the same period. According to the Engagement 
Survey conducted in 2021, 81% of colleagues believe 
that the Company provides reasonable overall rewards 
and compensation. This result is better than that of 
global high-performance companies (67%) and high-
tech companies (66%) participating in WTW Global's 
survey, indicating that besides oﬀering competitive 
compensation in the market, TSMC's rewards are also 
recognized by colleagues as being reasonable.

In 2022, TSMC's revenue and proﬁt reached a new 
record high yet again. The cash bonuses and proﬁt-
sharing schemes allocated for Taiwan fabs were valued 
at NT$121.4 billion, and the annual salary adjustment 
for 2022 also took place as planned.

● Bonus

The incentive program of TSMC facilities in Taiwan is 
implemented over two years. Cash bonuses are paid 
quarterly to provide timely incentives and proﬁt-sharing 
is paid annually in the following year to encourage 
long-term service and continuous contribution. The 
incentive programs of overseas regions are designed 
in consideration of local cultures and markets and are 
given out through annual cash bonuses or long-term 
one to three-year schemes. In 2022, the median total 
compensation of TSMC employees globally (excluding 
pension and other beneﬁts) was approximately 
NT$2.33 million, which was 1/276 of the CEO's total 
compensation. The median of the CEO's annual total 
compensation percentage increase and the annual 
average total compensation percentage increase was 
around 3.4:1.

● Corporate Oﬃcer Shareholding 

Guidelines

TSMC believes that the long-term ownership of 
company shares by corporate oﬃcers helps align 
their interests with those of all shareholders; 
therefore, the Company formulated the Corporate 
Oﬃcer Shareholding Guidelines in 2020. The 
required value for the Chairman, CEO, and other 
corporate oﬃcers' holding of TSMC shares is 
proportional to their annual base salary. Oﬃcers 
shall achieve the required value within three years 
of their appointment and maintain the required 
value for the entire period of their employment.

● Executive Oﬃcer Compensation Policy

TSMC's policies, systems, standards, and structures 
pertinent to the compensation of executive oﬃcers 
are stipulated and assessed by the independent 
Compensation and People Development 
Committee, including monthly salaries, quarterly 

performance bonuses, and compensation paid 
based on annual proﬁt conditions. If necessary, 
sign-on bonuses will be oﬀered to attract critical 
talent. Since 2021, TSMC has oﬀered Employee 
Restricted Stock Awards for corporate executives 
and critical talents to link their compensation with 
shareholders' interests and environmental, social, 
and governance (ESG) performance. In 2021 and 
2022, the Employee Restricted Stock Awards Rules 
were stipulated; please refer to 4.6.1 Status of 
Employee Restricted Stock in the Company's 2022 
annual report. According to laws and regulations, 
proposals related to the compensation of the 
Company and executive oﬃcers must be submitted 
to the Compensation and People Development 
Committee for deliberation and forwarded to the 
Board of Directors for resolution. Matters requiring 
the approval of the shareholders' meeting will take 
eﬀect after the proposed resolutions has been 
presented at the shareholders' meeting and a 

vote has been conducted in accordance with legal 
procedures. In addition to the aforementioned 
compensation policy, TSMC also provides a 
retirement policy that is better than the statutory 
requirements of Labor Standards Act to ensure 
future viability of executive oﬃcers' retirement 
beneﬁts. Furthermore, in response to the 
regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission, TSMC will formulate a claw-back 
policy for the compensation of executive oﬃcers 
in 2023 to enhance corporate governance and 

ensure the Company's ﬁnancial integrity.

● Parental Beneﬁts 

TSMC provides breastfeeding and breast milk 
collection rooms to support the breast milk 
collection needs of female employees. Besides, 
providing parental leave in accordance with local 
laws and regulations for employees after childbirth, 
the Company also oﬀers a comprehensive leave 

management system so that employees have 
ﬂexibility in making use of their vacation days to take 
care of their children. In addition, TSMC launched 
the TSMC Child Care Beneﬁt Program in 2022 to help 
employees balance their personal and work needs.

In 2022, a total of 672 employees in TSMC's Taiwan 
fabs and VisEra applied for unpaid parental leave. 
The expected number of employees to return from 
parental leave for the year was 710, of which 589 
employees returned on time or ahead of time, 
achieving an 83% return to work rate. As for the 
retention rate after returning, of the 445 employees 
who returned to work in 2021, a total of 375 
remained at TSMC as of the end of 2022, achieving 
an 84.3% retention rate.

In 2022, the number of employees in TSMC's Taiwan 
fabs and VisEra aged between 20 and 64 accounted 
for 0.43% of Taiwan's population of the same 
age group. During the same time, the number of

employees' newborns was 2,368, which was 1.7% of 
the total number of newborns in Taiwan, an example 
of the Company's outstanding beneﬁts in mitigating 
the impact of sub-replacement fertility in Taiwan.

● Solid Pension System

TSMC established its statutory deﬁned beneﬁt plan 
and supervisory committee of labor retirement 
reserve according to the Labor Standards Act, and 
also set up its statutory deﬁned contribution plan 
according to the Labor Pension Act, which was 
eﬀective starting July 1, 2005. For each region, TSMC 
also established pension plans according to local 
standards and regulations. The previously mentioned 
supervisory committee not only holds quarterly 
meetings but also supervises aﬀairs in connection 
with labor's retirement reserve fund. To meet legal 
requirements for disclosure of ﬁnancial reporting 
and ensure suﬃcient funding levels, TSMC makes 
contributions based statutory requirement and also 

engages an actuarial consulting ﬁrm to assess the 
valuation of the deﬁned beneﬁt plan. Please refer to 
Please refer to page 43-46 of the attached ﬁnancial 
report in the Company's 2022 annual report for 
details. Thanks to the Company's sound ﬁnancial 
condition, it is able to ensure the future viability 
employees' retirement beneﬁts and solid pension 
contributions and payments, which encourages 
employees to make long-term career plans with and 
further deepen their commitment to TSMC.

New Employee Orientation and 
Retention

To assist new employees to retain their jobs and 
quickly ﬁt into the workplace, orientation training 
was launched in 2022 for newcomers who have 
worked for at least four months but less than one 
year. Inspired by the theme of workplace ecology, 
workplace communication, and stress regulation, 
the physical course Success for Newcomers in the 

Workplace and the online broadcast Soft Power in 
the Workplace were launched. In total, 17 sessions 
of Success for Newcomers in the Workplace were 
conducted with 501 participants, achieving a post-
class evaluation score of 97 points. For Soft Power in 
the Workplace, professional psychological counselors 
were invited to share with new employees how to 
regulate stress, adopt a growth mindset, as well as 
coping methods for challenges and setbacks based 
on their personal experience. Nearly 1,300 people 
participated in the program, achieving an average 
post-class evaluation score of 94 points.

In addition to training, the WeCare Survey was 
launched in August 2022 to help new colleagues 
adapt to the workplace within one year of joining 
the Company. The survey includes dimensions such 
as self-eﬃcacy, role clarity, social interaction, and 
understanding of the culture. Feedback is collected 
regularly every month and systematically analyzed 
to provide necessary assistance on time. After a pilot 

run of ﬁve months, the adaptability assessment score 
of new employees increased from 7.4 to 7.9 points. 
Since October of the same year, direct supervisors 
can use the online dashboard to keep track of the 
progress of new employees. In 2023, TSMC expects 
to launch the online robot Bonnie, which can quickly 
answer new colleagues' questions and help them 
integrate into company life seamlessly.

Maintain Healthy Turnover Rate

To ensure talent mobility and long-term growth, 
TSMC believes that a healthy employee turnover rate 
should be between 5 and 10%. In 2022, the total 
turnover rate was 6.7%, or 0.1 percentage points 
lower than that of 2021. The new hire turnover rate 
(<1 year) was 15.0%, or 2.6% lower than that of 
2021, indicating that new employee care measures 
implemented in 2022, such as the WeCare Survey, 
new employee orientation training, etc., helped retain 
employees.

Employees are the most important asset of TSMC. 
Besides encouraging colleagues to learn constantly 
and unleash their talents, TSMC also emphasizes the 
cultivation of their skills and ongoing development. 
Consequently, the Company integrates internal 
and external resources to provide employees with 
a world-class workplace as well as challenging, 
meaningful, and interesting jobs. In addition, the 
TSMC Employee Training and Education Procedures 
have been formulated. In 2022, the TSMC Talent 
Development Model was formulated to materialize 
the two major strategies of Equipping Employees 

with Future Capabilities as well as Unleashing 
Employees' Potential and Innovation based on 
core attributes, in turn developing an ability-based 
learning program and a diverse and versatile 
learning approach. Complemented by various 
training and development programs at all levels, the 
Company aims to equip colleagues with capabilities 
that will be needed in the future in advance, 
actively implement comprehensive talent pipeline 
management, and enable employees to engage 
in lifelong learning with goals, plan and discipline, 
thereby becoming a force to uplift the society.

To accommodate the needs of operational growth, 
TSMC values the pre-training of employee capabilities 
and talent pipeline management. This is to ensure that 
when there is a mission, positions can be ﬁlled with 
suitable talent immediately to support the Company's 
rapid development. In 2022, 88 new organizations 
were added and the review of talent pipeline for fab 
directors/directors reached 69%. Through the talent 
pipeline, the Company can systematically formulate a 
detailed talent development plan, focus on operational 
needs, and complete the Company's talent pool. 
To take fab director talent as an example, the one-
year Operations People Development Program 
(OPDP) emphasizes the four major learning themes 
of Problem Solving, Strategic Thinking, Systems 
Thinking, and Change Management. Through group 
learning, application case studies, experience sharing 
by vice presidents and senior fab directors, as well as 
mentoring and other plans, TSMC strives to enhance 
the knowledge of fab directors and train all-round 
talent. The participation rate was 100%.

In terms of manager talent pipeline management, the 
updated New Manager Program was launched in 2022. 
The program was attended by 1,255 persons, achieving 
a participation rate of 97% and a cumulative total of 
7,300 person-times. The Operation Engineers Training 
Committee (OETC) also plans training for engineers with 
diﬀerent jobs and levels, builds capability stages and 
learning roadmaps, and provides courses in regulations, 
technology, management, and personal eﬀectiveness 
to equip employees with the necessary skills for future 
development. The program was attended by 48,000 
persons, achieving a participation rate of 100% and a 
cumulative total of 380,000 attendees.

Ability-Based Learning Program

The TSMC Capability Model centers on the Core 
Attributes to deﬁne Functional Capabilities according 
to the characteristics of each organization. General 
Capabilities and Leadership Capabilities necessary 
for employees are also developed. These are 
divided into two categories, Managing Work and 
Managing People/Organization, and they are further 
divided into three levels: basic, intermediate, and 
advanced. This is complemented by organizational 
development diagnosis to oﬀer a series of learning 
and development plans.

70-20-10 Rule + Blended Learning Helps New Managers Adapt to 
Their Jobs More Quickly

As the number of employees continues to increase along with the 
diversiﬁcation of the workforce structure and composition, the 
management's responsiveness and functional development must 
also continue to evolve. TSMC has consolidated the 70-20-10 rule 
and the blended learning model to design a revised new manager 

training course to guide new managers in applying it to their work via 
three steps. Furthermore, real-time adjustments are implemented in 
response to feedback to optimize management skills at work on an 
ongoing basis. Please refer to TSMC's Diverse Learning Models Bolster 
Talent Development for more details.

Unleash Employees' Potential and 
Innovation

TSMC oﬀers a wide range of learning resources 
to provide colleagues with learning content and 
approaches that cater to the needs of individuals 
and organizations, hoping to improve their work 
performance and self-worth and engender a positive 
impact on the Company and society. In 2022, face-
to-face and online training were launched along 
with internal and external learning platforms, and 
employees' average annual learning hours reached 
69.5 hours, an increase of 42% compared with the 
previous year. The total training cost was NT$968 
million, equivalent to NT$13,000 per employee, an 
increase of 5.6 times relative to the year before.

TSMC measures the outcome using the four levels of 
evaluation of the Kirkpatrick Model: reaction, learning, 
behavior, and results. In 2022, TSMC conducted 
reactive evaluations for all courses hosted by 
Organization Planning and Development Oﬃce. The 
course design, lecturers, administrative services, and 
overall satisfaction level were evaluated. Employees 
gave a score of 96 for their overall recommendations. 
In terms of course eﬀectiveness, learning and behavior 
evaluations were completed for the majority of on-
the-job training held at the organization level, allowing 
learners to understand and apply the training to 
work; the outcome evaluation was based on the staﬀ 
performance management and development system, 
demonstrating the training beneﬁts by achieving the 
performance goals.

Diverse Learning Resources and Channels

TSMC's growth is closely tied to the learning and 
development of employees. Besides education and 
training courses that have signiﬁcant relevance to 
professional technology and functions, the Company 
applies skills as the foundation of development in order 
to cultivate employees' knowledge on an ongoing 
basis and strengthen the awareness of self-learning. 
Combined with the internal learning manual and 
external learning platform, TSMC launched more than 
16,000 diverse learning resources including online 
micro-classes, audio-visual storytelling, reading articles, 
and special broadcasts for colleagues to choose from 
at will. In 2022, over 152,279 colleagues partook in the 
program, accumulating 14,413 learning hours and 
achieving an overall satisfaction score of 93 points for 
the internal learning resources.

Cultivate Internal Instructors & Excellent 
Instructor Award

Talent is one of TSMC's key strategies for bolstering 
its competitiveness, and internal instructors have 
become an important impetus for facilitating the 
Company's talent cultivation through the sharing 
of personal knowledge and experience. Established 
16 years ago, the Excellent Instructor Award has 
recognized excellent internal instructors each year, 
hosting Trainer Power-Up Camp, inviting external 
trainers to share knowledge in the training ﬁeld; 
at the same time, encouraging other outstanding 
employees to join the ranks of our instructors and 
share their knowledge and experience for more 
eﬃcient training. In 2022, TSMC employees were 
trained over 300,000 times cumulatively with the 
help of over 1,680 internal instructors.

For me, being a trainer entails sharing my 
experience with trainees; the enthusiastic 
feedback of trainees enables me to 
examine my work and teaching from 
diverse angles and perspectives.

TSMC adopts the RBA Code of Conduct and the UNGPs 
approved by the United Nations Human Rights Council 
to manage the human rights issues of its operations, 
suppliers, and business partners, as well as formulate 
the Human Rights Policy. Furthermore, TSMC abides by 
the local laws and regulations of the global regions in 
which it operates and stipulates clear implementation 
guidelines for various human rights concerns in an 
eﬀort to minimize human rights risks.

Enforce the TSMC Human Rights Policy 

TSMC regards the Human Rights Policy as the 
overarching principle of human rights governance and 
aligns with international sustainability practices. As 
the scope of human rights-related issues is extensive, 
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
proposed a human rights framework with six major 

―

Labor Rights, Environmental Rights, 

dimensions
Voice & Participation, Gender Equality, Product 
Development, Advertising, Use of Products & Services, 
and Governance & Security
is complemented by a human rights risk matrix to 
identify salient human rights issues along the two 

with 99 indicators. This 

―

major axes of Severity and Likelihood, as well as to 
evaluate the potential impact of the human rights 
issues on the past, the present, and the future based 
on the three major factors of Scale, Scope, and 
Irremediability.

In 2022, TSMC launched the survey of salient 
human rights issues using the UNDP's human 
rights framework. A total of 73 managers and 
colleagues participated in the identiﬁcation of 
human rights issues; the members included ESG 
committee members, the heads of sustainability 

reports of various organizations, and ESG 
representatives. The importance and impact of 
various human rights indicators on TSMC and 
its value chain were measured from a cross-
organizational perspective. Based on the 
investigation results, 11 salient human rights 

issues were identiﬁed along with the targets 
that are impacted by the issues, including TSMC 
employees, employees of suppliers, employees 
of contractors, customers, and the community. In 
2023, TSMC will use these results to build a cross-
unit human rights taskforce, which will follow 

the UNGPs framework to conduct due diligence, 
perform risk investigation and assessment, 
implement mitigation and remedial measures, 
launch human rights education and training, 
as well as disclose human rights management 
progress and goals to stakeholders.

Risk Assessment & Management

As a full member of the RBA, TSMC conducts 

Human Rights Protection Training

due diligence in compliance with the RBA Code 
of Conduct to ensure that TSMC either meets or 
exceeds the standard.

TSMC uses the RBA SAQ as a template to identify 
the practices, risks, and management systems of 
the four major aspects of labor, health and safety, 
environment, and ethics in business operations. In 
2022, all TSMC fabs in Taiwan scored 88 or more on 
the SAQ, which qualiﬁes as Low Risk (85 or higher 
is considered Low Risk). To comply with customer 
requests, TSMC also commissioned a third-party 
institute to carry out the RBA VAP for seven TSMC 
fabs, which all received full marks on the VAP. The 
complete audit report will be disclosed to customers 
and related stakeholders on RBA-Online.

opinions and complaints, including 19 through the 
Sexual Harassment Investigation Committee, 251 
through the Ombudsman System, one through the 
Whistleblower Procedures, and 83 cases through the 
Irregular Business Conduct Reporting System. All 
cases reported by employees were processed and 
addressed immediately and conﬁdentially.

● The Sexual Harassment Investigation Committee 

veriﬁed 14 cases of sexual harassment; the 
perpetrating employees were punished according 
to the severity of the situation, and the informers 
were oﬀered assistance programs including but 
not limited to psychological counseling. As the 
cases involved unwanted attention and verbal/
physical harassment, TSMC has added a section

Note 2: Cases reported through the Irregular Business Conduct Reporting System are from external parties and internal employees

what constitutes sexual harassment in the annual 
sexual harassment prevention courses. Moreover, 
the Company has reinforced the explanation of 
the new Stalking and Harassment Prevention Act 
in 2022, reminding employees that continuous or 
repeated surveillance, observation, stalking, and 
other behaviors constitute elements of harassment.

● There were four violations of business ethics and 
all employees have been punished or dismissed 
in compliance with the Company's regulations. 
TSMC continues to advocate important business 
ethics concepts in relevant training programs. In 
2022, 67,922 employees participated in the annual 
business ethics and regulatory compliance training 
(including Personal Data Protection Act-related 
contents), achieving a 99.9% completion rate.

Freedom of Association and Labor-
Management Meetings

To create a communicative workplace and enforce 
an open-style management system, oﬀer diverse 
internal communication channels, and respect 
employees' freedom of association, TSMC fabs in 
Taiwan regularly host labor-management meetings 
for 89.9% of the Company's global employees in 
compliance with local laws and regulations. TSMC 
management appoints a representative to explain 
recent developments in TSMC operations to employee 
representatives. At the meetings, management and 
employee representatives discuss topics of concern 
in an attempt to strengthen communication between 
management and employees.

In 2022, to promptly listen to the voices of employees, 
on top of the 13 existing fabs, TSMC went beyond 
legal requirements and subdivided non-fab 
colleagues into ten labor-management meetings with 
Organizations as the unit. Furthermore, the labor-
management meetings were renamed Silicon Garden 
Meetings to bring the Company and employees 
closer, and electronic voting was implemented to 
elect representatives from various organizations. 
Additionally, a feedback channel for Silicon Garden 
Meetings has also been created, allowing employees 
to entrust organization representatives to voice their 
opinions at labor-management meetings and convey 
their suggestions 24 hours a day. Such information 
is sent to the relevant units through the system 
immediately for them to respond.

Long-term Commitment

To realize the Human Rights Policy, TSMC has 
implemented the VAP of the RBA in all fabs. The 
Human Rights Related Issues have reached the 
faultless level as well as better governance and 
training on zero sexual harassment, zero workplace 
bullying, work hour management, human rights of 
disabled employees, and proprietary information 
protection. TSMC launched new training programs 
on Say No to Workplace Harassment, Workplace 
Bullying, and Proprietary Information Protection in 
2022 to educate management and employees about 
human rights. TSMC will also assemble a task force 
of experts to inspect processes and advise better 
practices for a concrete work plan on annual human 
rights protection plans from 2023 to 2030.

TSMC upholds the mission of Safety and Zero 
Accidents to monitor safety and health topics, 
develop digital disaster prevention measures, as well 
as control and monitor safety and health-related 
risks through artiﬁcial intelligence to build the best 
healthy workplace. Internally, the Corporate ESH 
Division is responsible for formulating the company-
level occupational safety and health management 
strategies and targets. Through a clear division of 
labor between various organizations within the 
Company, the division is in charge of promoting safety 
and health at all levels. Furthermore, the Occupational 
Safety and Health Committee convenes regularly to 
make sure safety and health management control 
are implemented in diﬀerent fabs in a bid to promote 

the health of workers. Externally, the Company 
collaborates with industry, government, academia, 
and supplier/contractor partners to prevent and 
lower the impact of occupational disasters, as well as 
to improve the safe and healthy work environment of 
the industry chain.

TSMC's Fab 12B Phase 8, Fab 18B Phase 1 to 3, and 
Advanced Backend Fab 6, which were completed 
in 2021, obtained ISO 45001 certiﬁcation for 
occupational safety and health management system 
and TOSHMS certiﬁcation in 2022. The remaining 
fabs and TSMC (China), TSMC (Nanjing), WaferTech, 
and VisEra have all obtained ISO 45001 certiﬁcation. 
At the same time, fabs in Taiwan will apply for 

separate TOSHMS certiﬁcations, where workers are 
requested to observe the management regulations 
through the management system. In response to the 
continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, pandemic 
prevention policies including stringent access control, 
reporting, and rapid case investigation mechanisms 
were proposed to reduce manpower and case 
investigation time, as well as to control group 
activities. Furthermore, beneﬁts such as employee 
vaccination or family care leave were established, and 
a group operation model was adopted based on the 
content and needs of the work involved. During the 
peak period of the pandemic, the maximum single-
day manpower loss was controlled below 2.9% to 
maintain normal operations. 

In 2022, the number of contractors visiting TSMC 
reached a new record of 49,628 people per day. In light 
of the improving pandemic situation and to commend 
outstanding contractors, supervisors, and industrial 
safety personnel, TSMC hosted a Communication 
Meeting for ESH Supervisors of Contractors. Moreover, 
the latest revision of the Blue Book for Contractors' 
Safety, Health and Environmental Protection was 
published to help contractors further understand 
safety and health codes, so as to strive towards 
the target of "zero incidents and zero occupational 
accidents."

Promote Safety Culture

Following the TSMC Safety and Health Policy, TSMC 
has implemented the following health and safety 
measures and used the Safety Performance Index 
(SPI) to track performance. TSMC has strengthened 

employees' safety and health awareness through 
training, hoping to minimize the impact of 
unsafe environments or conduct. An analysis of 
employee disabling injury statistics reveals that 

most injuries are caused by insuﬃcient safety 
awareness and failure to implement management 
regulations. To enhance safety culture, experts 
were commissioned to conduct a safety culture 

investigation in 2022, helping to identify the 
direction and improvement measures.

Case Study

Discover Opportunities for Continuous Improvement through the Safety Culture Investigation

Safety culture is the consensus among workers on safety awareness, emphasis, and belief in the 
workplace, and it is also the foundation of a safe and healthy workplace. In 2022, TSMC commissioned 
a professional international safety culture consulting ﬁrm to design a questionnaire based on four 
aspects: teamwork, safety communication, safety values, and organizational trust. Focusing on 
plants with "a disabling injury frequency rate and a disabling severity rate that have fallen below the 
Company average" for three consecutive years, a frontend wafer processing plant and a backend chip 
packaging plant were chosen via sampling. The survey targets included colleagues of production and 
non-production units, covering diﬀerent genders, age groups, seniorities, and grades; a total of 2,568 
questionnaires were sent out, and 1,776 valid questionnaires were retrieved, resulting in a response rate 
of 69.2%.

According to the analysis outcome, TSMC's safety culture was given a score of 4.8 points, indicating the 
Company is transitioning from being "compliant" to "incorporating safety awareness into our values". 
The top three topics of concern among the colleagues were "intrinsically safe work environment, 
comprehensive and transparent safety-related reporting procedures, and a team culture of looking out 
for each other". The most recognized measures were "feeling the management's high level of safety 
concern, quick adoption of improvement measures, ongoing work environment optimization, and 
understanding the importance of employees' physical and mental health" The least satisﬁed aspects 
were "the supervisor fails to proactively communicate safety-related topics, the employees believe that 
they do not have the proper ability to cope with management-related contingencies, the Company is 
advised to provide more safety awareness training."

To respond to the colleagues' topics of concern, the emphasis in 2023 will be placed on "reinforcing 
employees' day-to-day safety awareness, safety communication, and developing diverse safety awareness 

training." Corporate ESH Division will identify potential risks in the workplace and design bespoke safety 
and health training programs; design Safety Moment programs to train seed personnel from various units; 
publish new safety-related knowledge every month to elevate everyone's safety awareness; demand various 
departments to hold monthly workplace safety and health-related problem discussions, where the seed 
personnel will report improvement suggestions back to the Corporate ESH Division in a bid to establish a 
company-wide safety culture.

Safety Performance Index  

TSMC Safety Performance Index (SPI) is classified 
into four levels, including active and passive indices.  
The active indices encourage employees to 
participate in health and safety activities while 
the passive index shows the number of safety-
related failures, false alarms, etc. To implement 
the improvement measures for the prevention 
of false alarms, if the same false alarm occurs 
repeatedly in the same year, additional points 
will be deducted from the SPI. In 2022, blue-
light indices (excellent) increased by 10.1% from 
2021 to 86%. The main improvement in the 
passive indices was reflected in the decrease in 
false alarms from 28 incidents in the previous 

years to 17 incidents this year, and the incident 
rate per 1,000 employees was reduced to 0.145 
from 0.252 in 2021. When a false alarm occurs, 
in addition to applying the 3L5W (Three-Legged 
Five Whys) Tool to conduct an investigation, the 
Company also interviews relevant personnel, 
analyzes and inspects the equipment, and tests 
the materials using the false alarm reporting and 
investigation procedure. Relevant documents 
and records are checked, or the scene is 
reconstructed to identify the direct, indirect, and 
fundamental cause of the incident to actively 
discover improvement opportunities and prevent 
similar incidents from occurring again.

False Alarm Improvement Highlights in 2022

Reduce Fire Alarms

Reduce Gas Alarms

 Reduce Injuries 

Two false ﬁre alarms were caused by the 
activation of a machine's CO2 warning system; 
one ﬁre alarm was caused by an aging heating 
element of the cleaning tank; one incident of a 
static electricity-induced ﬁre caused by the use 
of ﬂammable chemicals on the machine

Three incidents were caused by damaged 
gas early warning alarm components, and 
three incidents were caused by workers who 
did not observe the gas cylinder replacement 
procedures. In all six incidents, the special gas 
was shut down immediately after the gas early 
warning alarm was triggered, hence it did not 
leak into the environment to cause personnel 
casualties or environmental pollution

Improvement Measures

Improvement Measures

● Record gas cylinder changes with 5G 
cameras, require on-site personnel to 
conduct steel cylinder replacement training 
every quarter to strengthen compliance with 
SOPs and operational proﬁciency

Nine injuries were mainly caused by contractors' unsafe conduct 
such as lack of safety awareness or failure to follow SOPs

Improvement Measures

● Construction site safety management is conducted through the 
three strategies of risk identiﬁcation, management support, and 
execution review. The digital transformation of occupational 
safety and health training is implemented, where relevant 
programs are launched by the TSMC Supplier Sustainability 
Academy. In particular, high-risk operation contractors must 
complete 100% of the training before entering the fabs to 
begin construction. As of December 2022, 21 occupational 
safety and health programs were completed by more than 
200,000 people

TSMC conducts hazardous gas leakage response drill through Virtual 
Reality (VR)

● To increase the safety of changing gas 

● To bolster contractors' safety awareness, the TSMC Contractor 

cylinders containing hazardous gases, in 
2023 TSMC will develop VR environments 
or objects that are combined with visual 
eﬀects and auditory information to improve 
the operational proﬁciency of on-site 
workers through gesture interaction and 
understanding intention

ESH Bluebook was converted into an audio book, and the 
operation safety management regulations for mechanical 
equipment including threading machines, sheerleg cranes, and 
suspended cages for window cleaning were added

● Interactive promotional safety awareness animation videos were 
produced for the cleaning personnel, which include examples of 
unsafe operations and unsafe environments to improve learning 
results

● Unsafe environments prone to injuries and falls were improved 
by installing safety signs on the aisles to minimize the risk of 
tripping; warnings and warning lines were added on the edges 
of the dock area to remind people of falling risks

TSMC builds VR room for compound disaster simulation training to 
enhance resilience  

168

● The safety design of the cleaning tank 

must include low-liquid level detectors and 
overheat detectors that are not controlled 
by the process. When the detectors are 
activated, they should be able to automatically 
turn oﬀ the heater; when the overheat 
detector circuit is open and faulty, it should 
be regarded as an alarm, and the heater is 
automatically turned oﬀ. This regulation has 
been included in the machine procurement 
and safety inspection standards, and new 
machines must pass the safety inspection 
before they can be used

● Static protection for valves using chemicals

Case Study

Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) Job Hazard Analysis Technology Enhances Workplace Safety

To enhance the implementation of the construction personnel's safety regulations, minimize 
inattention-related occupational disasters, and improve inspection manpower allocation and time-
consuming problems, TSMC has joined forces with National Chung Hsing University's Department 
of Management Information Systems in 2021 to develop Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) Job Hazard 
Analysis Technology, integrating existing emergency response 4G cameras in the fabs with a 
wired or wireless network to transmit live images, apply intelligent identiﬁcation technology to 
identify environmental and operational risks, as well as integrate big data computing and machine 
learning to monitor high-risk workplaces. The Emergency Response Center personnel can monitor 
safety blind spots via live images around the clock. When construction workers operating in high-
risk areas exhibit unsafe behaviors or ﬁnd themselves in an unsafe environment, text messages 
or the public address system can be used to report the problem to TSMC project managers and 
Emergency Response Center, demanding the contractor to make immediate improvements. The 
contractor may only resume construction after it has passed re-inspection.

In 2022, the AI job hazard analysis technology was used in Fab 15A to monitor 1,402 ceiling 
operations, where three unsafe contractor behaviors were discovered in time during the test 
process to prevent occupational injuries. Besides the ceiling, AI job hazard analysis technologies 
will be developed for other high-risk workplaces. The technology will be introduced to various 
fabs, and it will be standard equipment for new fabs. Considering the diverse applications of AI 
technology, TSMC formed an internal image recognition development and review platform in 2022 
to consolidate all AI image recognition system developments. Units with image recognition needs 
can search and utilize the application resources that have already been developed on this platform 
to expand the scope and depth of disaster prevention technology.

Statistical Analysis of Disabling Injuries 
among Employees  

Disclosure of occupational accidents is based 
on the Occupational Safety and Health Act and 
important disabling injury indicators issued by 
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which uses 
Disabling Severity Rate (SR) and Disabling Injury 
Frequency Rate (FR) as primary indicators. In 
2022, there were 35 disabling injuries among 
employees with 385 workdays lost. Of these, 21 
cases of disabling injuries among men resulted 
in the loss of 251 workdays, and 14 cases of 
disabling injuries among women resulted in the 

loss of 134 workdays. The employee injury rate 
was 0.05%. Men suﬀered from a higher number 
of work-related disabling injuries and workdays 
lost than women. The types of injuries were 
mostly falls and impact injuries, mainly caused by 
accidental collisions due to poor route design or 
failure to pay attention to people in front when 
using trolleys; or tripping injuries caused by the 
improper placement of materials when conducting 
machine maintenance operations.

Improvement Measures

Mostly caused by colleagues using trolleys in the 6" and 8" fabs. Therefore, trolley routes 
and placement locations continue to be planned according to the operations involved, 
reﬂectors are installed in areas prone to collisions, and colleagues who voluntarily report 
incidents are rewarded. Unsafe environments were improved and quarterly communication 
meetings were conducted in the manufacturing department to promote preventive safety 
awareness using diﬀerent themes. In 2023, trolley operation-related training videos will be 
recorded to improve learning performance

Mostly caused by missing a step in the clean room or tripping over objects during machine 
maintenance. Consequently, the 6S standard for maintenance processes has been 
formulated, including guidelines for placing relevant components, materials, and covers 
during machine maintenance, as well as rules for ﬁxing extension cords and trolleys. In 
addition, speciﬁcations for the steps on the machines in the clean room and the regulations 
for using them have also been deﬁned

Advanced Employee Health Check-up and Follow-up Care

According to the World Health Organization's statistics on 
the top ten causes of death, cerebrovascular diseases, heart 
diseases and cancer are the primary causes of disability and 
death. To enhance employees' health care, besides implementing 
health checks that comply with laws and regulations in TSMC 
fabs in Taiwan and Nanjing, the Company also collaborated with 

hospitals in 2022 to provide employees with advanced imaging 
examinations for cerebrovascular disease, heart disease, 
cancer (intestine/lung/breast), and other diseases by applying 
a standard that is superior to regulations, hoping to adopt a 
more proactive approach to detect abnormalities in advance 
and assist employees to receive early treatment. Moreover, the 

inspection results are combined with personal work hazards and 
applied to the physical and mental health management plan to 
actively mitigate employees' health risks. In 2022, 46,672 people 
received health check-ups, and for those who have abnormal 
results, all immediate assisted them back to hospitals for 
recheck and further treatment.

Comprehensive Health Care Service to Look after the Health of 
Contractors and Partners

In 2022, TSMC's safety and health management measures 
were extended to all workers including employees, contractors, 
suppliers, and construction site contractors. Furthermore, two 
major measures Environmental Safety Protection and Labor 
Physical and Mental Care were implemented for work sites. First 
of all, technological tools were introduced to manage construction 

site safety and address environmental risks, and prevent personnel 
from being exposed to unsafe environments. Second, the 
emphasis is on people, where health and screening services have 
been extended to construction sites, and a care group has been 
formed to protect the safety and health of contractors in the fab 
construction.

Construction Site Management Process and Mechanism

As TSMC values construction site safety, the 
Company vigorously aims to create a localized, 
people-oriented workplace, hiring only employees 
of local nationality. Since the start of a new 
construction project, a construction site safety 
management organization is formed with the 
contractors, construction site Occupational Safety 
and Health Committee, and Safety Management 
Center. TSMC rigorously monitors the construction 
environment using a comprehensive three-level 

management system, requiring contractors to 
submit a Construction Safety Protection Plan 
before each construction project, as well as discuss 
and review safe construction steps through 
the Safety Management Center and contractor 
meetings. In particular, before implementing the 
six high-risk operations, it is necessary to assign 
dedicated personnel to conduct a pre-construction 
inspection and full-time supervision to ensure 
labor safety.

The three-level management system continued at TSMC fab construction sites

In 2022, TSMC collaborated with third-party 
safety experts to implement the Construction 
Safety Management Counseling Project. Besides 
conducting on-site safety management operation 
observations and interviewing contractor supervisors 
in the workplace, the Company also strove to 
enhance contractors' attitudes towards safety 
management. Furthermore, a new project contractor 
operation safety improvement meeting was held, 
inviting TSMC's long-term contractors to participate 
in the meeting. At the same time, the American 

company DuPont and German company Exyte 
were invited to share their industry-leading safety 
management experience, encouraging contractors 
to generate the core value of "zero occupational 
safety accidents". The Company also required the 
management team to commit to creating a safety 
culture that involves full participation. The primary 
goal of the fab construction area was to reduce 
the risk of occupational risks. The program saw the 
participation of a total of 49 contractors and 140 
personnel.

● Established a health management system for high-risk 

● Carried out safety inspections of high-risk tools by professional personnel 

construction groups, where blood pressure monitoring, on-site 
care, and health education are carried out to implement voluntary 
health management in conjunction with contractor counselors. A 
total of 8,836 persons received care through this program
● Education is the foundation of safe behavior, hence teaching 

materials for 16 courses were integrated with the safety topics 
selected by seed instructors trained by contractors to implement 
exhaustive inspection via the three-level audit method to discover 
various contractor management-related weaknesses and oﬀer 
guidance

to ensure they were safe before entering the fab and using the tools

● Utilized AI image recognition technology to analyze personnel behavior 

patterns and build an abnormal environmental image model to interpret 
and prevent abnormal or illegal behaviors in the work area in real time

● Created an independent QR code at every opening in the construction 
area for patrolling purposes. A total of 1,382 openings were listed for 
management, achieving 100% protection

development and establish a reliable support 
network, TSMC collaborated with domestic and 
overseas R&D institutions to expand University 
Programs and provide assistance to address 
inadequacies in emergency relief and pandemic 
relief resources. Moreover, the Company teamed 
up with TSMC Education and Culture Foundation 
and TSMC Charity Foundation to form a protective 
shield for underprivileged groups via collaboration 
between industry, government, and academia. TSMC 
Education and Culture Foundation is dedicated 

to empowering youths, guiding female students 
to explore the ﬁeld of science, and enriching 
cultural heritage. By joining forces with educational 
institutions to empower teachers and shape the 
quality of students, TSMC fosters art recognition 
and heritage, elevating the spiritual cultivation of 
the Taiwanese people. TSMC Charity Foundation has 
connected rural education with local employment, 
appealing to employees and charity partners across 
various industries to support remote townships and 
seniors living alone to promote ﬁlial piety and create 
a society of common good, where children can grow 

up, young people can apply their talents, and seniors 
can retire.

In 2022, TSMC and the two Foundations invested 
more than NT$1.779 billion in charitable activities. 
NT$516 million was used to purchase and donate 
vaccines to alleviate the urgent domestic demand for 
vaccines. TSMC also invested more than NT$1.263 
billion into seven major public welfare pillars to 
promote various projects, listen to, support, and 
empower stakeholders in the social ﬁeld, mainly 
in the form of resources and services, which 

accounted for 64.8% of total donations. In terms of 
the type of resources invested, TSMC continues to 
strengthen contributions to commercial initiatives 
and community investments, hoping to strengthen 
the relationship with the community by focusing 
on the Company's core business. Concerning 
the UN SDGs, SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and 
Infrastructure) accounted for 55.6% of the resources 
invested during the year, followed by SDG 4 (Quality 
Education) at 17.3%. TSMC also paid attention to 
SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG 13 (Climate 
Action), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

Journeys of Female Scientists - Inspire Students' Interest in 
Science

Micro-course Design Helps Students Obtain New Knowledge of 
Semiconductors

To subvert the concept of "STEM is not suitable for women" and inspire senior high 
school girls' interest in science, TSMC Education and Culture Foundation collaborated 
with National Museum of Natural Science in 2022 to hold the third TSMC Journeys 
of Female Scientists, inviting students from 12 girls senior high schools to attend 
the lectures. The lectures included a guided tour of the World of Semiconductors 
Exhibition Hall and the TSMC Museum of Innovation. Semiconductor popular science 
workshops were also held in conjunction with lectures by female scientists. At the 
same time, outstanding female engineers from TSMC also shared their learning and 
career experience to encourage students to explore STEM. In 2022, TSMC Education 
and Culture Foundation extended the one day visit to two days and one night in-
depth popular science activity, hoping to encourage more female students to join 
scientiﬁc research, thereby cultivating scientiﬁc talents for the country and the 
industry. As of 2022, 17 Journeys of Female Scientists Lectures have been held and 
attended by 3,225 people.

In 2022, easy-to-understand micro-course teaching materials were used to 
encourage high school students to learn the ﬁeld of semiconductors, TSMC 
Education and Culture Foundation used sponsored exhibits from the World 
of Semiconductors Exhibition Hall of the National Museum of Natural Science 
to launch the Big Brother and Sister Talk About Semiconductors course in 
collaboration with NYCU. The course content encompasses semiconductor 
introduction, manufacturing process, component digital circuit, industry overview, 
etc. They are combined with Artiﬁcial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) experience and 
a short ﬁlm competition on semiconductor chip theory to inspire high school 
students' interest in semiconductors. The courses have been progressively 
launched at National Hsinchu Senior High School, National Hsinchu Girls' Senior 
High school, and National Experimental High School at Hsinchu Science Park with 
260 participants in total.

Female students enthusiastically partake in TSMC Journeys of Female Scientists Lectures

Technology is an integral part of people's 
lives, and there are semiconductors 
everywhere. I hope to continue to explore 
developments in semiconductors in my 
future career.

Taipei First Girls' High School Student

By having more female scientists as role 
models, young students can understand that 
the future path is not as diﬃcult as they may 
think, and it also helps children to enter the 
technology industry with more conﬁdence.

Cultivate Young 
Generation

What We Want to Solve
Domestic education often lacks literature, 
art, science, and exploration courses. As 
a result, students do not have a holistic 
education that integrates technology and 
humanities and thus lack the comprehensive 
skills required for future talents.

How We Respond
Organize competitions, science camps, 
lectures, and proposal competitions for 
senior high school and college students to 
inspire their interest in science and develop 
their cultural qualities. At the same time, the 
aim is to boost their self-conﬁdence, insight, 
and problem-solving capabilities.

Our Actions
● Promote Popular Science Education and 

Cultivate Female Scientist Talents

● Provide Diverse Platforms for Youths to 

Undergo Self-exploration

● Organize Literature, Arts, and Cultural 

Competitions to Enrich Cultural Qualities

What We Want to Solve
Schools in remote townships in the country 
are faced with long-term shortage of teachers 
and educational resources, resulting in low 
academic achievement among students. 
Students from underprivileged homes are 
trapped by ﬁnancial circumstances, hence 
they are unable to explore and turn their lives 
around.

How We Respond
Collaborate with educational organizations 
from both the private and public sectors 
to expand curriculum development and 
promotion, as well as assist in the training 
of teachers in remote townships to improve 
the learning motivation and eﬀectiveness of 
underprivileged students. Scholarships are 
also provided for disadvantaged students to 
reduce their ﬁnancial burden.

Cultural Nourishment through Literature 
Camp

Caring about remote education in Taiwan as its long-
term goal, TSMC Education and Culture Foundation 
collaborated with Cheng Zhi Foundation to transform 
rural education in Taiwan. In 2022, the Foundation 
continued to provide funding to Emei Bilingual 
Junior High School and help to transform it into an 
experimental junior high school for the third straight 
year, introducing changes to the teaching quality and 
learning performance through abundant teacher 
training and the implementation of professional 
course preparation resources. With the long-term 

resources contribution, the results of the Comprehensive 
Assessment Program for Junior High School Students 
show the ratios of English, mathematics, and social 
subjects that need to be improved are all lower than the 
previous year. Additionally, the number of students in the 
school has also increased steadily, from 39 in 2020 to 54 
students. In the same year, the Foundation collaborated 
with UNITAS Magazine to organize the second TSMC 
Youth Student Literature Camp at Emei Bilingual Junior 
High School. Through the exciting sharing of writers, 
62 young literature enthusiasts from Taoyuan, Hsinchu, 
and Miaoli were allowed to get close to literature and 
cultivate their word perception and writing skills. 

Provide Scholarship and Digital Learning 
equipment to Underprivileged Students

Dedicated to assisting outstanding yet economically 
underprivileged students, TSMC Education and Culture 
Foundation continued to contribute NT$9.8 million 
of scholarships to 98 underprivileged students in 
2022. In addition to scholarships, the Foundation also 
provided summer internship opportunities at TSMC for 
scholarship recipients to learn about industry trends 
and bridge the gap between learning and practice; the 
program also sponsors 25 award-winning freshmen 
with laptop computers to eliminate their digital 
learning barriers.

Thanks to the scholarship, I was able to go to 
Kenya to become an international volunteer 
without ﬁnancial worry, and gradually ﬁnd my 
calling. On the shoulders of a titan such as 
TSMC, I could see the light of my own future.

Practical Chinese Opera Learning - Shattering Traditional Frameworks

In 2022, TSMC Education and Culture Foundation joined forces with National 
Symphony Orchestra and Taipei National University of the Arts to sponsor the 
Music without Borders Educational Program, to connect  Taiwans music scene 
to the international stage and vigorously cultivate  world-class music talents. 
The One-Minute Symphony Composition Project recruited young composers to 
engage in quick creation. German conductor Jun Märkl was invited to mentor the 
young composers and their composing works were then performed by the NSO 
orchestra. The performance was appreciated by an audience of 5,973 people; For 
the Conducting and Composing Advancement Project, Lu Shao-Chia, a well-known 
Taiwanese conductor residing in Europe, helped aspiring students to reﬁne their 
conducting skills. The TNUA Orchestra Fall-Winter Concert 2022, was held and  
attracted an audience of 410 people.

To promote the heritage of Chinese opera, the Education and Culture Foundation teamed up 
with Guoguang Opera Company in 2021 to launch the Chinese Opera on Campus Program, 
opening Chinese opera elective courses at National Tsing Hua University and National 
Tunghai University. The courses consisted of Chinese opera-related knowledge, opera script 
appreciation and analysis, Peking opera performance demonstration and teaching; the class 
attracted 35 students to sign up since the beginning of the ﬁrst semester in 2021, and the 
number increased to 95 in 2022. To deepen collaboration and facilitate the appreciation of 
Peking opera, the Foundation also launched TSMC Theatre at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung 
University to perform classic opera repertoires. Furthermore, campus micro-courses were also 
held at three senior high schools in Hsinchu area, where wonderful, guided introductions were 
arranged in conjunction with live demonstrations by professional actors, taking students to 
transcend time and space. The performances attracted 644 participants in 2022.

The Foundation has sponsored the Tainan City Cultural Aﬀairs Bureau 
to hold the TSMC Youth Theater Project - 16 Year Old Festival since 
2015. The program theme is inspired by the 16 Years Old Coming of 
Age Ceremony, a traditional custom in Tainan, which combines three 
major strategies of "viewing theater, making theater, and performing 
theater" to bring youths closer to traditional customs and enrich their 
artistic cultivation. In 2022, youths are encouraged to portray the 
life of the younger generation through narrative history theater and 
montage-style directing. The program attracted 54 students from 25 
high schools in Taiwan to attend in 60 performances, and a total of 
39,512 people participated in the promotional activities. The 16 Year

in Hsinchu, Taichung, and Tainan. In 2022, the theme was A Feast of 
the Gods. A series of activities including drama, music, literature, history 
lectures, and online ﬁlm exhibition were held around the theme. The 
Foundation invited Peking opera masters to integrate technology with 
traditional art, collaborating with the National Symphony Orchestra, Taiwan 
Film & Culture Association, Guoguang Opera Company, and other art and 
cultural groups to take the audience to appreciate the cultural connotation 
of Chinese and western myths through exquisite art performances.158,145 
participants joined 15 oﬄine and 27 online events in total.

To enhance the public's appreciation of classical music, TSMC Education 
and Culture Foundation sponsored National Taichung Theater and 
New National Theatre, Tokyo to launch Mozart's opera The Magic Flute. 
Darrel Ang, the artistic director of Sichuan Symphony Orchestra and a 
renowned Singaporean conductor, was invited to collaborate with the 
National Symphony Orchestra and numerous top international vocalists 
for four performances at the National Taichung Theater. Activities such as 
performances, lectures, workshops, and stage tours enable the audience 
to gain insight into the details of opera creation. A total of 7,825 people 
participated in the event.

Tales from Chinese Opera program interview

To deepen the younger generation's knowledge in Chinese opera, convey 
Chinese opera knowledge and classical Chinese literature through auditory 
sense the Education and Culture Foundation continued to collaborate 
with IC Broadcasting Company in 2022 to launch the opera broadcasting  
program Tales from Chinese Opera. Every week, the program introduces 
the provenance of classic operas and their performance styles. The 
program also interviews famous Peking opera actors and introduces 
the exciting on-stage and behind the scenes stories of Peking opera in a 
humorous manner, as well as oﬀers diverse channels for listeners. As of 
2022, more than 863,533 people have listened to the online program.

Produce the Radio Program I-Yun Hsin Talks About the 
Classic of Poetry

TSMC Education and Culture Foundation invited Professor I-Yun Hsin, 
a master of Chinese studies, to produce a Chinese classic lecture radio 
program I-Yun Hsin Talks About the Classic of Poetry. Since 2018, he has 
taught classics such as the Analects, Zhuangzi, Mozi, and Laozi; in 2022, he 
selected contents from the Classic of Poetry to produce 43 episodes, using 
simple but vivid explanations to share emotional descriptions and social 
outlook in the Classic of Poetry. The program attracted a total of 692,075 
listeners.

Young people are invited to perform at the 16 Years Old Festival to showcase their passion and vigor

to gain a deeper understanding of 
traditional culture.

Power to Change Society

Dedicated to becoming a force for positive change 
in the society, TSMC Charity Foundation has long 
committed itself to championing four social causes: 
Empower the Rural Community, Care for the Elderly, 
Promote Filial Piety, and Protect the Environment. 
Adopting a hands-on approach to serving those 
in need, the Foundation leads TSMC employees in 
eﬀorts to care for members of society and engage 
with the government, industry and academia to jointly 
close the urban-rural gap in learning resources and 
support economically underprivileged groups.

In 2022, the Foundation primarily focused on 
Empower the Rural Community, matching rural 
education goals to students' employability skills. 
Partnering with enterprises with the same vision, the 

Foundation designed and oﬀered career exploration 
activities, technical and vocational training, and job 
matching services to ﬁll vacancies in industry and 
academia.

To play a part in Protect the Environment, the 
Foundation invested in initiatives that generate 
green energy for the good of the underprivileged. 
The Foundation installed solar power generators and 
replaced existing lights with energy-saving LED light 
tubes, saving and generating electricity at the same 
time. These measures have provided underprivileged 
groups with regular funding from generating green 
power and built classrooms with better lighting in 
schools in remote areas, while at the same time 
saving money on electricity bills.

A Variety of Education to Close the 
Resource Gap

In 2022, volunteers led by TSMC Charity Foundation 
continued visiting elementary schools in remote 
townships and NGOs providing after-school care to 
oﬀer students a variety of enjoyable and instructive 
activities and lessons, including picture book reading, 
post-processing in photography, and media literacy. 
Courses on enhancing the pedagogical skills of 
teachers in rural schools were also organized. In 
response to the Ministry of Education's focus on science 
education and hands-on inquiry in the 2019 Curriculum, 
the science games designed by the Foundation were 
combined with AI programming courses to cultivate 
students' scientiﬁc thinking skills. Working with National 
Yang Ming Chiao Tung University on the Programming 
Education Plan for Hsinchu County project, teachers 
and students residing in rural areas were taught how 
to utilize programs to solve life problems. During the 
pandemic, the Foundation distributed science learning 
materials and conducted science experiments online so 

students could learn remotely.

Encourage Career Exploration and Focus 
on Adaptive Development

To expand educational resources in rural townships 
and provide rural students with information about 
career choices, the Foundation has partnered with 104 
Job Bank since 2021 to launch the World of Jobs, Road 
to Employment website, on which interest quizzes 
based on the Holland Codes were introduced to help 
students learn about their personality traits. A total of 
104 vlogs featuring professionals from all walks of life 
were produced and featured on the website as valuable 
reference for students exploring career paths.

Technical and Vocational Training and 
Empowerment to Boost Employment

To encourage students to start their careers in their 
hometowns and ﬁnd a solution to workforce shortage, 
the Foundation in 2021 began to partner up with 
corporations to organize technical and vocational training 
events in rural areas. Through 30 hours of dynamic 
vocational training, some students were able to acquire 
specialized skills that landed them jobs straightaway. 
The Foundation also arranged for trained vocational 
high students in rural areas to bring after-school study 
services to local elementary schools and social welfare 
institutions, thereby building a successful mode of 
public welfare beneﬁcial to all parties. Collaborating with 
Microsoft Taiwan and several labor aﬀairs bureaus on 
Microsoft Oﬃce 365 skill enhancement program, the 
Foundation honed the Microsoft Oﬃce competency skills 
of disadvantaged youths and augmented the information 

education of rural teachers.

Call on Fellow Enterprises to Oﬀer Job 
Opportunities

Partnering with Semiconductor Equipment and Materials 
International Organization (SEMI), the Foundation held a 
lecture titled Technical and Vocational Talent Development 
in the Field of Semiconductors during SEMICON Taiwan 
2022, inviting members of industry, government and 
academia to share their perspectives on the advantages 
of pursuing higher education and employment. Appeals 
were made to the industry to analyze the structure of 
workforce costs, restructure internal positions, hire 
vocational high school students, and look for solutions 
to workforce shortage. The Foundation simultaneously 
worked on building a job matching platform on its 
World of Jobs, Road to Employment website, increasing 
employment opportunities and the range of job 
selections for technical and vocational high school talent.

Support the Lives of Underprivileged 
People

In collaboration with the departments of social aﬀairs 
of local governments, the Foundation launched 
the NT$10,000 Per Household and emergency aid 
programs to ﬁnancially support underprivileged 
families and families tackling emergencies. For rural 
and underprivileged farmers ending up with surplus 
produce due to lack of market information, TSMC 
volunteers help them out by way of harvesting, bulk 
order or sale, giving the earnings back to farmers 
or donating such surplus produce to social welfare 

institutions.

Support the Pursuit of Education and 
Operation of Institutions

To support hardworking students who can not 
aﬀord to go to school due to their families' ﬁnancial 
conditions, the Foundation oﬀered scholarships for 
underprivileged students on the recommendations of 
local departments of education and schools. With the 
help of the Sending Love platform, appeals were made 
to the public and corporations to make donations. 
In 2022, the Foundation funded six rural schools to 
participate in the School of Future Competencies: 
Initiative to Support Model Schools in Rural Areas 
Cultivating Reading Competencies project and installed  
distance learning equipment. In addition to purchasing 
items for learning purposes for rural students, the 
Foundation utilized the TSMC i-Charity platform to 
secure monthly donations of ﬁxed amounts and 
organize charity concerts for fundraising. All of these 
donations went to NGOs committed to long-term rural 
educational eﬀorts.

Strengthen the Care for Seniors Living Alone By Providing 
Much-needed Resources and Companionship

Through the Network of Compassion, the Foundation combines resources from 
medical and social welfare institutions to meet the needs of seniors living alone in 
rural areas, including oﬀering medical services, meal deliveries, and transportation 
vehicles, thereby reinforcing the quality and mobility of resources dedicated to 
caregiving in rural areas. Due to the rising need for providing long-term care in 
local communities, the Foundation in 2022 collaborated with Taipei Municipal Gan-
Dau Hospital and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University to build a new smart 
ﬁtness club for seniors. Smart workout devices adapted to train aging muscles were 
introduced to help prevent disability and delay aging.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, seniors aged 65 years and older were at high risk 
of severe illness. The Foundation provided long-term care institutions with pandemic 
prevention and control supplies and nutritional supplements to safeguard the 
health of seniors and caregivers. Although services requiring physical proximity were 
suspended, TSMC volunteers led handicraft activities through video conferencing, 
participated in empowering seniors through storytelling initiatives, and handed out 
heartwarming presents during holidays and festivals, enriching the lives of seniors 
residing in caregiving institutions. When the September 2022 Taitung earthquakes 
damaged many homes of seniors living alone and disadvantaged families, TSMC 
volunteers joined forces with providers and local governments to repair the 
damaged houses, employing their facility expertise and eﬃcient division of labor. 
Throughout the repair process, suﬃcient care was given to the everyday living 
spaces and environments of disadvantaged seniors and their supply of goods.

TSMC helping set up a smart ﬁtness club for seniors in the community 
can utilize the technology researched and developed by the university 
to measure precise health stats that will help seniors get the most out of 
their workouts.

services and facilities increases every year. 
Insuﬃcient resources pose a particular 
challenge to the health and well-being 
of senior citizens living in rural areas and 
seniors living alone.

How We Respond
Strengthen the Network of Compassion 
system to bring together medical and 
social welfare institutions and integrate and 
distribute long-term care resources from the 
government and social welfare institutions 
to oﬀer comprehensive and quality care to 
the seniors living in rural areas and seniors

Diversify Creative Eﬀorts to Instill the Virtue of Filial Piety

The Foundation continued working with the K-12 Education 
Administration under the Ministry of Education to organize parent-
child workshops on ﬁlial piety, drawing activities, and contests 
receiving entries on the subject of ﬁlial piety.  The teaching plans 
and demonstration videos of the parent-child workshops on 
ﬁlial piety developed by the Foundation were made available 
for educational agencies to download free of charge. Though 
storytelling activities by volunteers were suspended during the 
pandemic, the TSMC i-Charity platform was used to raise funds 
for pupils and their families in rural areas to watch family-themed 
movies on Mother's Day, in a bid to let children understand and 
appreciate the hard work of family caregivers, and to remind the 
latter to pay attention to their own health and well-being.

What We Want to Solve
The rapid advance of the digital era has 
caused generational estrangement and 
put the family support system at risk of 
becoming vulnerable. The traditional 
culture of ﬁlial piety has seen a gradual 
decline, with ever fewer people espousing 
and practicing the virtue.

How We Respond
Combining resources from industry, 
government and academia, and by way of 
educational materials, interactive activities 
and contests calling for entries, parent-child 
conversation is guided to achieve better 
understanding and to develop cohesion in 
families and harmony in society.

In the Foundation's eﬀorts to promote green energy, 
partnerships have been with local governments and 
social welfare institutions to sponsor the installation of 
solar panels on the rooftops of institutions. In 2022, the 
Foundation built seven solar power plants, reducing 
the monthly electricity bills of social welfare institutions. 
Through electricity wholesale based on feed-in-tariﬀ 
contracts, these institutions receive NT$2.76 million 
every year to fund their operations. To improve 
school lighting for elementary school students, the 
Foundation funded underprivileged students enrolled 
in vocational colleges to install LED energy-saving light 
tubes in 246 schools across Taiwan, saving as much as 
NT$9.61 million in electricity fees every year
enough 
to pay for 320,000 more school lunches. To help solve 
the problem of hunger and reduce food waste, the 
Cherish Food Project was launched, working with 
seven food businesses to distribute goodwill foods to 
130 underprivileged groups in 16 cities and counties, 
beneﬁting individuals 48,143 times.

What We Want to Solve
Climate change impacts the natural 
environment and threatens certain 
species. It particularly strains the support 
systems vital to underprivileged groups, 
calling into question the stability of such 
systems in the face of environmental 
disasters, inequalities in energy 
distribution, and malnutrition.

How We Respond
With a comprehensive focus on the 
environment, ecology and society, the 
Foundation works with industry, government 
and academia to devise plans that help 
underprivileged groups reduce resource 
waste and energy consumption and develop 
renewable energy sources. TSMC volunteers 
work on promoting environmental and 
energy conservation education.

The Foundation continued to lead TSMC volunteers to 
give diverse tours and oﬀer courses on environmental 
and energy conservation to raise awareness of 
environmental protection and sustainability among 
rural students and the general public. TSMC Ecology 
Volunteers, dedicated to the work of ecological 
preservation, invited and funded rural students to 
travel to TSMC's premises, where they were given an 
informative ecological tour. As part of the focus on 
environmental education, the students learned about 
biodiversity as well as water and energy conservation. 
Ecology Volunteers gave tours in Jacana Ecological 
Education Park to talk about conservation systems and 
introduced the public in the National Museum of Nature 
Science to semiconductor science and technology. In 
2022, the Foundation co-published the picture book 
Fen-Fen's Promise with Old Tree Yard Environment 
Protection Foundation, whose mission is to promote old 
trees, protect forests, and advocate for an eco-friendly 
education that views old trees as our friends.

Many thanks to TSMC for introducing 
students to how an eﬀective water recycling 
system works. It inspired them to care more 
about environmental protection issues and 
take action.

Corporate Governance

TSMC advocates and acts upon the principles of 
operational transparency and respect for shareholder 
rights. We believe that the basis for successful 
corporate governance is a sound and eﬀective 
Board of Directors. In line with this principle, TSMC 
Board of Directors set up the "Audit Committee" and 
the "Compensation Committee" in 2002 and 2003 
respectively. To continue to make our corporate 

governance more comprehensive, the TSMC Board 
took a step further in February 2023 to expand 
and strengthen the functions and responsibilities 
of its committees, including renaming the "Audit 
Committee" to the "Audit and Risk Committee", 
and the renaming the "Compensation Committee" 
to the "Compensation and People Development 
Committee". In addition, in order to strengthen the 

selection mechanism for directors, build diversiﬁed 
and professional board, TSMC's Board of Directors 
approved the establishment of the "Nominating, 
Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee" 
referencing international practices. Each Committee 
supports the Board to fulﬁll its responsibilities and 
each Committee's chairperson regularly reports to 
the Board on its activities and recommendations.

Board of Directors and Committees

Inheriting the spirit of TSMC's Founder, Dr. Morris 
Chang's philosophy on corporate governance, 
under the leadership of Chairman Dr. Mark Liu and 
CEO & Vice Chairman Dr. C.C. Wei, TSMC's Board of 
Directors takes a serious and forthright approach 
to its duties and is a dedicated, competent and 
independent Board.

Risk Management

TSMC adopts a balanced risk-reward approach to 
risk management to optimize business returns 
while considering the overall impact on corporate 
sustainability. In 2022, the Risk Management Policy 
was established, approved by the Board of Directors 
and signed oﬀ by the Chairman, aﬃrming the 
Company's commitment to a proactive and robust risk 
management system that assist TSMC in making well-
considered and risk-based decisions, thereby fulﬁlling 

the Company's ESG vision and actions and delivering 
sustainable value for TSMC and its stakeholders. To 
support the implementation of the Risk Management 
Policy, the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
framework was enhanced in 2022 to outline the risk 
management mechanisms, processes, systems and 
tools. Through a  5-step process of identiﬁcation, 
assessment, response, monitoring, and review, 
potential sustainability risks such as climate change, 
utility supply, earthquakes, ﬁres, and chemical spillage 
as well as emerging risks are managed. A series of 
training courses are provided to foster a  risk-aware 
mindset and culture.

TSMC further renamed the Audit Committee to Audit 
and Risk Committee in February 2023 to enhance 

the Board of Directors' risk oversight of TSMC's 
ERM framework. At the management level, the risk 
governance structure comprises the Risk Management 
Steering Committee, Risk Management Executive 
Council, Risk Management Taskforces, Central Crisis 
Command Center, and Crisis Management Team. 
Risk Management Division works with each function 
in applying the ERM framework to ensure that 
signiﬁcant risks and crises across TSMC are assessed 
and adequately mitigated. This is performed through 
risk monitoring, conducting workshops, visiting sites, 
participating in key meetings, and implementing risk 
related policies and guidelines. For more details on Risk 
Management, please refer to 6.3 Risk Management in 
TSMC's 2022 Annual Report.

Ethics and Regulatory Compliance

Ethics

"Integrity" is the cornerstone of TSMC's business 
philosophy. TSMC established its TSMC Ethics 
and Business Conduct Policy (Ethics Code) to 
be the guide for operating TSMC's business 
and to form a robust culture of integrity within 
TSMC, with "integrity, commitment, innovation 
and customer trust" as our core values.  At the 
same time, by establishing the Supplier Code of 
Conduct and Supplier Sustainability Standards, 
TSMC extends its core value of integrity into 
its supply chains and to enable suppliers to 
demonstrate business with integrity behavior. 
In addition, TSMC publishes its TSMC Anti-
Corruption Commitment on the TSMC website to 
emphasize TSMC's commitment to its core value 
of integrity.

TSMC established and published the Complaint 
Policy and Procedure for Certain Accounting 
& Legal Matters, making multiple reporting 
channels available for internal and external 
voices, and accepting anonymous reports to 
protect the rights and interests of the Company 
and its constituencies. All reported incidents 
collected from these reporting channels are 
properly recorded, confidentially investigated, 
well traced, and enhancements to TSMC 
practices are made where applicable. TSMC 
keeps individual identities confidential and 
prohibits any retaliation on any individual who 
in good faith reports a suspected violation or 
participates in an investigation. Furthermore, 
TSMC has an Ethics Committee that oversees 
the implementation of the Ethics Code and 
investigations and disciplinary actions for 

reported incidents. The Ethics Committee meets 
quarterly or whenever necessary. In 2022, the 
Ethics Committee met six times to examine major 

reported incidents under investigation. Four 
incidents were verified upon investigation and 
determined for disciplinary action by the Ethics 

Committee.  The Company will take progressive 
disciplinary actions according to the nature and 
severity of each misconduct.

Financial Performance

TSMC believes a strong ﬁnancial foundation is the 
key to corporate sustainability. Since the founding of 
the Company, TSMC has developed prudent business 
plans, adhered to disciplined capital management, 
and delivered solid ﬁnancial performance to help 
create long-term economic value, which allows the 
Company to give back to all its stakeholders, including 
shareholders, investors, employees, customers, 
suppliers/contractors, government/industry 
associations, society, and others, and to drive positive 
changes in society.

value. As the insatiable demand for computation will 
propel the continued drive for chip performance and 
a greater need for energy-eﬃcient computing, TSMC 
expects strong growth potential in its advanced and 
specialty technologies in the next several years. Thus, 
from 2021 to 2026, the Company expects its long-
term revenue growth, in US dollar terms, to have a 
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15 to 20%, 
with a long-term gross margin to be 53% and higher, 
and a return on equity (ROE) to be 25% and higher 
across the cycle.

In an eﬀort to better communicate with investors, 
TSMC strives to ensure the transparency and 
timeliness of its ﬁnancial information. In addition to 
the regular disclosure of its latest ﬁnancial results, the 
Company also sets clear and measurable strategic 
ﬁnancial objectives and continues to deliver results 
that are aligned with its long-term ﬁnancial targets. 
In doing so, TSMC is able to strengthen investors' 
conﬁdence in the Company's long-term investment 

Given the funding requirements to address the 
business growth opportunities and the need to 
maintain a solid ﬁnancial foundation, since 2020, 
TSMC has issued a total of NT$311.5 billion in NT 
dollar denominated corporate bonds and US$17.5 
billion in US dollar denominated corporate bonds with 
favorable pricing terms. Since the bond issuances, 
TSMC has continued to maintain the semiconductor 
industry's highest credit ratings.

Market Capitalization

Unit: NT$ trillion

Since TSMC went public in 1994, the Company 
has been profitable every year and its market 
capitalization has been growing steadily. As of 
December 31, 2022, TSMC's market capitalization 
reached NT$11.7 trillion, or US$379.7 billion.

TSMC's solid financial performance enables the 
Company to distribute profits to shareholders in 
the form of cash dividends. In June 2021, TSMC's 
Board of Directors approved the increase in 
quarterly cash dividend from NT$2.5 to NT$2.75 
per share. Therefore, TSMC's shareholders 

received a total of NT$11 per share in cash 
dividends in 2022. From 2004 to 2022, TSMC has 
paid out a total of NT$2.5 trillion, or US$81.5 
billion, in cash dividends.

In the future, TSMC intends to maintain a 
sustainable and steadily increasing cash 
dividend, and to distribute the cash dividend 
each year/quarter at a level not lower than the 
year/quarter before.

Tax

TSMC supports the government in formulating 
regulations that encourage enterprise innovation and 
foster economic growth.  The Company's tax policy is 
reviewed and approved annually by the Chief Financial 
Oﬃcer, which aims to ensure transparency and 
sustainability in the long term.

Tax Policy

  Act at all times in compliance with the spirit and 

the letter of all applicable tax laws and regulations 
in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

  Conduct inter-company transactions on an 

arm's length basis and in accordance with the 
internationally accepted transfer pricing guidance 
published by the OECD.

  Be transparent in ﬁnancial reporting, make 
disclosures in accordance with applicable 
regulations and reporting requirements.

  Do not use tax havens or tax structures whose sole 

purpose is tax avoidance.

  Do not transfer value created to low-tax 

jurisdictions.

  Develop strong, mutually respectful relationships 
with tax authorities based on transparency and 
trust.

  Always consider tax as a part of major business 

decisions.

  Analyze the operating environment and assess tax 
risk through a corporate management mechanism.

Tax Risk Management

TSMC is subject to tax laws and regulations in the 
various jurisdictions in which it operates or conducts 
business. Any unfavorable changes in tax laws and 
regulations in these jurisdictions could increase the 
Company's eﬀective tax rate and have an adverse 
eﬀect on its operating results. In order to eﬀectively 
manage tax risks, TSMC follows internal control 
processes, identiﬁes, assesses, and manages tax 
risks from regulatory changes and its business 
transactions, accounts for them appropriately, and 
implements and monitors controls over them.

Tax risk management is incorporated in TSMC's 
enterprise risk management (ERM) system. The 
risk management organization annually reports 
to the Audit and Risk Committee on TSMC's key 
risks and mitigation eﬀorts. For more details on 
risk management, please refer to the 6.3 Risk 
Management section in TSMC's 2022 Annual Report.

Tax Governance

The ultimate responsibility for the taxation 
management of TSMC and its subsidiaries rests 
with the Chief Financial Oﬃcer, who delegates day-
to-day responsibility to the Controller. A team of 
qualiﬁed and experienced tax professionals supports 

the Controller to meet TSMC's tax obligations. In 
addition, TSMC also leverages external tax service 
providers for complementary expertise.

TSMC's Audit and Risk Committee is delegated by 
the Board to oversee the quality and integrity of the 
accounting, auditing, reporting, and ﬁnancial control 
practices of the Company through periodic review of 
certain major matters, including accounting policies 
and procedures, internal control systems, legal 
compliance, and corporate risk management, etc. 
Among these, tax compliance is included as part of 
the Company's legal compliance.

Eﬀective Tax Rate

TSMC's eﬀective tax rate and cash tax rate in 2022 
were 11.1% and 7.6%, respectively, both of which 
were lower than the industry average eﬀective tax 
rate of 15.9% and the industry average cash tax rate 
of 14.12% based on S&P Global CSA Handbook in 
the Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment 
industry group, and also lower than Taiwan R.O.C. 
statutory tax rate of 20%. This was primarily due to a 
ﬁve-year tax exemption for capital investments made 
in previous years, and tax credit for research and 
development expenditures according to regulations 
under the R.O.C. Statute for Upgrading Industries 
and Statute for Industrial Innovation.

In 2022, over 90% of TSMC's revenue and

business operations in Taiwan. Meanwhile, 
over 90% of its tax payments were also made 
to the Taiwan R.O.C. government

Information Security

Information security and proprietary information 
protection (PIP) are TSMC's commitments to customers, 
suppliers, and employees. To strengthen corporate 
information security protection and management 
mechanisms, TSMC created the new role of Chief 
Information Security Oﬃcer in 2022 to take charge of 
information security policy and procedure planning, 
monitoring, and management. The Company also 
continues to perform information security risk analysis 
and develop smart information security technologies 
and measures, including cloud information security 
analysis, alarm summaries, the SOAR (Security 
Orchestration, Automation, and Response) system, etc., 
to improve protection and monitoring performance. 
TSMC is also inﬂuencing the supply chain by working 
with SEMI to overcome information security challenges 
in the semiconductor industry. Through four major 
directions, information security awareness and 
protection standards in the industry are raised to 
achieve the goal of sustainable operations.

by Sir Peter L. Bonﬁeld, an independent director 
with a background in information security. In 2022, 
following the regulations of the Financial Supervisory 
Commission of Taiwan, TSMC appointed J.K Lin, Senior 
Vice President of Information Technology, Material 
and Risk Management, to take on the addition role 
of Chief Information Security Oﬃcer (CISO). Lin is 
responsible for the overall planning and coordination 
of company resources, communicating on information 
security policies and directions. TSMC has established 
a dedicated information security organization 
(Corporate Information Security, CIS), led by Director 
James Tu, is responsible for the implementation, 

planning, monitoring, and management of information 
security operations. TSMC has also established 
the PIP and Cybersecurity Committee and the IT 
Security Committee to cooperate with the Company's 
information technology and related organizations to 
strengthen corporate information security protection 
and management mechanisms. Both committees are 
chaired by the CISO and comprise VP-level executives 
who meet regularly to review and deliberate on 
important information security and protection policies 
as well as project implementation. Every six months, 
the CIS executives report risk management measures 
to the Audit Committee, including global information 
security trends, corporate information security policies, 
plans, and implementation results. The chair of the 
Audit Committee also reports on the eﬀectiveness 
of information security supervision and risk control 

measures to the Board of Directors.

Implement Information Security 
Culture and Build Management 
Mechanisms

TSMC is fully committed to the TSMC Information 
Security Declaration and continues to work on the ﬁve 
major areas of information security management. Over 
the years, TSMC has consistently met the information 
security requirements of customers and third-party 
agencies. In 2022, TSMC's external audits concluded 
that no major information security ﬂaws, major 
violations, incidents of customer data breach and 
regulatory ﬁnes occurred. Moreover, there have been 
zero complaints concerning breach of customer privacy 
and loss of customer data from either third parties or 
regulatory bodies resulting in judicial action. By actively 
strengthening information security and PIP, TSMC hopes 
to safeguard market competitiveness and customers 
and partners' interests.

Perform Risk Assessment and Strengthen Information Security Measures

Strengthen Information Security Operations and Management 

TSMC regularly performs information security risk assessments and adopts a comprehensive layered 
cybersecurity defense. In 2022, information security measures focused on cybersecurity control, 
information asset management, access control and safety, and workplace security items to strengthen 
information security defense.

Major Information Security Items and Measures

Cybersecurity Control
● Enhance the security and convenience of web browsing, strength email security and 

protecting against phishing emails and malware

● Strengthen KPI management for cloud security posture management

Information Asset Management
● Introduce endpoint smart terminal protection to detect, analyze, and automatically respond 

to malware attacks

● Introduce zero downtime patching solutions to strengthen the protection of important 

servers

● Integrate automatic information security evaluation into the development process 

platform to improve application security

● Build information security designs into applications to strengthen security and repair 

weaknesses

Access Control and Safety
● Manage information by deﬁning diﬀerent levels and categories to bolster protection 

and access control

Workplace Security
● Install multi-layered workplace monitoring and detection equipment to ensure security 

control

TSMC has implemented the Business Continuity Management Policy to ensure business continuity. The 
24-hour Cybersecurity Incident Response Center (CIRC) is responsible for coordinating related eﬀorts 
and ensuring the eﬀectiveness of control measures in compliance with the information security incident 
notiﬁcation procedures. In 2022, new measures were added, including strengthening cloud information 
security analysis and alarm summaries for overseas facilities, introducing automatic response systems 
with preset responses that are automatically executed, etc. In addition, TSMC continues to organize 
cybersecurity drills, focusing in 2022 on ransomware, remote access, and weaknesses in overseas facilities. 
The Company also worked with third-party experts to conduct penetration testing and red team vs. 
blue team drills to enhance information protection and monitoring. In addition to internal measures to 
strengthen information security at TSMC, the Company recognizes that companies are currently facing 
dangerous landscapes and have, therefore, invested in information security insurance as the last line of 
defense to reduce risks of information security incidents.

Strengthen Supplier Information Security 

TSMC seeks to strengthen information security across the supply chain in four areas: ﬁrst, establishing 
standards; second, assessment & collaboration; third, advocacy; and fourth, risk management. In 2022, the 
information security practices of 659 suppliers were evaluated, of which 481 received a grade of A and 326 
suppliers were able to bring up their grades by one or more levels within six months. The reach of TSMC's 
Supply Chain Security Newsletter was also expanded. In 2022, four issues were published with a readership 
of 350,000. TSMC also assisted SEMI in establishing the SEMI Cybersecurity Committee. Chaired by Dr. 
James Tu, Head of Corporate Information Security at TSMC, the SEMI Cybersecurity Committee advocates 
information security solutions based on the zero trust model to strengthen supply chain resilience. In 2022, 
the Committee rolled out four major directions to strengthen information security in the industry, using 
third-party risk assessment tools to create the SEMI Semiconductor Cyber Security Risk Rating Service 
dedicated to semiconductor suppliers. The rating service can help suppliers compare baselines, monitor 
postures, and drive the industry toward a better future.

Independent Third Party Assurance Statement

Independent assurance statement 

Scope and approach 

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (‘TSMC’ or ‘the Company’) commissioned DNV Business 
Assurance  Co.  Ltd.  (“DNV”)  to  undertake  independent  assurance  of  the  2022  Sustainability  Report  (the 
“Report”) for the year ended 31 December 2022. 

We  performed  our  work  using  DNV’s  assurance  methodology  VeriSustainTM 1 ,  which  is  based  on  our 
professional experience, international assurance best practice including International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards. 

The Report also incorporated the relative sustainability reporting guidelines, such as Sustainability Accounting 
Standards  Board  (SASB)  Semiconductors  Sustainability  Accounting  Standard  and  Recommendations  of  the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 

We evaluated the performance data using the reliability principle together with TSMC data protocols for how 
the data are measured, recorded and reported. The performance data in scope was against TSMC’s significant 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues and the 2030 sustainability commitment and the topics 
set forth in the GRI standards 2021.  

We  understand  that  the  reported  financial  data  and  information  are  based  on  data  from  TSMC’s  Annual 
Report and Accounts, which are subject to a separate independent audit process.  The review of financial data 
taken from the Annual Report and Accounts is not within the scope of our work. 

•  Review of information provided to us by TSMC on its reporting and management processes relating to 

• 

• 

the Principles; 
Interview with selected Directors and senior managers responsible for management of sustainability 
issues and review of selected evidence to support issues discussed. People who worked in functions for 
financial, legal, environment (including climate change & energy, air emission, water resource, chemical 
and waste management), human resource, safety, procurement, wellness, product development, 
information security, intellectual property, trade secret and TSMC cultural and educational foundation 
were chosen to interview; 
Site visits to HQ in Taiwan, remoting meeting with other production sites to review process and systems 
for preparing site level sustainability data and implementation of sustainability strategy. Sites chosen 
were based on materiality issues; 

•  Review of supporting evidence for key claims and data in the report. Our checking processes were 
prioritised according to materiality, and we based our prioritisation on the materiality of issues at a 
consolidated corporate level; 

•  Review of the processes for gathering and consolidating the specified performance data and, for a 

sample, checking the data consolidation. Where financial data had been checked by another third party, 
and, where data of scope 1, 2 and 3 of Green House Gases Emission has been verified by DNV, we 
tested transposition from these sources to the report; Where relevant data and information has been 
generated from a certified management system note which data and management system certification 
and that this was considered;  

•  An independent assessment of TSMC’s reporting against the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 

• 

2021. 
There was a confidential issue that we cannot assess the salary data.  The verification was conducted 
based only on the Chinese version Report. 

We planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence we considered necessary to provide a basis for 
our assurance opinion. We are providing a ‘moderate / limited level’ of assurance.  

Opinion 

Responsibilities of the Directors of TSMC and of the assurance providers 

The Directors of TSMC have sole responsibility for the preparation of the Report.  In performing our 
assurance work, our responsibility is to the management of TSMC; however, our statement represents our 
independent opinion and is intended to inform all of TSMC stakeholders. DNV was not involved in the 
preparation of any statements or data included in the Report except for this Assurance Statement.  

DNV provides a range of other services to TSMC, none of which constitute a conflict of interest with this 
assurance work. 

DNV’s assurance engagements are based on the assumption that the data and information provided by the 
client to us as part of our review have been provided in good faith. DNV expressly disclaims any liability or 
co-responsibility for any decision a person or an entity may make based on this Assurance Statement. 

Basis of our opinion 

A multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists performed work at headquarters and 
site level.  We undertook the following activities:  

• 

•  Review of the current sustainability issues that could affect TSMC and are of interest to stakeholders; 
•  Review of TSMC approach to stakeholder engagement and recent outputs; 

On the basis of the work undertaken, nothing came to our attention to suggest that the Report does not 
properly describe TSMC’s adherence to the Principles.   

TSMC has developed its own data management system for capturing and reporting its ESG performances. In 
accordance with DNV VeriSustain Protocol requirements for a moderate / limited level assurance 
engagement, we conclude that no systematic errors were detected which causes us to believe that the 
specified sustainability data and information presented in the Report is not reliable. 

Observations  

Without affecting our assurance opinion, we also provide the following observations. 

The following is an excerpt from the observations and opportunities reported back to the management of 
TSMC. 
• 

Considering the completeness, balance and transparency of data disclosure, it would be advisable 
to disclose the environment information and establish targets (i.e. reducing discharge or emission) 
of domestic and overseas facilities with same scope and depth.  
To effectively achieve resource cycling goals and performance, it would be beneficial to include 
overseas facilities in this effort. Currently, only TSMC's Taiwan factory appears to be prioritizing this 
aspect.

Sustainability Context 
Sustainability Report provides an accurate and fair representation of the level of implementation of related 
ESG policies and meets the content requirements of the GRI Standards 2021. 

233

   Materiality  The materiality determination process was revalidated based on survey from key stakeholders including employees, customers, suppliers / contractors, NGOs, governments, shareholders, investors, regulatory bodies, local communities and senior management of TSMC and has not missed out any significant and known material issues about the Semiconductor Sector. A methodology has been developed to evaluate the priority of these issues and identified priority issues are fairly covered in the Report. An internal assessment process for monitoring and management on a continual basis for their long-term organisational sustainability has been established. Completeness  The Report has fairly attempted to disclose the generic disclosures and management approaches and performances of identified material topics for GRI Standards 2021. The reporting of performance and data are within the Company’s reporting boundary and reporting period except for certain material topics. A system to report the performances of material topics are being established and set the internal timelines for disclosure.  Accuracy and Reliability  The majority of data and information verified at the Corporate Office and sampling operational sites were found to be accurate and nothing came to our attention to suggest that reported data have not been properly collated from information reported at operational level, nor that the assumptions used were inappropriate. Some of the data inaccuracies identified during the verification process were found to be attributable to transcription, interpretation and aggregation errors and the errors have been communicated for correction.  Inclusivity The Company has identified the expectations of stakeholders through internal mechanisms in dialogue with different groups of stakeholders. The stakeholder concerns are well identified and documented. The significant ESG issues identified through this process are reflected in the Report. Responsiveness:  TSMC 2022 Sustainability Report meets the content requirements of the GRI Standards 2021. The report provides an accurate and fair representation of the level of implementation of related ESG policies. The Company has adequately responded to stakeholder concerns through its policies, ESG Committee, and quarterly / annual financial report, and this is reflected in the Report. Impact The Company presents the impacts related to its identified material topics by measuring and monitoring impacts through appropriate performance metrics demonstrating outcomes and outputs of its value creation processes. Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Impact.

In 2022, to manage the raw materials supply chain and identify carbon emission hotspots, a life cycle assessment of raw materials' carbon footprint was conducted.

The results indicated that chemicals, bulk gases, and silicon wafers were the main emission sources.

Thus, TSMC required relevant suppliers to stipulate rigorous short, medium, and long term energy conservation, carbon reduction, and green energy consumption targets, as well as continue to track implementation performance.

The Company also required suppliers to obtain the carbon footprint of their upstream materials and communicate their carbon reduction claims.

In 2023, TSMC will consolidate supplier carbon information related inventories as the basis for subsequent Net Zero actions.

By improving raw materials usage e ciency and decreasing the amount of raw materials required for wafer production, it is able to reduce the carbon emissions in the supply chain.

In 2022, TSMC lowered the consumption of bulk chemicals with a signi cant proportion of carbon emissions to save roughly 178,000 tons of carbon emissions at the raw materials manufacturing end via approaches such as reducing time span, extending use, replacing, and skipping stations.

Meanwhile, the Company continues to promote the Electronic grade Chemicals Recycling Program, indirectly decreasing carbon emissions and environmental impact during the upstream natural resource extraction process by using recycled chemicals in factories.

Furthermore, the Company continues to optimize procurement strategies to minimize transport carbon emissions in the supply chain.

Power to Change Society reduction targets and reduce, track, document, and disclose their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.

In 2022, TSMC continued to require and assist suppliers to improve their performance in making the supply chain greener.

The annual total energy reduction reached 190 GWh, and the accumulative total reached 530 GWh.

The annual total water reduction reached 9.37 million metric tons, and the cumulative total reached 29.08 million metric tons.

Additionally, 65% of the high energy consumption suppliers received ISO 14064 veri cation.

TSMC also required suppliers to introduce energy conservation assessments when building new factories.

The waste production per unit among major waste producing suppliers was reduced by 34%, exceeding the annual target of 32%.

Additionally, TSMC also actively promotes green innovation projects in the supply chain.

In 2022, suppliers were engaged to launch the Supplier Carbon Capture Program to help them build carbon capture equipment for recti cation columns, and reintroduce the residual gas from the recti cation process of industrial grade liquid CO2 into the process for secondary puri cation.

This is reproduced into electronic grade liquid CO2 that conforms to TSMC's quality standards.

Up until December 2022, 800 metric tons of CO2 have been captured successfully.

TSMC is dedicated to creating a green semiconductor supply chain.

Besides working with suppliers to advance the Energy Conservation Action Project for Next generation Fab Tools, suppliers with high carbon emissions were invited to join the renewable energy joint procurement project in 2022 to assist suppliers to expand the source of green power procurement and consolidate the upstream to form a low carbon supply chain.

In 2022, TSMC established a green supply chain management team to track and require suppliers to implement carbon reduction actions.

The team is also responsible for integrating TSMC's internal and external resources to help suppliers achieve their targets.

Moreover, in response to TSMC's internal application of ESG AWARD to motivate employees to constantly review carbon reduction opportunities and inspire green innovation, the Materials Management invited suppliers to submit proposals together for the rst time in 2022, such as collaborating with suppliers to recycle packaging materials or recycling and transforming calcium uoride sludge into recycled products, as well as enhancing carbon reduction awareness among TSMC personnel and the supply chain through a reward mechanism.

To alleviate the environmental problems caused by excessive packaging of raw materials, TSMC and suppliers joined forces to compile the first Supplier Material Packaging White Paper Regulations to promote reduction circulation in the three major dimensions of Health and Safety, Environmental Protection, and Packaging and Labeling Standardization to establish a Handling friendly, Environment friendly, and Automation friendly packaging culture.

More than 1,200 domestic and foreign raw materials suppliers were encouraged to improve packaging operations, striving towards the goal of optimal packaging in the supply chain.

In 2022, TSMC took the initiative to provide packaging samples for suppliers of similar materials through inventory checks, o ering improvement suggestions to elevate packaging quality.

Additionally, active promotion was conducted through the Supply Online 360 platform to encourage suppliers to implement packaging optimization from the manufacturing end to the logistics process.

Please refer to Supplier Material Packaging White Paper Regulations for further details.

TSMC aspires to be a world leading benchmark organization in environmental protection and actively integrates green management into daily operations.

The Company applies innovative technologies to climate and energy, water management, circular resources, and air pollution control, promoting a comprehensive range of sustainable actions to strengthen environmental protection and act on the rm belief in prospering with the earth's ecosystem.

Note 2: Absolute value of energy e ciency improvement targets are replaced with energy saving rate to avoid value di erences incurred by market uctuation and changes in power use.

Responding to climate change is the responsibility for sustainable business operation.

As the world's largest provider of semiconductor technologies and capacity, TSMC is committed to reaching Net Zero emissions by 2050 and has drawn Roadmap to Net Zero Emissions, targets include zero growth and gradual reduction in carbon emissions starting 2025, reducing 2030 carbon emission to 2010 levels, and reaching net zero emissions (with value chain included) by 2050.

Among these, using 100% renewable energy is one of the key strategies in realizing net zero emissions.

Other than the continuing improvements of various carbon reduction actions, TSMC is also working on expanding the use of renewable energy and establishing a diverse supply.

Since the Company included a small scale hydroelectric station as one of the sources of power supply in 2022, its yearly use of renewable energy reached 2,190 GWh, and TSMC overseas sites reached net zero emissions in Scope 1 and 2.

TSMC established carbon credits quality procurement standards for the rst time in 2022 and chose four carbon credits o set programs for carbon reduction, and referenced the UN's Convention on Biological Diversity and SDGs as guidelines to formulate its Biodiversity Statement.

O cially launched in 2023, the Statement strives to reach a balance between technology and the ecosystem to allow never ending momentum for sustainability to realize GHG reduction targets.

Global Risks Report 2023 published by the World Economic Forum (WEF) pointed out that climate related environmental issues are the most signi cant four risks of the top ten global risks over the next decade, including failure to mitigate climate change, failure of climate change adaptation, natural disasters and extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse it is clear that constantly improving climate risk response measures and enhancing corporate operational resilience are pressing important tasks.

TSMC successfully achieved uninterrupted production target in 2022 by identifying potential risks and opportunities through regular systematic risk assessment identi cation and following the Company's Climate Risk Adaptation Standards to reduce potential climate disaster.

Note: Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) is an international initiative organization that encourages companies to set an absolute GHG emission reduction target that is in line with the Paris Agreement goals with a yearly reduction of 4.2 %.

TSMC is committed to develop SBT reduction targets in 2017, and as the global demand for chips drastically increased in recent years, the CAGR of TSMC's capacity exceeds 10%.

However, as the supply from the renewable energy market in the Company's main manufacturing site was insu cient, reaching SBT requirements poses as a challenge in the short term.

Set climate change and energy management goals for 2030 in accordance with climate change performance indicators for senior executives to regularly review implementation performance.

TSMC holds the Climate Change Risk and Opportunity Workshop once every two years to identify and update climate risks and opportunities based on the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.

In 2022, the Workshop identi ed 11 transition and physical climate risks and eight opportunities.

The top three climate risks were net zero emissions, impact on company reputation, and uncertainties in the development of new energy saving carbon reduction technologies, and the top three opportunities were: develop low carbon products and services and increase energy e ciency in customer products, drive low carbon manufacturing, and boost company reputation.

Apart from continuous improvements on carbon reduction practices, TSMC also set up carbon credit procurement strategies and started implementations in 2022 to further enhance corporate climate resilience.

See TSMC TCFD Report for qualitative assessment methods and results on the nancial impacts of each risk and opportunity.

Stick to green manufacturing and green innovation.

The annual GHG inventory result is TSMC's rst step to strengthening carbon reduction by reviewing overall carbon reduction e orts and revising the emission reduction strategies on a rolling basis.

In 2022, the Company's total GHG emission was 18 million MT CO2 equivalent direct emissions from Scope 1 processes such as F GHGs and nitrous oxide processes accounted for 11% indirect GHG emissions in Scope 2 from electricity use, which was still the major emission source, accounted for 50% and indirect GHG emissions from the value chain in Scope 3 accounted for 39%, which were primarily from producing raw materials, energy related activities in the upstream, and transportation.

TSMC continues to enforce industry leading best practices for GHG reduction, including ramping up replacements and installing local scrubbers on the manufacturing end, using carbon neutral natural gases, constructing green factories with green building certi cates, implementing energy saving projects for process tools and facility equipment, and increasing the use of renewable energy.

In response to an increase in carbon cost brought about by a global trend in low carbon transition, starting from 2022, TSMC widely uses internal carbon pricing mechanism to re ect carbon cost in e cacy estimation for daily reduction measures, and include this into decision making evaluation for new fab investments.

As for emissions reduction actions in Scope 3, TSMC continues to focus on increasing material use e ciency and implement electronic grade chemical reuse.

Total emission on low carbon transition and their own carbon hot spots, and helps them develop strategy and target on carbon reduction.

TSMC also shares with suppliers its Best Known Method to support them to implement green actions together.

TSMC is committed to reducing carbon footprints in raw material manufacturing and transportation to product manufacturing, testing, and assembling phases.

In 2022, the Company obtained ISO 14067 third party certi cation, and conduct Product Carbon Footprint Assessment every three years.

Other than actively reducing greenhouse gas emissions in manufacturing processes and improving resource e ciency, the Company also o ers guidance for suppliers to join its consistent endeavors in realizing environmental sustainability.

In addition, although the life cycle of TSMC's product carbon footprint covers from raw material excavation to shipment, through providing highly energy e cient process technology, TSMC supported clients in increasing the life span and function innovation of terminal smart devices applied in various elds, including developing smart home, smart city, smart health care, smart industry.

This further helps save energy for the world, as every kWh of power used in production can help save four kWh of power for other industries worldwide and households.

Increasing the use of renewable energy is critical to achieving the Company's goal of Net Zero Emissions by 2050.

In 2022, with support from the board and management team, TSMC introduced renewable energy from small hydroelectric stations, continued to increase power supply from onshore wind farms, increased renewable energy usage by 47% to 970 GWh, and maintained 100% use of renewable energy in global o ces.

TSMC also signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) for 1.3 GW of renewable energy with the option to increase around 3,900 GWh of green energy each year.

By the end of 2022, the Company has signed on 2.9 GW of renewable energy through PPAs, which can reduce around 4.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions each year.

In addition, TSMC has been purchasing renewable energy, Renewable Energy Certi cates (RECs), and carbon credits in countries with comprehensive regulations and ample supply to o set 100% of carbon emissions from power used in overseas locations, including the United States, Canada, Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. 2022 marks the fth consecutive year that TSMC has achieved zero carbon emissions from power consumption in overseas subsidiaries.

Promote diversi cation of renewable energy sources.

In addition to purchasing renewable energy, TSMC has also installed solar panels in TSMC facilities to produce carbon free renewable energy for its own fabs.

In 2022, TSMC had an installed capacity of 5,340 kWp in solar panels, which provided 4.56 GWh in electricity and reduced carbon emissions by 2,322 metric tons.

In 2023, an additional 900 kW of solar panel capacity will be installed, which can generate up to 4.6 GWh of electricity.

While strengthening its own climate resilience, the Company is also expanding the scope of e orts toward sustainability and common good through TSMC Charity Foundation's Public Welfare Green Energy Project to install photovoltaic (PV) systems and give back all earnings from power rebates to organizations serving disadvantaged communities.

As of 2022, the Company has provided an installed capacity of 464 kWp across seven locations and generated 574,000 kWh in electricity.

In 2022, it also gave back NT 2.75 million from rebates generated by the project.

Semiconductor technologies are evolving rapidly and increasing energy consumption.

In 2022, TSMC consumed a total of 22,400 GWh in energy with purchased electricity accounting for around 94%, natural gases for 5.8%, and diesel for 0.2%.

TSMC is dedicated to optimizing energy use e ciency.

The Energy Saving and Carbon Reduction Committee has de ned ve major energy conservation teams for di erent process technologies to explore opportunities to save energy and maximize energy conservation in tools.

In 2022, TSMC was able to conserve 700 GWh in electricity and successfully increase process energy e ciency for 5nm volume production to 60% in the third year, exceeding the annual target.

In 2022, the ve major energy conservation teams continued to innovate various energy conservation programs, including the Hot Water Recycling System, Intelligent Compressed Dry Air (CDA) Flow Control System, and Optimized AI powered Water Chiller System.

In addition, TSMC is deploying a variety of green action plans to improve energy and resource e ciency.

To strengthen energy conservation and carbon emissions, TSMC founded the Engineering Center for Green Manufacturing in 2022 to comprehensively assess, plan, and manage net zero emission strategies, energy conservation in modules and tools, energy conservation in facility equipment, and low carbon technology R D. Additionally, TSMC integrated energy saving measures across facilities for horizontal roll out, which will become standard designs for new facilities.

Taiwan facilities in energy conservation to generate more green bene ts.

In 2022, TSMC implemented 684 energy conservation measures across eight categories, achieving a 13% energy saving rate and conserving 700 GWh in electricity.

Energy conserved in 2022 is the equivalent of reducing 360,000 metric tons in carbon emissions and saving NT 1.75 billion in energy costs.

The reduced carbon emissions also decreased the potential social cost of carbon by NT 530 million.

As of 2022, the Energy Conservation Action Project for Next generation Fab Tools launched in 2018 has validated and applied 195 energy conservation programs to hundreds types of advanced process tools and conserved 500 GWh in energy through cross fab roll out of energy conservation measures.

TSMC cares about environmental sustainability and actively works to strike a balance between technology and ecology.

To ensure sustainable ecosystems and maintain biodiversity, TSMC regularly assesses changes in ecosystems surrounding TSMC fabs, cultivates indigenous species, created re y habitats within TSMC locations, and launched the TSMC Plant a Tree Program to facilitate stable population growth and reproduction for species.

In addition to implementing eco friendly practices, TSMC is also an avid supporter of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and SDGs.

Biodiversity Statement in 2022, which will be formally declared in 2023.

TSMC's Biodiversity Statement will commit to working with stakeholders to protect and deepen the integrity of biodiversity and working with supply chain partners to raise awareness and comply with related regulations within business locations, ful lling its mission of strengthening environmental protection.

In 2022 Q4, TSMC conducted a Dependencies Impacts on Nature and Biodiversity Assessment for deeper insights into interactions between operations and local environments, analyzing three areas location of facilities, emission of pollutants, and dependency on ecosystem services.

For location of facilities, TSMC overlapped the Company's locations in Taiwan with the Forestry's Bureau National Ecological Network GIS database and included resources consumed and emissions discharged throughout operations as assessment factors to identify mitigation and restoration.

Plant a total of 122,000 trees with TSMC Plant a Tree Program since the start of the program around fabs and enforce environmental education.

In addition, TSMC is working with stakeholders such as the Forestry Bureau, county and city governments, research and education institutes, and conservation groups to promote conservation programs based on conservation corridor assessment results and deepen the diverse values of biodiversity.

For pollutant emissions, TSMC used qualitative analysis of Life Cycle Impact and identi ed GHG emissions as the main cause of impact on biodiversity, followed by water consumption.

TSMC is driving low carbon manufacturing and enforcing GHG reduction standard practices to e ectively reduce GHG emissions per unit of production.

The Company also complies with AWS Standards to enforce sustainable water management at all TSMC fabs and improves surrounding ecosystems and soil and water conservation to foster biodiversity.

For dependency on ecosystem services, which was explored for the rst time in 2022, TSMC established a dedicated internal unit and invited outside experts to join in meetings and discussions and also compiled a survey on supplier enforcement.

Results showed that TSMC and its supply chain are more dependent on three types of ecosystem services water provision, climate regulation, and ood prevention.

TSMC will continue to strengthen the climate resilience, promote green and low carbon supply chains, and strengthen management in compliance with the Climate Risk Adaptation Standards to reduce dependency on ecosystem services and mitigate impact on operations from loss of ecosystem services.

TSMC is committed to driving green manufacturing and actively implements energy e ciency innovations.

The Company continues to optimize the energy saving model of water chiller systems through machine learning methods and successfully develops three functions including Single Chiller Compressor Abnormal Energy Consumption Detection, Multi chiller Compressor Operating Load Precision Forecast, and Water Chiller System Pressure Control Optimization to strengthen operational reliability.

TSMC introduced the three functions to Fab 15A in 2022, saving 2 GWh of electricity and reducing 1,000 metric tons of carbon emissions.

In 2023, all TSMC 12 inch wafer fabs in Taiwan will begin to adopt the three functions, which are also listed as standard designs for new plants.

Those initiatives are expected to save 100 GWh of electricity per year and reduce carbon emissions by 50,000 metric tons, bringing TSMC closer to its 2050 sustainability goal of Net Zero Emissions.

TSMC has successfully applied EUV technologies for 3nm volume production, but energy consumption rises with the growing number of EUV tools.

To ensure developments in process technologies do not compromise environmental sustainability, the Company continues to optimize EUV tool parameters and reduce energy consumption per unit of wafer production through big data analysis.

Additionally, TSMC engages suppliers for research to dive deep and uncover opportunities to conserve more energy.

Research has shown that EUV light is transmitted with the help of unique re ective mirrors, which, after bouncing o several mirrors, result in severe energy attenuation.

The multilayer mirror's atness and smoothness determines EUV light re ectivity, so, to increase energy e ciency, TSMC has engaged suppliers to netune mirror fabrication processes and optical structures to optimize atness and smoothness and e ectively improve re ectivity.

EUV light is produced from laser pulses ring 50,000 times per second at a drop of tin.

Vaporized tin often deposits on mirrors to cause fog, which impacts productivity.

The Company then needs to inject hydrogen and tin to produce tin hydride before pulling the multilayer mirror out of the chamber.

After repeated testing with suppliers, TSMC was able to pinpoint the optimal parameters for the number of pumps required for tin vapor removal, e ectively reducing energy consumed by tin vapor pumps.

In 2022, TSMC was able to successfully reduce energy consumption per wafer from EUV tools by 22%, the equivalent of 60 GWh.

TSMC is committed to creating an environmentally and socially responsible business model.

To ful ll the Company's commitment of Net Zero Emissions by 2050, the Corporate Environment Safety Health Division, Finance, Accounting, Legal, Information Technology and Materials Management, and Supply Chain Management Units formed the Carbon Credit Task Force and formulated the Carbon Credits Quality Standards for Voluntary Emissions Reductions in compliance with international guidelines and industry practices to serve as purchasing guidelines.

TSMC assessed carbon credit veri cation standards, year issued, additionality, permanence, and risk management.

Additionally, the Company prioritizes programs that comply with UN SDGs such as Climate, Community Biodiversity (CCB) and the criteria that the source of carbon credits should align with emissions for rigorous quality assurance to extend the scope of TSMC's sustainability impact.

Four Nature based Carbon Credit Programs energy and exhaust gas reduction facilities to maximize emissions reduction.

The remaining carbon emissions are o set, in principle, with carbon credits.

In 2022, TSMC selected four carbon credit programs located in the U.S. and China that comply with the Company's Carbon Credits Quality Standards for Voluntary Emissions Reductions.

The programs are mainly nature based carbon credits from projects that establish natural forests and improve forest management.

Two of the natural forest establishment programs create jobs for local residents and foster skillsets in maintaining the forest 50% of the jobs created are o ered to women to facilitate gender equality.

The remaining two programs improve forest management to uphold local biodiversity and help local conservation groups and indigenous communities preserve traditional cultures and outdoor education through earnings from carbon credits.

Through carbon credit trading, TSMC has been able to not only o set carbon emissions but also ful ll several SDGs to create diverse sustainability bene ts.

Water pollution composite indicator reduction rate of 60% Note 3.

Note 1: In 2022, TSMC newly built Fab 18 Phases 6, 7 8.

Excluding the new facilities, the unit water consumption was 15.6% in 2022.

In the future, facilities below a certain economic scale will be excluded from the calculation of unit water consumption (1) The source of reclaimed water include municipal drainage and industrial discharge (2) Replacement rate of reclaimed water consumption volume of reclaimed water (consumption volume of reclaimed water tap water).

Figures from TSMC fabs in Taiwan In 2022, TSMC was able to reduce the water pollution composite indicator by 54.3%, exceeding the 2022 target of 45% and long term 2030 goal of 50%.

As such, the 2030 goal was changed from 50% to over 60%.

In 2022, Taiwan experienced zero typhoons while weather fronts carrying moisture failed to cover reservoirs in Taiwan, resulting in little rainfall in Southern Taiwan.

Based on the drought monitoring signals issued by the Water Resources Agency, TSMC adopted response measures in compliance with the TSMC Internal Control Procedures for Low Water Supply Crisis Management to take stock of areas where more water could be conserved and to strengthen the water use e ciency of recycling systems.

In 2022, the Company conserved 3.35 million m3 of water and recycled a cumulative total of 215 million m3 of water throughout the year.

While working to increase water reclamation e ciency, TSMC also cares about getting the most use out of every drop of water.

As such, TSMC is actively developing water reclamation technologies.

On September 19, 2022, the TSMC Tainan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant Taiwan's rst privately operated water reclamation plant became operational and started recycling industrial wastewater produced in the Southern Taiwan Science Park into reclaimed water for advanced semiconductor processes, a rst for the global semiconductor industry.

TSMC also continues to work with the government and is planning to complete the Tainan Anping Reclaimed Water Plant in 2023, which is estimated to reclaim 35,000 m3 of water per day for TSMC facilities in the Southern Taiwan Science Park (STSP).

TSMC's goal is to increase the supply of reclaimed water to gradually reduce city water consumption each year.

The Company is also exploring the concept of being water positive in the hope of restoring water resources in the future and upholding sustainable water practices.

Every year, TSMC evaluates the water risk levels of all TSMC facilities using the Water Risk Atlas from the World Resources Institute (WRI).

Results from 2022 were identical to those of 2021: WaferTech was rated as low risk TSMC facilities in Taiwan and VisEra were rated as medium to low risk and TSMC (China) and TSMC (Nanjing) were rated as high and medium to high risk, respectively, due to regional water quality di erences.

In 2022, TSMC added Fab 18B into the water risk evaluation.

While building Fab 18B, TSMC preemptively elevated foundations, installed oodgates, and applied existing recycling systems and wastewater treatment measures to the facility.

By the time Fab 18B became operational, it already possessed outstanding ood protection and process water recycling rate, which enabled it to maximize water resources and mitigate environmental impact.

In 2022, Fab 12A, Fab 12B, and Fab 5 at Hsinchu Science Park and Advanced Backend Fab 3 at Lungtan Science Park obtained Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Platinum certi cation.

All advanced TSMC fabs in Taiwan's three science parks have obtained AWS Platinum certi cation (the highest level available) for three consecutive years, a rst for the global semiconductor industry.

Sustainable water stewardship at TSMC complies with AWS standards.

In 2022, the Company introduced water reclaimed from industrial wastewater to facilities at the STSP for the rst time.

The reclaimed water was gradually supplied to Fab 6, Fab 14, and Fab 18 to reduce city water consumption and achieve the preliminary target toward sustainable water balance.

TSMC's e orts toward good water quality include a new tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) treatment system in Fab 3 to e ectively reduce e uent concentration by 90% 70% copper concentration reduction from e uents discharged by Advanced Backend Fab 3 to improve local creek water quality.

After improving the cooling equipment of the reaction tank and reducing the batch reaction time, in June 2022, the hyfro uoric (HF) acid waste regeneration system in Fab 15B achieved zero treatment outsourcing of the HF acid waste liquid.

The hydro uoric acid waste regeneration system processed a cumulative total of 4,193 metric tons of HF acid waste and produced 1,025 metric tons of cryolite in 2022.

In addition, ecological restoration and soil and water conservation in areas surrounding TSMC facilities are AWS implementation priorities.

TSMC compiled the TSMC Fire y Habitat Management Process to bring back re ies and launched a orestation initiatives.

In 2022, over 1,900 adult re ies appeared across TSMC's three major factories.

The Company also planted 108,000 trees and 320,000 shrubs, expanding a orested areas to 10.1 hectares to create a healthier water environment.

TSMC has created an internal Water Map platform to e ectively manage and gain insights into water used in TSMC facilities.

The Company also continues to track reservoir water levels and install in house water quality and water level monitoring points to monitor water usage, recycled water, wastewater, and domestic water consumption in processes according to the water balance chart.

This forms the basis for integrating water consumption and recycle and reuse mechanisms to calculate recycling discharge rates and allocate water to units that use water.

In 2022, TSMC continued to implement four major water saving measures: reducing facility system water consumption, increasing the wastewater recycling of facilities, improving the water production rate of the system, and decreasing water discharge loss from the system.

The Company conserved 3.35 million m3 of water and yielded a wafer unit water consumption of 137.3 liter per 12 inch equivalent wafer mask layer, a 2.6% reduction from the 140.9 liter per 12 inch equivalent wafer mask layer in 2010, the base year.

Nevertheless, TSMC failed to reach the 2022 target because new facilities built in 2022 were still in risk production stages.

Though the new facilities have not yet reached economic scale, there was still a xed amount of water consumption, which led to a lower water saving rate.

Wastewater discharge was 93.0 liter per 12 inch equivalent wafer mask layer, an 18% increase from last year.

The increase was also caused by the water consumption for risk production in new facilities.

Before the new facilities reach economic scale in production, TSMC will continue to optimize operating parameters for water recycling systems, increase water use e ciency, and reduce wastewater discharge.

TSMC is committed to reducing product water footprint in various stages, including raw material manufacturing and transportation, product manufacturing, testing, and packaging, etc.

The water footprint of products is assessed every three years.

In 2022, the Company obtained third party ISO 14046 certi cation.

In terms of water quality indicators, TSMC and raw material suppliers account for 47% and 53%, respectively.

Water pollutants are mainly suspended solids, metals, and chemical oxygen demand (COD).

In addition to actively reducing water consumption from production processes and discharge of water pollutants, TSMC also helps suppliers to set water conservation targets with the Sustainability Management Self Assessment Questionnaire.

All suppliers are required to adhere to the TSMC Supplier Code of Conduct to manage water use and discharge, while identifying opportunities for water saving and implementing measures.

For more details, please refer to Sustainable Supply Chain in this report.

The year 2022 marked the start of water reclamation at TSMC.

To get the most out of every drop of water, TSMC is actively conserving water from production processes while also developing water reclamation technologies.

To ensure water quality complies with advanced process speci cations and their demands for cleanliness, TSMC works with the government, industry, and academia to develop low energy consumption biological treatment, low energy consumption sludge treatment, high e ciency urea removal process, and other innovative technologies.

The Company also establishes multi layered, real time, and automatic monitoring systems to ensure the quality of reclaimed water supplies.

In September 2022, the TSMC Tainan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant entered into operation as a center for processing, monitoring, and supplying TSMC facilities in the STSP.

As of December 2022, the Reclaimed Water Plant has supplied 380,000 m3 of water reclaimed from industrial wastewater.

To develop diverse water resources, the Water Reclamation Plant in Anping, Tainan, will be completed and enter into operation in 2023.

In 2026, the water supply capacity of the Tainan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant will reach up to 36,000 m3 per day, reducing city water consumption and contributing positively to the surrounding environment.

TSMC is also designing innovative systems to reclaim concentrated wastewater and make waste sludge reusable through waste heat, thereby reducing the discharge of high concentration wastewater.

In 2022, TSMC completed the TSMC Tainan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant and also launched the Hsinchu Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant project to expand the use of reclaimed water.

The Hsinchu Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant is expected to supply 10,000 m3 of water per day in 2025.

With the Hsinchu Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant and reclaimed water provided by the city government, new fabs in the Hsinchu Science Park will use 100% reclaimed water, strengthening TSMC's operational resiliency and ful lling the commitment to achieve sustainable water cycle management.

TSMC continues to advance the performance of water pollution control and treatment processes.

As advanced processes have evolved and increased the use of organic chemicals, TSMC has introduced a membrane bioreactor system to strengthen water pollutant removal.

In 2022, average COD and TMAH concentration levels were reduced to 151.5 ppm and 3.75 ppm, respectively.

Fab 15B introduced rotating packed bed technology in 2022 to further reduce COD levels.

Lab test results showed that 70% of COD levels in water can be reduced.

Note: Figures from TSMC fabs in Taiwan out this technology in 2023.

Due to the increased use of cobalt sulfate, cobalt sulfate treatment systems have also been expanded, which have helped to achieve a 54.3% water pollution composite indicator reduction rate, far exceeding the 2022 target of 45% and 2030 goal of 50%.

As such, the reduction rate goal for 2030 has been raised to over 60% to achieve environmental sustainability.

To classify and treat wastewater, TSMC has developed 38 separation systems based on the composition and concentration of wastewater for treatment, recycling, and reuse.

In the third quarter of 2022, Fab 15B successfully eliminated HF acid waste outsourcing by optimizing the hydro uoric acid waste regeneration system, further perfecting the renewable technologies of local circular economy industries.

TSMC also performed sludge tests, a byproduct of the chemical mechanical polishing process, at the Zero Waste Manufacturing Center, turning sludge into aluminum silicon oxide through dehydration, grinding, and surface modi cation.

The aluminum silicon oxide can then be used as plastic llers for factory use.

As semiconductor technologies continue to evolve, the consumption of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI) increases to treat pollutants in wastewater.

To practice green manufacturing, reduce environmental impacts, and improve the water quality of e uents, TSMC launched the NaOCI reduction project in 2022.

Between pH 5.5 and 6.5, NaOCl turns into hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a strong oxidizing agent approximately 80 times stronger than NaOCl.

TSMC capitalized on HOCI's strong oxidizing properties by adding recycled sulfuric acid to NaOCl with deionized water (DI water).

After optimizing the mixing ratio, it became possible to convert NaOCl to HOCl stably, reducing NaOCI consumption without compromising disinfection and ammonia nitrogen removal.

In 2022, the HOCI conversion system was introduced to Fab 15B for pilot run.

It is estimated that annual NaOCI consumption and carbon emissions can be reduced by 80 metric tons and 10 metric tons, respectively.

The Company will continue to roll out the system in other facilities as it is friendlier for the environment and can increase the reuse value of waste liquids, promoting environmental sustainability through green innovation.

Note 2: Derived from the general waste (incineration) coe cient (0.737 kg of CO2e kg).

Note 3: TSMC requires waste treatment vendors to at least acquire ISO 14001 or ISO 45001 certi cations as the basis for standardized management.

Waste treatment vendors include waste treatment and recycling vendors.

TSMC is a committed advocate of the circular economy and upholds the management principles of minimizing waste, maximizing resource recycling, and optimizing vendor management in its e orts to develop a comprehensive waste management system.

As the Company continues to develop advanced processes, more raw materials are consumed and more waste is produced.

As such, TSMC strives to achieve resource sustainability through three major strategies: source reduction, circular economy, and audit and guidance.

In 2022, the Company's waste recycling rate reached 96%, and the land ll rate was less than 1% for 13 consecutive years.

TSMC is also working with vendors to deploy renewable technologies that can successfully produce green energy from organic sludge and reuse activated carbon waste in house to create a circular system.

Raw materials for other industries like optoelectronic semiconductor, chemical industries, etc.

Note 2: Outsourced recycling total solid waste in Taiwan facilities are 114,492 metric tons year, and subsidiaries are 6,195 metric tons year.

TSMC is actively practicing green manufacturing and implementing source reduction strategies to minimize waste.

The interdepartmental Waste Management Task Force utilizes the Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) management cycle to set waste reduction goals and improvement plans at the beginning of each year.

The Task Force also leverages the Unit Waste Production Management System to directly manage and control waste production and reduction.

Waste management units convene monthly to track the progress and outcomes of waste reduction measures.

In 2022, TSMC was able to reduce waste by over 20,000 metric tons through 129 projects that reduced chemical use time and quantity, adopted new chemicals, and extended use cycles.

Wafer cleaning processes and their cleanliness levels are important factors impacting yield.

The higher yield demands of advanced processes have increased the use of sulfuric acids (cleaning solvent).

Process, equipment, and facility organizations worked together to improve post wet etching cleaning steps by increasing acid valve speeds for sulfuric peroxide mixture (SPM) cleaning processes by 54%.

In 2022, sulfuric acid waste produced from cleaning each 12 wafer was successfully reduced by 20% without compromising quality.

In 2023, this process will be deployed to all facilities, which is expected to help reduce sulfuric acid waste liquid by 30,000 metric tons in 2024.

Manufacturing Equipment Waste Reduction 20,000 metric tons.

TSMC is committed to carrying out source reduction strategies.

By developing a closed loop cycle to recycle waste for in house use, the Company has been able to reduce resource consumption and minimize environmental impacts.

Activated carbon is used to recycle wastewater at TSMC.

The resulting waste was previously outsourced to waste treatment vendors for treatment.

To ensure the quality of recycled carbon complies with TSMC standards, several parameters were repeatedly tested and veri ed: hardness (loss from abrasions), iodine value (adsorption capabilities), and apparent density (activation levels).

In 2022, TSMC was able to produce recycled activated carbon with adsorption capabilities and use cycles consistent with new activated carbon.

The recycling process will be deployed to all Taiwan fabs in 2023, which will allow the reuse of activated carbon to reduce outsourcing by 6,000 metric tons and generate NT 30 million in green bene ts each year, e ectively growing the Company's circular economy and supporting environmental sustainability.

In addition to source reduction, TSMC is also carrying out circular economy practices to ful ll long term goals for 2030 of outsourcing less than 0.5kg of waste per wafer unit.

Through the Action Plan to Turn Waste into High Value Products, resource recycling equipment were deployed in the Taiwan fabs that were able to increase the recycling of six types of waste liquids into high value products for internal use or sale.

Over 260,000 metric tons of resources were recycled with an in house resource recycling rate of 28%, which was 6% higher than in 2021 and generated NT 1 billion in bene ts.

The central utility plant structure of the Zero Waste Manufacturing Center was completed, which is slated to enter into operation in 2023.

As for the Electronics grade Chemicals Recycling Program, TSMC continues to conduct evaluations and expects to purify waste into electronic grade chemicals for internal use.

The closed loop cycle can reduce operating risks and maximize the value of recycled products.

The Industry Cooperation to Co create Resources Project involves working with vendors from other industries to reduce incineration and land ll rates.

In 2022, TSMC increased recycling rates from 95% to 96% and reduced land ll rates from 0.2% to 0.1%.

To achieve the 2050 goal of net zero emissions and zero waste, TSMC worked with vendors and introduced anaerobic digestion to treat organic sludge, which can then be used to generate green energy.

Power to Change Society able to reuse instead of incinerating plastic waste through four principles: source management, internal and external sorting, innovative technologies, and high value products.

In 2022, TSMC successfully developed garbage bags from 100% recycled materials for internal use.

Other plastic waste was converted into solid fuel and supplied to combined heat and power (CHP) cogeneration plants to reduce coal consumption.

The technology will go live in the fourth quarter of 2022 and be deployed to all facilities in 2023.

Phase 1 and 2 of Fab 12 previously obtained the highest platinum rating for zero waste to land lls (UL 2799), and all Taiwan facilities and subsidiaries will seek to obtain UL 2799 certi cation in 2023 and 2025, respectively, as well.

In addition, as most of TSMC's waste treatment vendors use diesel trucks, TSMC launched the Electric Waste Removal Truck Program in 2022 and started conducting assessments.

It was discovered that electric trucks produce 45% fewer carbon emissions per kilometer than diesel trucks.

The Program is part of the Company's e orts to uphold the TSMC Environmental Policy.

To promote green innovation, TSMC worked with vendors to launch the Anaerobic Digestion of Organic Sludge R D Project, using anaerobic digestion (AD) to treat organic sludge and produce marsh gas, a form of bio energy, for the rst time.

In 2022, the Company led an application to the Hsinchu Science Park Administration and received approval in September to test out AD for organic sludge treatment at Fab 12 Phases 6 and 7.

As of the end of December, the incineration of organic sludge was successfully reduced by 125 metric tons.

Using anaerobic bacteria, it is possible to break down organic sludge through four stages methanogenesis of methane, for power generation.

Each metric ton of organic sludge can generate approximately 2.2 kWh of energy through AD.

The goal is to recycle instead of incinerate 100% of organic sludge in 2024, which reduces outsourced incineration by 6,500 metric tons, increases recycling rates at Taiwan facilities by 1%, and creates a circular system that can help usher in the future of green energy.

To ensure a safe waste clean up system, TSMC established the Supplier Transportation Management White Paper, requiring waste clean up vendors to strengthen systems for waste removal trucks, drivers, processes before during after clean up, and education and training and obtain ISO 45001 certi cation before 2023.

Waste clean up vendors are asked to protect employee health and reduce environmental risks by creating safe workplaces.

As of the end of 2022, 80% of waste clean up vendors have obtained ISO 45001 certi cation.

In the same year, TSMC conducted on site audits of 41 waste clean up vendors, inspected 100% of tank trucks and sludge clean up trucks, and mitigated ten de ciencies.

TSMC believes that corporate growth and environmental protection go hand in hand.

In the rst stage, new vendor selection, an interdisciplinary team of experts conducts document reviews and on site inspections across six dimensions to ensure compliance in waste treatment, facilities, and on site operations.

Approved vendors then enter the second stage, which includes quarterly on site audits to con rm the ow of waste.

In 2022, new assessment items were added on environmental sustainability to two of the eight dimensions evaluated during annual audits, operations management and waste management.

The items added drive vendors to work with TSMC toward a sustainable environment by obtaining ISO certi cations, reducing and taking stock of GHG emissions, committing to carbon neutrality, recycling resources, and implementing smart management.

Lastly, vendors that perform poorly in three dimensions assessed during annual audits are replaced to enforce green practices throughout the supply chain.

In 2022, TSMC conducted on site audits of 58 waste treatment vendors, reaching an audit ratio of 100% and mitigating 106 de ciencies.

The number of de ciencies was reduced by 17% from 2021, and the percentage of Excellent and Good vendors has increased from 36% in 2015 to 80%.

In 2022, another long term KPI was added under the Circular Resource section  increase the percentage of Excellent Good waste treatment vendors to 90% by 2030 to enhance vendor quality and generate greater impacts on sustainability from the supply chain.

Additionally, 84% of waste treatment vendors have obtained ISO 14001 certi cation.

All waste treatment vendors are expected to obtain the certi cation by the end of 2030.

TSMC continues to leverage digital tools to improve the Intelligent Waste Management Procedure with Full Traceability.

In 2022, the EPA invited the Company to the Environmental Regulation Enforcement Corporate Integrity Forum and National Environmental Regulation Enforcement Conference to share how it was able to strengthen management, recycle resources, and reduce risks of illegal disposal by vendors.

By sharing its experiences, TSMC hopes to lead the industry into a sustainable future through digital transformation.

Note: TSMC actively invests resources to lower environmental impacts.

TSMC is committed to air pollution control and has adopted the Emission Source Classi cation method and multi phase Best Available Technology (BAT) to enhance the performance of pollution control.

In 2022, Wet Electrostatic Precipitator Scrubber was applied in TSMC process for the rst time, which used high temperature sulfuric acid for cleaning, reducing alkaline gases and particulate matter (PM2.5) by 90% and 91%, respectively.

Air Pollution Control Procedures areas: air pollution monitoring, water quality analysis, and environmental protection in surrounding areas.

In addition, TSMC is conducting veri cations to help facilities quickly identify target pollutants, apply BAT, and introducing E uents and Water Quality Management for Scrubbers to regularly inspect water quality to ensure air pollution control equipment is operating at optimum levels.

In 2022, TSMC was able to meet the annual target for air pollutant emissions per unit of production as well as the annual target for volatile organic gases reduction, continuing to move toward sustainability goals.

Acid, alkaline, and volatile organic gases comprise the majority of air pollutants produced by the semiconductor industry.

TSMC employs two approaches Classi cation and Reduction of Emission from Sources and Strengthened Management of Terminal Prevention Facilities to achieve BAT with this multi phase system and e ectively control air pollutant emissions.

Exhaust gases are separated in the rst stage based on their properties toxic, corrosive, ammable, per uorocarbon greenhouse gases, and acidic alkaline.

The gases are rst introduced to high e ciency local scrubbers that will process highly concentrated pollutants.

The gases with low concentrations will then be sent to central scrubbers, which are terminal prevention facilities, for the second stage of rinsing and neutralization.

Depending on their boiling points, volatile organic gases may be sent to condensation type scrubbers rst and then to zeolite rotor concentrators for adsorption, reducing emissions and improving decontamination results.

As TSMC accelerates the development of advanced process technologies, the New Tool New Chemical Review Committee evaluates the hazard of new processes and chemicals on ESH to prevent added risks of air pollution.

In 2022, the Committee conducted 430 reviews for 198 new tools and 232 new chemicals.

The two stage review enables the Committee to carefully identify optimal separation methods and local scrubbers for new tools and chemicals.

Depending on exhaust gas properties, they are sent to di erent types of local scrubbers thermal, burn, plasma, wet with chemical dosage, adsorption, condensation, and wet for pre treatment.

As TSMC continues to bring in new types of high e ciency local scrubbers, the Company is also working with suppliers to optimize the performances of existing local scrubbers.

In 2022, TSMC applied the wet electrostatic precipitator scrubber in the process which used high temperature sulfuric acid for cleaning in Fab 12B, using corona technologies and wet scrubber method to remove pollutants alkaline gases and PM2.5 at the same time.

Launched in 2021, the three year High e ciency Spray Equipment Upgrade Program to upgrade existing thermal wet scrubber has upgraded 508 scrubbers, with a nish rate of 68% by the end of 2022.

Power to Change Society gases are channeled to central treatment facilities for scrubbing and acid alkali neutralization to remove pollutants.

Exhaust gases from certain wet processes that emit large amounts of acid alkaline gases are sent to a two step scrubbing central scrubber connecting washing tower to increase pollutant adsorption.

To enhance the e ectiveness of central scrubbers, existing facilities installed hydro membranes, changed lters, and added Raschig rings to optimize tower structures and decontamination.

High e ciency Central Scrubbers in new facilities to enhance the overall performance of terminal prevention facilities.

As for volatile organic gas treatment, TSMC continues to carry out the Low e ciency Single Zeolite Rotor Concentrators renew Initiative in existing facilities and install Dual Zeolite Rotor Concentrators in new facilities.

In 2022, all facilities reduced volatile organic gases by 98.9%.

Due to enhanced prevention and control measures, total air pollutant emissions have not increased with the addition of new facilities.

When concentrated gases adsorbed by zeolite rotors enter thermal oxidizers, pyrolysis can remove volatile organic gas pollutants but may also produce the byproduct of nitrous oxide (NOx) pollutants.

In 2022, Fab 18 Phase 7 applied low nitrous oxide burner (low NOx burner) in the volatile organic gas treatment facilities, using Moderate or Intense Low Oxygen Dilution (MILD) thermal oxidizers and combustion ow eld control technologies to reduce NOx emissions by 65% each year.

Note: Figures from TSMC fabs in Taiwan, TSMC (China), TSMC (Nanjing), and VisEra.

In compliance with TSMC Environmental Policy, the Company is dedicated to reducing air pollution emissions.

The Environmental Lab has strengthened pollutant monitoring and management for stacks, using baseline management to control the concentration of air pollutants, achieve source reduction and enhance the performance of prevention facilities.

In 2022, 104 stacks exceeding baseline concentration standards have been mitigated by the decontamination method, including replacing terminal prevention facilities that have reached the end of their life cycles, upgrading existing facilities, or introducing new high e ciency facilities.

For air pollution sampling, the Environmental Lab introduced various sampling and analysis technologies according to the demands and regulatory requirements.

In 2022, the Lab developed ways to analyze inorganic acids, ammonia, heavy metals, NMHCs, etc., to increase the facilities' abilities for di erent pollutants identi cation, provide sampling data more rapidly, and shorten mitigation period.

The Lab further traced air pollution sources by sampling central scrubber exhaust ducts to con rm the source of abnormal exhaust gas emissions.

Then, TSMC can investigate upstream process tools to clarify special gases and emission properties for ensuring the coverage rate of local scrubber installation is su cient.

The Lab also veri es the performance of upgraded local scrubber, ller variance, and optimal parameters.

This allows facilities to rapidly develop optimal treatment for target pollutants.

In 2022, 2,282 exhaust ducts, sub ducts, and equipment units were sampled and tested 16 cases of mixed acid and alkaline gas emissions were found and resolved, and improved performances in 15 treatment facilities were veri ed.

For water quality testing, the Environmental Lab provided the analyzation for 29 items of pollutants in scrubber water.

The result showed that water containing acid base ions could be turned into gaseous pollutants at certain pH levels.

In 2022, the Environmental Lab established E uents and Water Quality Management for Scrubbers to regularly inspect water status to ensure air pollution control equipment operates at the optimal levels.

TSMC is strengthening the reliability of air pollution control equipment operating systems and air pollution monitoring to ensure compliance with Taiwan and overseas regulations.

The Company also deployed automatic monitoring systems total hydrocarbon monitors, online IPA monitors, and online uorine gas monitors to rigorously control monitoring data and actual emission levels.

In addition, the Facility Division, Industrial Safety and Environmental Protection Division, and Instrument Control System Division used Automatic System for Legal Air Pollutant Coe cient Upgrades and Inspection, Facility Parameter Change Management System, and Facility Monitoring and Data Collection System to monitor facility parameters.

The systems automatically compare and inspect data to prevent aws or losses from human error.

This e ectively increases the accuracy and reliability of TSMC reports to government agencies.

In addition, to ensure air pollution treatment facilities remain at optimal e ciency for operations all year round, all control equipment is equipped with a Dual track Independent Monitoring System that allows the Facility Division and Industrial Safety and Environmental Protection Division to perform emergency repairs or initiate backup systems to minimize damages and losses.

TSMC also adopts the N 1 rule where all equipment must have at least one backup system and uses Uninterrupted Power Supply Systems to help ful ll the management target of zero failure in control equipment.

With dedicated e orts from various divisions, TSMC is proud to report zero abnormal occurrences in air pollution control equipment in 2022.

With the evolution of advanced processes, TSMC continues to work with suppliers to optimize the performance of air pollution prevention equipment and has applied Wet Electrostatic Precipitator (wet EP) Scrubbers in the process which used high temperature sulfuric acid for cleaning.

As this process simultaneously uses acids, alkaline, and organic chemicals, it produces large amounts of acid alkaline gases and high concentration PM2.5.

TSMC improved on wet EP corona technologies to ensure safety and enhance the e ectiveness of air pollution treatment, changing electricity discharge mode and installing protective mechanisms.

The improved technology has obtained SEMI S2 safety certi cation and, after repeated testing, can be used for three stage pollutant treatment.

The rst stage is a washer that transmits gaseous acid alkaline liquid phases for decontamination.

The second stage is a particle collector that accumulates and removes particulate matter with corona discharge.

Finally, the gases which have been treated by wet EP would enter to the zeolite rotors for organic pollutant removing.

The three stage process can e ectively minimize acid alkaline gases, organic gases, and PM2.5 emissions simultaneously.

Results showed that the three stage process was able to remove 90% of alkaline gases, and 91% of PM2.5 which is the form of acid gases after reaction.

In the future, TSMC will continue to evaluate the feasibility and e cacy of wet EP applications to other exhaust gases to reduce air pollution emissions and strive toward zero emissions.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and per uorinated compounds (PFCs) are byproducts of wafer manufacturing.

Air pollution control equipment mainly uses pyrolysis to remove VOCs and PFCs.

However, this process also causes dinitrogen (N2) to react with oxygen (O2) in the air and produce nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) pollutants.

TSMC has launched a NOx reduction project in all facilities around the world to comply with assessment requirements for the new U.S. facility.

First, TSMC conducted survey and analysis for comprehensive stacks in the facilities.

Results showed that NOx is mainly produced by pyrolysis in local scrubbers and VOC control equipment.

To reduce NOx emissions, TSMC adapted the structure and treatment processes of thermal oxidizers in control equipment, adding swirler to introduce outside air into oxidizers to facilitate combustion.

Fuel sprinklers are also added for pre heating in stages.

In the rst stage, the oxygen concentration is be lower in the low temperature reaction.

In the second stage, the air with low oxygen concentration is introduced into the combustion.

Under the low oxygen combustion, ame temperature dip from 1,600 1,300 are used to change where exhaust gases enter into thermal oxidizers so that the gases can circumvent high temperature zones, which reduces the production of thermal NOx.

In 2022, TSMC tested the new process on VOC control equipment in the Fab 18 Phase 7 and was able to minimize target pollutants and NOx byproducts by simply adapting thermal oxidizers and using optimal temperatures.

The process does not compromise the performance of exhaust gas treatment and can reduce NOx emissions by 65% each year.

TSMC will continue to evaluate ways to improve local scrubbers to further reduce NOx production and strive for environmental friendly goals.

TSMC values its commitment to employees and works to foster a humanistic workplace culture with open communications.

The Company is dedicated to promoting a diverse, inclusive, safe, and fun workplace where employees can continue to learn.

Note 3: Hazard Identi cation and Assessment: Foster a safety culture where employees and the Company protect each other and encourage employees to speak up and o er suggestions for occupational safety.

Following the TSMC Safety and Health Policy, TSMC has implemented the following health and safety measures and used the Safety Performance Index (SPI) to track performance.

TSMC has strengthened employees' safety and health awareness through training, hoping to minimize the impact of unsafe environments or conduct.

An analysis of employee disabling injury statistics reveals that most injuries are caused by insu cient safety awareness and failure to implement management regulations.

To enhance safety culture, experts were commissioned to conduct a safety culture investigation in 2022, helping to identify the direction and improvement measures.

Safety culture is the consensus among workers on safety awareness, emphasis, and belief in the workplace, and it is also the foundation of a safe and healthy workplace.

In 2022, TSMC commissioned a professional international safety culture consulting rm to design a questionnaire based on four aspects: teamwork, safety communication, safety values, and organizational trust.

Focusing on plants with a disabling injury frequency rate and a disabling severity rate that have fallen below the Company average for three consecutive years, a frontend wafer processing plant and a backend chip packaging plant were chosen via sampling.

The survey targets included colleagues of production and non production units, covering di erent genders, age groups, seniorities, and grades a total of 2,568 questionnaires were sent out, and 1,776 valid questionnaires were retrieved, resulting in a response rate of 69.2%.

According to the analysis outcome, TSMC's safety culture was given a score of 4.8 points, indicating the Company is transitioning from being compliant to incorporating safety awareness into our values .

The top three topics of concern among the colleagues were intrinsically safe work environment, comprehensive and transparent safety related reporting procedures, and a team culture of looking out for each other .

The most recognized measures were feeling the management's high level of safety concern, quick adoption of improvement measures, ongoing work environment optimization, and understanding the importance of employees' physical and mental health The least satis ed aspects were the supervisor fails to proactively communicate safety related topics, the employees believe that they do not have the proper ability to cope with management related contingencies, the Company is advised to provide more safety awareness training.

To respond to the colleagues' topics of concern, the emphasis in 2023 will be placed on reinforcing employees' day to day safety awareness, safety communication, and developing diverse safety awareness training.

Corporate ESH Division will identify potential risks in the workplace and design bespoke safety and health training programs design Safety Moment programs to train seed personnel from various units publish new safety related knowledge every month to elevate everyone's safety awareness demand various departments to hold monthly workplace safety and health related problem discussions, where the seed personnel will report improvement suggestions back to the Corporate ESH Division in a bid to establish a company wide safety culture.

TSMC Safety Performance Index (SPI) is classified into four levels, including active and passive indices.

The active indices encourage employees to participate in health and safety activities while the passive index shows the number of safety related failures, false alarms, etc.

To implement the improvement measures for the prevention of false alarms, if the same false alarm occurs repeatedly in the same year, additional points will be deducted from the SPI.

In 2022, blue light indices (excellent) increased by 10.1% from 2021 to 86%.

The main improvement in the passive indices was reflected in the decrease in false alarms from 28 incidents in the previous years to 17 incidents this year, and the incident rate per 1,000 employees was reduced to 0.145 from 0.252 in 2021.

When a false alarm occurs, in addition to applying the 3L5W (Three Legged Five Whys) Tool to conduct an investigation, the Company also interviews relevant personnel, analyzes and inspects the equipment, and tests the materials using the false alarm reporting and investigation procedure.

Relevant documents and records are checked, or the scene is reconstructed to identify the direct, indirect, and fundamental cause of the incident to actively discover improvement opportunities and prevent similar incidents from occurring again.

Note: Starting from 2020, the incident rate per thousand individuals entering TSMC includes employees and contractors.

Note: Historical incidents by type per thousand individuals entering TSMC include employees and contractors.

Three incidents were caused by damaged gas early warning alarm components, and three incidents were caused by workers who did not observe the gas cylinder replacement procedures.

Construction site safety management is conducted through the three strategies of risk identi cation, management support, and execution review.

The digital transformation of occupational safety and health training is implemented, where relevant programs are launched by the TSMC Supplier Sustainability Academy.

In particular, high risk operation contractors must complete 100% of the training before entering the fabs to begin construction.

The safety design of the cleaning tank must include low liquid level detectors and overheat detectors that are not controlled by the process.

When the detectors are activated, they should be able to automatically turn o the heater when the overheat detector circuit is open and faulty, it should be regarded as an alarm, and the heater is automatically turned o .

To enhance the implementation of the construction personnel's safety regulations, minimize inattention related occupational disasters, and improve inspection manpower allocation and time consuming problems, TSMC has joined forces with National Chung Hsing University's Department of Management Information Systems in 2021 to develop Arti cial Intelligence (AI) Job Hazard Analysis Technology, integrating existing emergency response 4G cameras in the fabs with a wired or wireless network to transmit live images, apply intelligent identi cation technology to identify environmental and operational risks, as well as integrate big data computing and machine learning to monitor high risk workplaces.

The Emergency Response Center personnel can monitor safety blind spots via live images around the clock.

When construction workers operating in high risk areas exhibit unsafe behaviors or nd themselves in an unsafe environment, text messages or the public address system can be used to report the problem to TSMC project managers and Emergency Response Center, demanding the contractor to make immediate improvements.

The contractor may only resume construction after it has passed re inspection.

In 2022, the AI job hazard analysis technology was used in Fab 15A to monitor 1,402 ceiling operations, where three unsafe contractor behaviors were discovered in time during the test process to prevent occupational injuries.

Besides the ceiling, AI job hazard analysis technologies will be developed for other high risk workplaces.

The technology will be introduced to various fabs, and it will be standard equipment for new fabs.

Considering the diverse applications of AI technology, TSMC formed an internal image recognition development and review platform in 2022 to consolidate all AI image recognition system developments.

Units with image recognition needs can search and utilize the application resources that have already been developed on this platform to expand the scope and depth of disaster prevention technology.

Disclosure of occupational accidents is based on the Occupational Safety and Health Act and important disabling injury indicators issued by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which uses Disabling Severity Rate (SR) and Disabling Injury Frequency Rate (FR) as primary indicators.

In 2022, there were 35 disabling injuries among employees with 385 workdays lost.

Of these, 21 cases of disabling injuries among men resulted in the loss of 251 workdays, and 14 cases of disabling injuries among women resulted in the loss of 134 workdays.

Men su ered from a higher number of work related disabling injuries and workdays lost than women.

The types of injuries were mostly falls and impact injuries, mainly caused by accidental collisions due to poor route design or failure to pay attention to people in front when using trolleys or tripping injuries caused by the improper placement of materials when conducting machine maintenance operations.

Mostly caused by colleagues using trolleys in the 6 and 8 fabs.

Therefore, trolley routes and placement locations continue to be planned according to the operations involved, re ectors are installed in areas prone to collisions, and colleagues who voluntarily report incidents are rewarded.

Unsafe environments were improved and quarterly communication meetings were conducted in the manufacturing department to promote preventive safety awareness using di erent themes.

Mostly caused by missing a step in the clean room or tripping over objects during machine maintenance.

Consequently, the 6S standard for maintenance processes has been formulated, including guidelines for placing relevant components, materials, and covers during machine maintenance, as well as rules for xing extension cords and trolleys.

Note: Data includes TSMC fabs in Taiwan, TSMC (China), TSMC (Nanjing) injuries, disabilities, or deaths of workers caused by buildings, machinery, equipment, raw materials, materials, chemicals, gases, vapors, dust, etc., at the place of duty, or as a result of work activities, or due to other occupational causes.

In 2022, the contractor disabling injury frequency rate (FR) and disabling severity rate (SR) were higher compared to 2021.

This was mostly attributed to unsafe behaviors such as a lack of safety awareness or failure to follow SOPs.

Please refer to the Safety Performance Index for relevant improvement measures.

TSMC's comprehensive health management encompasses worker health promotion, health check ups, care, and occupational disease prevention.

These measures aim to control the work environment and personnel health risks to attain a work life balance.

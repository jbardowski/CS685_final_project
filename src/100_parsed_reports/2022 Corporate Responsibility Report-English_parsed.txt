Letter From Our Chairman & CEO
 

At Lowe's, we take pride in being one of the most trusted brands in America, and I'm grateful for  
the 300,000 associates whose hard work and dedication make that possible. 

We have earned this reputation by doing the right things for the right 

reasons, holding ourselves accountable for our words, decisions 

and actions, and being service-minded in our business. That's the 

our value chain, increasing product efficiency and transitioning to 
renewable energy sources. We are seizing on our unique position to help 
transform the residential sector by providing more efficient products, 

For our efforts and 
advancements in environmental, 
social and governance 

foundation of our approach to being a good corporate citizen and 

educational resources and opportunities for homeowners to advance 

practices, we were named to 

our commitment to preserving our shared environment by acting 

their personal sustainability journeys. 

responsibly, ethically, transparently and sustainably. To that end, I am 

pleased to share Lowe's 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report. You'll 

find updates on our three-pillar corporate responsibility strategy — 

Our People & Our Communities, Product Sustainability and Operational 

Excellence — and our measurable, actionable commitments. 

With total fiscal year 2022 sales of over $97 billion, with approximately 
$92 billion generated in the United States, and a more than $3 billion 
investment in incremental wage and share-based compensation for 
our frontline associates since 2018, Lowe's is continuing our journey to 

become the employer of choice in retail and a world-class, customer-
centric, omnichannel retailer. 

This journey includes our goal to reach net-zero emissions across the 
company's scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. 
Embarking on this journey demonstrates our commitment to a better, 
more sustainable future. 

Achieving this goal will require strong collaboration — from suppliers 
to customers — and a determined focus on reducing the impact of

We have a responsibility to the customers and communities we serve. 
That's why we've invested more than $400 million in local communities 
since 2018, which includes the newly launched Lowe's Hometowns grant 

program, a five-year $100 million investment. In 2022, more than 1.4 

million people are estimated to have benefitted from our 100 signature 
projects within the year following their completion.1  

And our commitment to our people and communities extends 
beyond that. Through financial grants, product donations, associate 
volunteerism, nonprofit partnerships and more, we are making 
meaningful and long-lasting impacts. 

Associate safety remains a priority enterprisewide with our Lowe's Safe 
initiatives yielding positive results. We're pleased that in 2022, our lost 
time incident rate (LTIR) dropped to 1.78 from 2.21 in 2021. In the year 

ahead, we'll continue to focus on what matters most: the safety and 
well-being of our associates and customers.

Index for North America for 

the fourth consecutive year. 
While we're proud of these 

accomplishments, Lowe's has a culture of continuous improvement. 

We seek opportunities to improve operational efficiency, offer safer 

and more eco-friendly products, support our local communities and 

maintain a diverse, healthy, skilled and engaged workforce. 

The Lowe's mission is "together, deliver the right home improvement 
products, with the best service and value, across every channel

Stakeholder Engagement 
& ESG Priorities 

ENGAGING OUR STAKEHOLDERS 
Lowe's proactively and regularly engages with our internal and external 

stakeholders — those groups who impact or are impacted by Lowe's 

operations — to better understand their needs and concerns, and to guide 

our strategic decision-making. Lowe's actively collaborates with suppliers, 

associates, shareholders, customers, local communities, industry associations, 

government entities, academia and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) 

to monitor and respond to emerging challenges, trends and opportunities. 

PRIORITIZATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL 
AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) TOPICS 
Understanding the priorities and expectations of our stakeholders plays 

an important role in how we set our strategies and goals as a responsible 

business. We last refreshed our ESG priority topics in 2020 when we engaged 

a third party to assist with facilitating our assessment. As part of that process, 

we conducted interviews (and validated our results) with Lowe's executives 

and researched sustainability topics important to suppliers, associates, 

shareholders, customers, local communities, industry associations, government 

entities, academia and NGOs. 

The results of our 2020 prioritization form the basis of the three pillars of our 

strategy: Our People & Our Communities, Product Sustainability and 
Operational Excellence.

At Lowe's, we want to protect what matters, and we work hard to help associates and customers who work in or shop our locations return home safely, to the people they

changes that embrace these improvements. This method communicates 

our commitment to safety from leadership to frontline associates, leading to

Lowe's Safe Review Program 
Establishing a safety-first mindset and reinforcing safe behaviors 

are central to our incident reduction strategy, which directly helps 

reduce the number of injuries at our stores. 

We employ the Lowe's Safe Review (LSR) program, a daily electronic 

safety inspection that is completed using handheld mobile devices. 

In addition to identifying hazards and tracking their correction, the 

LSR platform enables us to review analytics and data regarding 

the daily condition of stores and the steps taken to address issues. 

As part of our LSR program, Lowe's uses a root-cause analysis 

to help leaders take charge of safety at their stores. Our store 

managers create their own store-specific action plan with support 

from leadership, including simple, coachable steps to make their 

operations as safe as possible. 

In addition, the LSR is available to district managers and senior 

asset protection officers so they can provide documented 

feedback and support relating to safety. The program is part of a 

larger management system that delivers daily questions to keep 

associates updated on safety practices. The system captures 

participation and behavioral data to assess the effectiveness of 

our safety program. 

→  A  ngel Award  

Our Angel Award is given whenever a 
Lowe's associate saves a life while wearing

those efforts with 130 Angel Awards across 

the company.

programs and helps us expand our focus to prevent much rarer but 

reducing incidents and the severity of incidents.  

more serious accidents. 

Safety Videos 
This year, we expanded our internal safety communication platform with  

more safety videos for associates. Almost 90% of our store associates  

engaged with the platform this year, producing relevant, timely and  

credible store-level feedback that leadership can use to provide more  

insightful and topical safety communications and trainings.  

New Equipment 
Through ongoing communication and collaboration, Lowe's evaluates  

potential investments in equipment to keep associates and customers  

safe. In 2022, we invested more than $15 million in safety equipment  

aimed at reducing associate risk exposure, including new investments  

in electric pallet jacks, dock locks and paint carts. In addition to the new  

equipment that is deployed, the safety team is also included in process  

design  when  others  deploy  equipment, displays or new processes  

throughout the organization. 

Safety Training, Emergency Response 
In 2022, we trained nearly 7,000 associates in first aid and CPR, a two-

year certification provided to five associates per location. In addition, 
we recognized 130 associates with Angel Awards for responses ranging 

from administering CPR to using Automated External Defibrillators 

(AEDs) while wearing their Lowe's red vests. 

Other plans include continuing to deploy our  

dock lock system at all DCs and developing and  
implementing additional safety equipment to  

better protect our associates. We will also focus 

our safety communications and training on  

power equipment, including their safe operation 

and maintenance.

efforts to be an employer of choice and   
offer jobs that people seek out. The criteria  
used for this award includes investment value,  
quality of management and products, social  
responsibility and ability to attract talent. 

Attracting Top Talent 
Attracting top talent means providing our associates 
with opportunities to develop, thrive and progress at 
Lowe's. With over 52,000 unique roles and a focus on 
retaining and growing our associates, people from 
all backgrounds and experiences can find their ideal 
role and achieve success at Lowe's. As our business

Career Development 
While attracting top talent is essential, Lowe's 

strives to help grow meaningful careers for our 

associates by supporting the development of 

skills and confidence needed to thrive in Lowe's 

roles. In offering more than 3.5 million training 
activities per month, we develop our associates 
through upskilling and leadership training as they 
become more proficient in their current roles. Our 
goal is to provide associates with the opportunity 

for a successful career with Lowe's as part of our 
focus on internal talent. In 2022, this approach 
had outstanding results: We filled over 80% of our 
leadership positions internally. 

Educational Opportunities 
We believe greater access to education leads to 
more opportunities. Associates have access to 

select 100% tuition-free educational programs and

Whether starting with foundational learning, 
including high school completion, college readiness

teams who make decisions to sustainably 

source natural resources that meet 

our product requirements. Lowe's legal 

team provides vendors with training on 

the Vendor Code of Conduct and other 

requirements related to ethics and integrity. 

The Vendor Code of Conduct details social

vendor agreement, and our QA team 

conducts regular training sessions with 

vendors on various topics.

2022, Lowe's conducted all vendor and factory trainings virtually. 

Supplier Compliance 
We audit factories for Lowe's private brand suppliers and products 

where we are the importer of record to verify compliance with our 

Vendor Code of Conduct. Our audits focus on areas such as forced 

labor, labor contracts, working hours, compensation and benefits, 

employment practices, environmental compliance and worker health 

and safety. Lowe's Vendor Code of Conduct and our Human Rights 

Policy are the foundation of the audit and our Responsible Sourcing 

program. This program is carried out by conducting a Retail Ethical 

Sourcing Assessment (RESA) at each applicable factory by third-party 

audit firms to support impartial reviews.

Supplier Improvement and Ownership Plans 
Lowe's is focused on helping suppliers understand how to 

adhere to our Vendor Code of Conduct. If we encounter 

a compliance issue with a vendor's factory, we help them 

develop corrective action plans to meet their local and 

Lowe's compliance requirements. To accomplish this, 

we engage third-party experts to design and implement 

management systems to address the identified concerns. 

If the compliance issue is significant, and the vendor fails to 

correct it, we may terminate the business relationship.  

2023 PLANS 

We plan to continue to perform supplier factory audits 

and follow up on and validate corrective actions as part 

of our audit program. We began providing in-person 

trainings in 2023 and plan to continue that approach. 

VENDOR CODE OF CONDUCT 

Our Vendor Code of Conduct applies to vendors providing goods and services to Lowe's, our subsidiaries and our affiliates.  

The Code sets forth the basic standards of ethical conduct in business practices and our sustainability requirements and  

expectations, which vendors must comply with as a prerequisite to doing business with Lowe's. 

The Vendor Code of Conduct covers the following aspects of our vendor relationships:

the principles embedded in our business operations. This policy also embodies our commitment to respect internationally  

recognized human rights standards including the fundamental principles of Human Rights as defined by the Universal  

Declaration of Human Rights. Lowe's policies and vendor requirements are informed by the principles set forth in the United  

Nations Global Compact, the International Bill of Human Rights (including the International Covenant on Civil and Political

With the understanding that the resources of our planet are limited, Lowe's strives to sustainably source our materials. By tracking the origin of the resources we choose 
for our products, Lowe's is diligent in upholding our commitment to environmental stewardship.

directors annually. 

Responsible Forestry 
We continue to partner with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to uphold 

our responsible sourcing goals. Under its guidance, we strive for best 

practices in forestry by assessing emerging risks to help lessen the 

ecological impacts of the business and reduce deforestation. 

Lowe's is a member of Forests Forward, a corporate program managed 

by the WWF, which engages companies around the world to develop 

both long-term and near-term strategies to reduce their forest footprints 

and support other on-the-ground actions, including forest restoration, 

to keep forests thriving for people, nature and the climate. We look 

forward to collaborating with other retailers as part of Forests Forward to 

collectively build resilient supply chains for forestry products. 

Conflict Minerals 
Lowe's recognizes the concerns associated with sourcing conflict 

minerals. We expect vendors to comply with our Conflict Minerals 

Policy, which was established considering the United States Securities 

and Exchange Commission's (SEC) conflict minerals rule as mandated 
by Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 

Protection Act of 2010. We survey our private brand vendors 

annually to validate compliance with our policy and report in line 

with SEC regulations.

Commitment to Forestry Certification in Canada 
In 2022, we reviewed our forestry footprint and wood sourcing practices to assess how 
we could increase the scale, pace and rigor of our efforts to eliminate wood linked to 
deforestation and the degradation of primary forests within our supply chain. Based on 
our assessment, Lowe's committed to requiring all wood products sourced from Canada 
to originate from credible third-party-certified forests by 2027. 

In 2023, we plan to strengthen our Wood Sourcing Policy by updating the regions at risk and 

adding a provision that encourages all vendors to engage in Free, Prior and Informed Consent 

where applicable. We also plan to implement a grievance mechanism focused on our forestry 

supply chain and launch new investments in reforestation and forest restoration. Additionally, we 

will continue to engage with peer organizations via the WWF to drive responsible wood sourcing 

and sustainable forest management practices.

risk (Class-2) products, such as nails and screws, are tested every two 

years. Third-party labs are also used for consumer-focused product tests 

to help our merchants make informed buying decisions. 

Packaging 
We are committed to working with our suppliers to use circular design 

principles that reduce our packaging footprint. To enable the circular 

economy and reduce waste, we aspire to design packaging that is 

recyclable, compostable or reusable. This includes strategic labeling to 

educate customers on how they can recycle several types of packaging. We 

accomplish this by adding the How2Recycle label, which aims to educate 

and empower consumers to properly dispose of product packaging. 

3D PRINTING FOR NEW-PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 

To help streamline the early stages of prototyping new products, 

we added 3D printing capabilities to our design processes in 2022. 

This allows us to digitally send printing instructions for new products 

Expanded Polystyrene Foam and Polyvinyl Chloride 
In 2023, we will make further progress on excluding expanded 

polystyrene foam (EPS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film from our 

private brand packaging. We will also continue to partner with 

suppliers to evaluate opportunities to eliminate waste and to design

where possible. Through our partnership with 

How2Recycle, we teamed up with municipal 

recycling facilities to add polypropylene, not 

commonly accepted by recycling programs, to the 

list of recyclable materials. We also introduced 

this labeling to our e-commerce cartons, covering 

over 50 unique cartons, totaling over 3.6 million 

units annually. 

Sustainability Toolkit

Net-Zero Emissions Roadmap 
The largest source of our emissions is tied to the lifecycle of the 

products we sell. We plan to create detailed roadmaps to reduce 

emissions across our diverse product portfolio aligned to our goal 

of reducing scope 3 emissions by 22.5% from 2021 levels. We will

Circular Economy 
Achieving a net-zero emissions goal requires us to 

manage and mitigate the environmental impacts of 

the waste we generate. As we continue to analyze 

methods of increasing the recyclability of our 

materials and products, we also evaluate how we 

can participate in the circular economy by turning 

the waste we produce into useful materials. 

To reduce the amount of waste that is directed to 

landfills, we are also taking steps to sort our waste 

into distinct categories. These better organized 

waste streams help us identify materials that may 

have value to others, find markets where we can 

send these materials and, occasionally, generate 

additional revenue. 

CIRCULAR ECONOMY PRODUCTS 

In 2022, we began our partnership with Trex as a 

plastic film and bag recycling partner. Trex reuses 

the clear, plastic film we collect to manufacture a 

new flooring product. Our partnership helps to divert 

waste from landfills while providing more sustainable 

materials for the products we sell. 

2022 ACCOMPLISHMENTS
 

Recycling at Our Regional Distribution Centers (RDCs)
 
We continued to add pallet grinders to our RDCs to expand our recycling capabilities. 

These grinders enable us to transition wood waste into mulch and reusable wood 

2023 PLANS 

To help us reduce waste sent to landfills 

and that waste's associated scope 3 

emissions, we plan to further leverage 

products. In the future, we may be able to transition our wood waste back into pallets. 

our waste data to improve processes and 

At other DCs, we continue to roll out Styrofoam densifiers, which are machines that allow 

identify trends. We also plan to ramp up 

our deployment of Styrofoam densifiers 

at our cross-dock terminals and provide 

technology to our DCs that allows them to 

use the HAZMAT application. 

material to be palletized, picked up and recycled. 

Improved Waste Management 
Understanding, managing and diverting waste from landfills is a priority. This year, we 

introduced policies and procedures that instruct stores when they can use open-top 

dumpsters that reduce our visibility into stores' waste streams and are costly to 

perpetually operate. 

Reverse Logistics Program 
To further reduce the amount of returned or damaged products sent to landfills, in 

2022, we introduced technology to track products that went back to our stores, vendors 

and DCs through our reverse logistics program. This helps create a centralized return 

repository, giving us more insight into what we can donate to local nonprofits and 

reducing the transportation needed to do so. Over the last three years, our reverse 

logistics program has diverted 35,000 tons of waste from landfills. 

HAZMAT Application 
In 2022, we launched our proprietary HAZMAT application to simplify, expedite and verify 

our processes for managing hazardous waste in our stores. This once-manual process 

is now done virtually and automatically through the app. The HAZMAT application 

provides compliance directions for safe storage and disposal of hazardous waste, and 

the app prints and logs all necessary documentation to regulatory standards. This saves 

worker hours, improves compliance and reduces costs.

Governance
 

Lowe's is committed to doing business with integrity, honesty and transparency. 

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 

Board Oversight 
Our board of directors and its five standing committees, 

each of which is composed of solely independent 

directors, are responsible for overseeing corporate 

strategy and risk management processes. In addition to 

oversight by the full board of directors, the board has also 

delegated primary responsibility for more frequent and 

in-depth oversight of the company's environmental and 

social strategy to its sustainability committee. The board 

also coordinates with its other committees to provide 

active board- and committee-level oversight of the 

company's management of environmental- and social-

related risks across the relevant committees. 

The following is a nonexclusive list of topics regularly 
reviewed by the board or its committees: 
→ Responsible sourcing and supply chain management
→ Sustainable consumer products
→ Environmental performance
→ GHG emissions and climate-change risks
→ Human capital strategy
→ Diversity and inclusion
→ Associate safety
→ Cybersecurity and data privacy
→ Political contributions and government affairs activities

→ Ethics and compliance

Political Involvement 
Lowe's generally does not make contributions from 
corporate funds to political campaigns, super political 
action committees (PACs) or political parties. We provide 
transparency by publishing annual reports of the company's 
political contributions and the aggregate dues paid to trade 
associations that engage in lobbying activities. We list trade 

associations to which our company makes yearly payments 
of $5,000 or more, and our PAC contributions are publicly 
available on the Federal Election Commission website. Our 
Political Engagement and Contributions Policy articulates our 
principles concerning political contributions, trade associations 
and lobbying activities. In the United States, our voluntary 
associate-led Lowe's Companies, Inc. political action committee 
(LOWPAC) raises money for political candidates to address 
issues relevant to the company's priorities and strategy. Lowe's 
government affairs (GA) team regularly assesses and evaluates 
the company's relationships with all current trade associations 
to align with the company's strategy. 

Our GA team actively participates and communicates with 
trade associations to help shape their agendas and priorities 
(e.g., serving on trade associations' boards) and to maintain 
real-time knowledge of their advocacy positions and policies. The 
nominating and governance committee of our board of directors 
has oversight of Lowe's GA activities, including lobbying priorities, 
trade association memberships and LOWPAC.

Compliance and Oversight 
Lowe's adopts physical, technological and administrative controls 

on data privacy and security. We leverage the National Institute of 

Standards (NIST) security and privacy frameworks as well as established 

internal security standards and industry best practices to drive our 

strategic direction and make continuous improvement. We comply 

with a range of applicable industry standards, such as the Payment 

Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Our data privacy and 
security policies and procedures are designed to incorporate industry 

best practices and applicable regulatory requirements. Lowe's regularly 

reviews and updates these policies.

parties, participate in compliance audits and run internal assessments 
conducted by full-time "red team" resources that test our systems for 

vulnerable points. These activities are benchmarked against standards that 

include NIST and PCI DSS, and we regularly evaluate program maturity with 

industry leaders. We also strive to follow the industry's best practices by 

monitoring and adopting improved capabilities and best practices.

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 2022 Report
 

This report follows the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the leading framework for promoting more informed investment decisions related to a 

company's exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities. 

This report summarizes how we assess risks and opportunities associated with 
climate change and our actions to date, and it is structured around the four 
TCFD elements describing how organizations operate: governance, strategy, risk 
management and metrics and targets. 

GOVERNANCE 

A) Describe the board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities. 
Our board of directors views oversight and effective management of 
environmental and social issues and their related risks as important to the 
company's ability to execute our strategy and achieve long-term sustainable 
growth. The board receives regular updates on environmental and social topics 
from our vice president of corporate sustainability. In addition to oversight by the 
full board of directors, the board has also delegated primary responsibility for 
more frequent and in-depth oversight of the company's environmental and social 
strategy to the sustainability committee. 

The key functions of the sustainability committee include: 

→ Assisting the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility by evaluating and 

monitoring the environmental, social and related public policy trends that could 
affect the company's business activities and performance 

→ Reviewing, discussing and providing feedback to management on company 
programs, policies and practices pertaining to the company's environmental 
and social responsibility issues and impacts to support the sustainable growth 
of the company 

→ Discussing with management the company's plans for maintaining and 

B)  Describe management's role in assessing and managing risks 

STRATEGY 

and opportunities. 

Our sustainability steering committee, which is composed of certain officers 
and business unit divisional leaders, is led by Lowe's executive vice president of 
merchandising and assists with evaluation and the oversight of climate-related risks 
and opportunities. The sustainability council, which is composed of cross-functional 
Lowe's stakeholders, is led by Lowe's vice president of corporate sustainability and 
identifies and evaluates Lowe's climate-related risks and opportunities. The key 
functions of these management committees are described below. 

Sustainability Steering Committee 

To evaluate the potential impacts of climate change-related risks and opportunities 
on our business strategy, we utilize multiple climate science-based scenarios 
commonly used in conjunction with the TCFD framework: 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change RCP8.5 
This scenario represents a future where minimal action is taken to mitigate global 
warming. Physical stressors, such as hurricanes, temperature rise and wildfires are 
more frequent and severe in this scenario. Lowe's selected this scenario to better 
understand the impact of extreme climate stressors on our value chain. 

→   Reviewing identified environmental, social and related public policy trends,  

issues, risks (including climate-related risks) and concerns  
→ Reviewing Lowe's sustainability-related goals and strategies 
→ Monitoring performance against external sustainability indices 
→ Reviewing the annual Corporate Responsibility Report 
→   Reviewing and providing recommendations on programs, policies and practices  

pertaining to environmental and social responsibility issues and impacts to  
support the sustainable growth of Lowe's 

Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios (Net Zero 
2050/Below 2°C/Nationally Determined Contributions) 
These scenarios represent a future where varying levels of action are taken to 
mitigate global warming through policy changes to incentivize a cleaner and 
more efficient global infrastructure. The most significant stressors in these 
scenarios are related to the rapid transition to a low-carbon economy. Lowe's 
selected multiple scenarios to better understand the range of outcomes that 
could result from this transition.

A)  Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization 

has identified over the short, medium and long term. 

Through our scenario-based approach, we identified risks and opportunities related 
to stressors associated with each scenario. We then evaluated the potential impacts 
of those stressors in different scenarios over a 30-year time horizon. The following 
risks and opportunities were assessed during our scenario analysis:

METRICS AND TARGETS 

organization's businesses, strategy and financial planning.

Lowe's mission is to deliver the right home improvement products, with the best 
service and value, across every channel and community we serve. The climate-
related risks identified in the tables on page 58 have the potential to impact 
our business in a number of ways, including increasing operational expenses, 
increasing the cost of the products we sell, disrupting our supply chain and 
impacting the mix of products we offer to our customers. There are also several 
business opportunities in the scenarios we reviewed, including the transition of the 
residential sector to a low-carbon future and the reduction of operating expenses 
through investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Both the risks 
and opportunities identified in this report are taken into consideration during the 
organization's strategic and financial planning processes. 

In 2022, Lowe's committed to a goal of reaching net-zero emissions across 
scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2050. The steps required to achieve this commitment aim 
to accelerate the decarbonization of our value chain while contributing to the 
reduction of global GHG emissions. The opportunities identified in this assessment 
have been part of our strategy as the company has focused on driving operational 
efficiency and delivering the best products to our customers. 

C) Describe the resilience of the organization's strategy, taking into

consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C
or lower scenario.

Over the years, Lowe's has adjusted our business model and product mix to adapt 
to changing customer needs and market conditions. In each scenario we reviewed, 
we identified a balance of opportunity and risk that reflects the resilience of our 
business model. For example, the stressors identified in the RCP8.5 scenario have 
the potential to disrupt our supply chain and operations, but they also create an 
opportunity for Lowe's to provide customers with the products and services they 
need to repair damage from severe weather events and prepare their homes 
for future events. In 2°C or lower scenarios, product efficiency requirements and 
carbon tax schemes have the potential to increase product and operational 
costs, but they also have the potential to increase revenues as customers work 
to decarbonize their homes. Lowe's will continue to focus on improving energy 
efficiency within our own operations and product mix while accelerating our 
efforts to reduce emissions and build resilience throughout our value chain. 

A) Describe the organization's processes for identifying and assessing

climate-related risks.

A)  Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks 
and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process. 

Lowe's leveraged the following methodology to identify and assess our climate-
related risks: 

→ Prioritized specific topics for a scenario analysis 
→ Assessed public climate scenarios and pathways to determine best scenarios 

for analysis 

→ Used internal and external research to determine climate-related stressors 
→ Quantified each risk and opportunity via scenario-analysis to better understand 

the impact on the business 

Qualitative criteria considered substantive based on financial or strategic impact are: 

→ Changes to sales or revenue across a group of products or enterprise 
→ Expenses or capital expenditures are increased 
→ Noncompliance with external legal or regulatory requirements 
→ Corporate initiative, functional objective or project goals are not met 
→ Negative impact on individuals' (associates'/customers') health and safety or to 

the environment 

→ Public view of Lowe's brand is negatively impacted 

Lowe's is focused on risks and opportunities across the short term (0-3 years), medium 
term (3-6 years) and long term (6+ years), spanning from 2021 to 2050 and beyond.

The primary responsibility for the identification, assessment and management 
of the various risks we face belongs to Lowe's management. At the management 
level, risks are prioritized and assigned to senior leaders based on the risk's 
relationship to the leader's business area and focus. The senior leaders develop 
plans to address the risks and measure the progress of risk management efforts. 

C) D  escribe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing   

climate-related risks are integrated into the organization's overall   
risk management. 

Our executive vice president, chief legal officer and corporate secretary provides 
centralized oversight of Lowe's enterprise risk management program, which 
includes the Enterprise Risk Council (ERC) composed of senior leaders with broad 
enterprise experience. The ERC supports the execution of the enterprise risk 
management program by (i) working to identify, assess and categorize existing 
risks faced by the company, (ii) identifying senior leaders responsible for managing 
such risks and (iii) evaluating action plans and progress to appropriately manage 
those risks. Currently, climate risks are integrated within the enterprise risk 
management framework.

Lowe's proactively and regularly engages with our internal and external stakeholders those groups who impact or are impacted by Lowe's operations to better understand their needs and concerns, and to guide our strategic decision making.

Lowe's actively collaborates with suppliers, associates, shareholders, customers, local communities, industry associations, government entities, academia and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to monitor and respond to emerging challenges, trends and opportunities.

Understanding the priorities and expectations of our stakeholders plays an important role in how we set our strategies and goals as a responsible business.

We last refreshed our ESG priority topics in 2020 when we engaged a third party to assist with facilitating our assessment.

As part of that process, we conducted interviews (and validated our results) with Lowe's executives and researched sustainability topics important to suppliers, associates, shareholders, customers, local communities, industry associations, government entities, academia and NGOs.

The results of our 2020 prioritization form the basis of the three pillars of our strategy: Our People Our Communities, Product Sustainability and Operational Excellence.

As Lowe's strives to deliver the best products and solutions to our customers, our sustainability strategy focuses on responsible sourcing safer and more environmentally friendly products maintaining a diverse, healthy, engaged and skilled workforce supporting our local communities and operating efficiently, ethically and responsibly.

We also continue to find new ways to contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (p. 10) and expand our program to help us contribute to those targets.

As part of our efforts to minimize our environmental impact, we seek to divert waste from landfills where possible by promoting recycling and finding new uses for spent materials.

Managing our waste streams and their associated scope 3 emissions is a key component to achieving our net zero goal.

Lowe's is also reducing the amount of returned or damaged products much of our waste streams as possible to increasing recycling rates and providing customers with recycling identify where our waste is generated and options that help to reduce their waste streams at home.

To achieve this, sent to landfills through our reverse logistics program.

By leveraging centralized reverse hubs in the United States, products previously opportunities to recycle and implement we are incorporating circular economy principles into our operations and destined for landfills are transported from stores back to our DCs for circular economy principles.

Diverting and Recycling Waste We partner with suppliers to improve recycling and waste diversion, develop regional management processes, measure waste streams and nonprofits to divert unsold products resulting from category resets to be used in their homebuilding and renovation projects, helping to support their mission while reducing waste to landfill.

Hazardous Waste Management Our internal hazardous waste protocols, based on U.S. regulations and and national partnerships where possible.

We also operate in store industry best practices, promote responsible management, transport and recycling centers for customers to recycle items, including compact disposal of all hazardous materials.

We regularly examine new ways of fluorescent lamps, rechargeable batteries, plastic planter pots and improving our technologies and processes to enhance the classification cell phones.

Circular Economy Achieving a net zero emissions goal requires us to manage and mitigate the environmental impacts of the waste we generate.

As we continue to analyze methods of increasing the recyclability of our materials and products, we also evaluate how we can participate in the circular economy by turning the waste we produce into useful materials.

To reduce the amount of waste that is directed to landfills, we are also taking steps to sort our waste into distinct categories.

These better organized waste streams help us identify materials that may have value to others, find markets where we can send these materials and, occasionally, generate additional revenue.

In 2022, we began our partnership with Trex as a plastic film and bag recycling partner.

Trex reuses the clear, plastic film we collect to manufacture a new flooring product.

Our partnership helps to divert waste from landfills while providing more sustainable materials for the products we sell.

Recycling at Our Regional Distribution Centers (RDCs)  We continued to add pallet grinders to our RDCs to expand our recycling capabilities.

To help us reduce waste sent to landfills and that waste's associated scope 3 emissions, we plan to further leverage products.

In the future, we may be able to transition our wood waste back into pallets.

At other DCs, we continue to roll out Styrofoam densifiers, which are machines that allow identify trends.

We also plan to ramp up our deployment of Styrofoam densifiers at our cross dock terminals and provide technology to our DCs that allows them to use the HAZMAT application.

Improved Waste Management Understanding, managing and diverting waste from landfills is a priority.

This year, we introduced policies and procedures that instruct stores when they can use open top dumpsters that reduce our visibility into stores' waste streams and are costly to perpetually operate.

This helps create a centralized return repository, giving us more insight into what we can donate to local nonprofits and reducing the transportation needed to do so.

Over the last three years, our reverse logistics program has diverted 35,000 tons of waste from landfills.

HAZMAT Application In 2022, we launched our proprietary HAZMAT application to simplify, expedite and verify our processes for managing hazardous waste in our stores.

This once manual process is now done virtually and automatically through the app.

The HAZMAT application provides compliance directions for safe storage and disposal of hazardous waste, and the app prints and logs all necessary documentation to regulatory standards.

This saves worker hours, improves compliance and reduces costs.

This report follows the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the leading framework for promoting more informed investment decisions related to a company's exposure to climate related risks and opportunities.

This report summarizes how we assess risks and opportunities associated with climate change and our actions to date, and it is structured around the four TCFD elements describing how organizations operate: governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets.

A) Describe the board's oversight of climate related risks and opportunities.

Our board of directors views oversight and effective management of environmental and social issues and their related risks as important to the company's ability to execute our strategy and achieve long term sustainable growth.

The board receives regular updates on environmental and social topics from our vice president of corporate sustainability.

In addition to oversight by the full board of directors, the board has also delegated primary responsibility for more frequent and in depth oversight of the company's environmental and social strategy to the sustainability committee.

Our sustainability steering committee, which is composed of certain officers and business unit divisional leaders, is led by Lowe's executive vice president of merchandising and assists with evaluation and the oversight of climate related risks and opportunities.

The sustainability council, which is composed of cross functional Lowe's stakeholders, is led by Lowe's vice president of corporate sustainability and identifies and evaluates Lowe's climate related risks and opportunities.

The key functions of these management committees are described below.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change RCP8.5 This scenario represents a future where minimal action is taken to mitigate global warming.

Physical stressors, such as hurricanes, temperature rise and wildfires are more frequent and severe in this scenario.

Lowe's selected this scenario to better understand the impact of extreme climate stressors on our value chain.

Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios (Net Zero 2050 Below 2 C Nationally Determined Contributions) These scenarios represent a future where varying levels of action are taken to mitigate global warming through policy changes to incentivize a cleaner and more efficient global infrastructure.

The most significant stressors in these scenarios are related to the rapid transition to a low carbon economy.

Lowe's selected multiple scenarios to better understand the range of outcomes that could result from this transition.

The charter for the sustainability committee can be found here.

A) Describe the climate related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium and long term.

Through our scenario based approach, we identified risks and opportunities related to stressors associated with each scenario.

We then evaluated the potential impacts of those stressors in different scenarios over a 30 year time horizon.

The opportunity to reduce operating expenses by implementing innovative new technologies.

Reduced operating expenses through the implementation of new energy saving or emissions reducing technologies in our operational footprint.

New product efficiency regulations could result in increased product costs.

The magnitude of the potential risk varies based on how aggressively these policies are implemented.

In December 2022, Lowe's committed to a goal of reaching net zero emissions across scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2050 to accelerate the decarbonization of our value chain.

Lowe's regularly evaluates new opportunities to increase the resilience of our facilities, improve energy and water efficiency, and also evaluates our product mix to meet changing seasonal needs.

Lowe's regularly evaluates supplier location and exposure to identify potential risk areas.

We then focus on supplier diversification in those regions to minimize potential disruptions to our supply chain.

New product efficiency regulations or increased warming of the climate could result in increased consumer demand for products that require less water or energy to perform a similar function.

Increased heat levels could also lead to incremental sales of products to improve the energy efficiency of the home.

Increased severity and frequency of acute events could result in increased demand for products that improve the climate resilience of homes.

Lowe's regularly evaluates new technologies to address primary sources of energy use and emissions within our operational footprint.

Lowe's continues to expand our portfolio of energy and water efficient products to provide customers options in line with demand.

Lowe's continues to evaluate new product offerings to improve climate resilience while educating our customers on the best ways to protect their homes from the impacts of severe weather events.

Lowe's mission is to deliver the right home improvement products, with the best service and value, across every channel and community we serve.

The climate related risks identified in the tables on page 58 have the potential to impact our business in a number of ways, including increasing operational expenses, increasing the cost of the products we sell, disrupting our supply chain and impacting the mix of products we offer to our customers.

There are also several business opportunities in the scenarios we reviewed, including the transition of the residential sector to a low carbon future and the reduction of operating expenses through investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy.

Both the risks and opportunities identified in this report are taken into consideration during the organization's strategic and financial planning processes.

In 2022, Lowe's committed to a goal of reaching net zero emissions across scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2050.

The steps required to achieve this commitment aim to accelerate the decarbonization of our value chain while contributing to the reduction of global GHG emissions.

The opportunities identified in this assessment have been part of our strategy as the company has focused on driving operational efficiency and delivering the best products to our customers.

C) Describe the resilience of the organization's strategy, taking into consideration different climate related scenarios, including a 2 C or lower scenario.

Over the years, Lowe's has adjusted our business model and product mix to adapt to changing customer needs and market conditions.

In each scenario we reviewed, we identified a balance of opportunity and risk that reflects the resilience of our business model.

For example, the stressors identified in the RCP8.5 scenario have the potential to disrupt our supply chain and operations, but they also create an opportunity for Lowe's to provide customers with the products and services they need to repair damage from severe weather events and prepare their homes for future events.

In 2 C or lower scenarios, product efficiency requirements and carbon tax schemes have the potential to increase product and operational costs, but they also have the potential to increase revenues as customers work to decarbonize their homes.

Lowe's will continue to focus on improving energy efficiency within our own operations and product mix while accelerating our efforts to reduce emissions and build resilience throughout our value chain.

A) Describe the organization's processes for identifying and assessing climate related risks.

A) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process.

Lowe's is focused on risks and opportunities across the short term (0 3 years), medium term (3 6 years) and long term (6 years), spanning from 2021 to 2050 and beyond.

B) Describe the organization's processes for managing climate related risks.

The primary responsibility for the identification, assessment and management of the various risks we face belongs to Lowe's management.

At the management level, risks are prioritized and assigned to senior leaders based on the risk's relationship to the leader's business area and focus.

The senior leaders develop plans to address the risks and measure the progress of risk management efforts.

C) D escribe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate related risks are integrated into the organization's overall risk management.

Our executive vice president, chief legal officer and corporate secretary provides centralized oversight of Lowe's enterprise risk management program, which includes the Enterprise Risk Council (ERC) composed of senior leaders with broad enterprise experience.

The ERC supports the execution of the enterprise risk management program by (i) working to identify, assess and categorize existing risks faced by the company, (ii) identifying senior leaders responsible for managing such risks and (iii) evaluating action plans and progress to appropriately manage those risks.

Currently, climate risks are integrated within the enterprise risk management framework.

B) Disclose scope 1, scope 2 and, if appropriate, scope 3 GHG emissions and the related risks.

Carbon tax and efficiency standards resulting in increased operational costs.

Carbon tax and efficiency standards resulting in increased operational costs.

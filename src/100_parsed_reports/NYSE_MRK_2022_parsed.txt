About this report

This is the 2022/2023 Impact Report of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA, which is known as MSD 
outside the United States (U.S.) and Canada. All data is current as of December 31, 2022, unless

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023A letter from our CEO

Dear Stakeholders, 

Thank you for your interest in Merck and our ongoing 
commitment to operating responsibly and creating value for 
patients, our stakeholders and our business. We continue to 
take inspiration from our purpose and our unique opportunity 
to use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve 
lives around the world. 

Sustainable value creation is core to how we do business as 
we work to advance global health, apply innovative science 
and ultimately protect and improve the health of people and 
animals through the development and delivery of medicines, 
vaccines and technology solutions. We are passionate about 
this work and committed to making a positive difference for 
patients and the world while driving strong business outcomes. 
Working globally as One Team, we organize our sustainability 
efforts across four focus areas to create long-term value: 
1) expanding access to health; 2) developing and rewarding 
a diverse, inclusive and healthy workforce; 3) protecting the 
environment; and 4) operating with the highest standards of 
ethics and values.

Expanding access to health 

Two years ago, we set a goal to enable 100 million more people 
to access our innovative portfolio globally, through access 
strategies, solutions and partnerships, by 2025. We exceeded 
this goal already in 2022. As a result, we increased our ambition 
and more than tripled our original goal. We now aim to enable 
350 million more people to access our innovative portfolio 
by 2025.  

We are eager to reach more people not only now, but in the 
years to come. To this end, we pursued new scientific discoveries 
with an investment last year of $13.5 billion in research and 
development. In total, our products and pipeline seek to address 
83 percent of the top 20 global burdens of diseases.

Robert M. Davis | Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

In 2022, our MECTIZAN® Donation Program turned 35 years old. 
The longest-running disease-specific drug donation program 
of its kind, this successful effort to combat river blindness and 
lymphatic filariasis reached nearly 360 million people last year. 
We also invested $38 million to advance health equity through 
initiatives like Merck for Mothers. These investments support 
our goal to reach over 30 million people in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs) and in U.S. underserved populations 
with our social investments, by 2025. We surpassed this goal as 
well in 2022. Our new goal is to reach over 50 million people in 
LMICs, underserved populations in the U.S. and, going forward, 
underserved populations in other high-income countries, 
by 2025.

Developing and rewarding a diverse, inclusive 
and healthy workforce

We are committed to investing in our colleagues and building 
a strong pipeline of talent as an employer of choice. Across our 
organization, we value diversity and inclusion as both an ethical 
and business priority. 

We are becoming even more inclusive in our hiring, working 
with organizations including OneTen, a business coalition 
striving to close the opportunity gap for Black workers without

meaningful career opportunities for diverse candidates, we 
posted about 900 job openings not requiring a four-year degree, 
which was twice as many as the previous year. In addition, 
in 2022 we hosted 90 student interns through Year Up, a 
nonprofit serving economically disadvantaged young people. 
Women represented more than half of our new hires globally, 
and in the United States, 47 percent of new hires came from 
underrepresented ethnic groups. 

We have a longstanding commitment to fair and equitable pay 
for all employees doing similar work. In the U.S., our 2022 study 
found that we had achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity 
for female and male employees, as well as non-white (including 
Black, Hispanic and Asian employees) and white employees. 
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends to our 
business partners. Last year, we spent $3.2 billion with diverse 
Tier 1 and 2 suppliers globally.

Protecting the environment

Our Company has a long history of environmental stewardship, 
and we believe a healthy planet is essential to improving health 
and protecting the sustainability of our business. As part of 
this work, we have committed to the Science Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi) to set a net-zero target for our greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions across our global operations (Scopes 1, 2, 3).

We know that each of our research, production and office 
facilities plays a role in achieving our goals for energy efficiency, 
waste reduction and overall sustainability. In 2022, we created a 
Waste Diversion Playbook to help sites contribute to our goals 
through local waste-diversion strategies, such as composting and 
recycling, and environmentally responsible procurement practices.

Operating with the highest standards of ethics and values 

We operate responsibly every day, holding ourselves to the 
highest standards of ethics and values. Our code of conduct 
defines our corporate character and helps us protect our 

reputation as a trustworthy company. We maintain 100 percent 
compliance to regulatory requirements for active incident 
monitoring, risk and harm analysis, and timely notification of 
data breaches. We also encourage employees to speak up and 
report potential concerns, ensuring our ethics and values are 
reflected in all we do. 

As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), 
Merck remains committed to improving our communities 
through our operations, aligning our efforts with the Ten 
Principles of the UNGC.

In late 2021, we announced the issuance of our first $1 billion 
sustainability bond to support initiatives and partnerships 
contributing to the advancement of the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals. Through June 2022, we 
allocated $760 million of the net proceeds toward social 
and green projects, in alignment with our sustainability 
financing framework.

While my colleagues and I are pleased by our 2022 progress, 
we remain committed to doing more to advance and protect 
the health of our employees, communities and planet. Indeed, 
I want to thank our colleagues and partners for the passion and 
expertise brought to this work every day. I am honored to work 
alongside such a talented and dedicated team. 

Thank you again for your interest in our Company’s progress 
and performance. We are excited for our future—and the 
unique opportunity we have to make a difference through 
our research, our medicines and vaccines, and our enduring 
commitment to sustainable innovation and value creation.

Very best regards,

Rob Davis  
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

How we operate

We manage the Company through two operating segments, 
Pharmaceutical and Animal Health.

The Pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical 
and vaccine products. Human health pharmaceutical products 
consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, generally sold by 
prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. 

The Company sells these products primarily to drug wholesalers 
and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed 
health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, 
pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Human health 
vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and 
adult vaccines, which are sold primarily to physicians, wholesalers, 
physician distributors and government entities.

The Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures 
and markets a wide range of veterinary pharmaceutical and 
vaccine products, as well as health management solutions and 
services, for the prevention, treatment and control of disease in 
all major livestock and companion animal species. The Company 
also offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification, 
traceability and monitoring products. Animal Health products are 
sold to veterinarians, distributors, animal producers, farmers and 
pet owners.

For more than 130 years, we've been dedicated to operating responsibly and creating value for society. That commitment is 
one of our ongoing strengths and core to our business, which is why operating responsibly  is part of the foundation of our 
Strategic Framework, denoting our commitment to enable a safe, sustainable and healthy future for people and communities.

We believe creating greater accountability for our sustainability strategy will help drive financial results and long-term 
shareholder value. This is why we added new measures to our 2023 Company Scorecard that link the compensation for a 
majority of our employees, including our executives, to certain key sustainability metrics in the areas of Access to Health 
and Employees.

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023ESG materiality assessment

Material topics

There are hundreds of ESG topics a company can focus on 
at any given moment. An ESG materiality assessment is the 
process through which our Company gathers information about 
the external landscape, and our internal priorities, in order to 
fine-tune this larger list down to the most important strategic 
topics for our Company to address.

Understanding and prioritizing the issues that matter most 
to our business and stakeholders enables us to focus, act 
and report on them effectively and transparently. Our ESG 
materiality assessment process helps us to focus on potential 
business risks and opportunities that influence our ability 
to create value. It helps us determine where we should be 
prioritizing our efforts in order to maximize the benefit for 
our stakeholders, our Company and the world.

  To learn more about our ESG materiality process, please see page 49.

In our 2023 ESG materiality assessment, the following topics 
emerged as the most critical for our Company to address, and 
are grouped below by our four focus areas:

Access to Health

•  Access to health care and medicine (pages 54-76) 

•  Equity and affordability (pages 64-76) 

•  Product safety and quality

Development Goals (SDGs)

The SDGs represent the international community’s plan of 
action for “people, planet and prosperity.” The 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations 
Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace 
and prosperity for the planet and its people. At its core are the 
17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

We believe we have an important role and a responsibility 
to help reduce the burden of disease and improve access to 
medicines and vaccines around the world. That is why SDG 3 
(Good Health and Well-being) is at the heart of our business. 
It also aligns with our purpose to save and improve lives. 

While every SDG is essential to fostering sustainable 
development, we have prioritized eight goals where we 
believe we can have the biggest impact.

Access to Health

Access to Health is core to our Company’s purpose to use the 
power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around 
the world. We focus on discovering, developing and delivering 
innovative products and services that improve health and 
address unmet needs. We actively work in partnership with 
a range of stakeholders, including multilateral organizations, 
NGOs, and governments to strengthen health systems, doing 
our part to ensure care is affordable, efficient and equitable.

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023Discovery and invention

We build on our legacy of putting patients first by inventing 
medicines and vaccines to address unmet medical need, 
including for conditions with high global burden of disease. 
As part of our R&D strategy, we evaluate our candidates early 
for their potential to address significant public health concerns 
in underserved settings, including LMICs. 

Our research pipeline, products which we currently market, 
and our external collaborations seek to address 83 percent of 
the world’s top health burdens, including some that primarily 
affect LMICs. For example, our investigational vaccine for 
dengue fever is currently in a Phase 2 trial. With approximately 
half of the world’s population, or four billion people, at risk for 
dengue disease, dengue is a critical public health challenge. 
Annually, there are an estimated 105 million dengue infections 
worldwide; on average, 50-60 million of those cause symptoms. 
We also have a collaboration with Instituto Butantan to share 
data and learnings from our dengue vaccine programs.

In addition, we collaborate with academic institutions, 
nonprofit organizations, government entities and other 
biopharmaceutical companies, so we can follow the latest 
science and bring our medicines and vaccines to patients. 
In 2022, we entered into 97 significant external licenses, 
collaborations, and acquisitions with a broad range of partners, 
from early-stage science to clinical-stage programs. These 
collaborations are deemed “significant” because they involve 
an asset or technology with the potential to make an important 
enhancement to our R&D capabilities or potential portfolio.

Collaborating to fight infectious disease

We continue our strong legacy of infectious disease research, 
including for those diseases with greater impact to LMICs like 
tuberculosis (TB), HIV and malaria. 

In late 2022, Merck entered into a licensing agreement with 
the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute for two 
preclinical candidates with potential in combination regimens 
for treating TB, one of the top 10 causes of death in LMICs; 

one of these compounds advanced to a Phase 1 clinical trial 
earlier this year. Merck scientists discovered the compounds 
as part of the TB Drug Accelerator, a collaboration among 
biopharmaceutical companies, research organizations and 
universities to accelerate new TB therapies, supported by 
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

HIV is a global epidemic that disproportionately affects 
populations in LMICs in sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, two-thirds 
of the more than 35 million people living with HIV reside in the 
region, accounting for about 75 percent of HIV-related deaths, 
globally. Merck continues its more than 35 years of scientific 
research to address the HIV epidemic. We have a broad R&D 
program, including a Phase 3 development program for a new 
once-daily two-drug regimen and a Phase 2 study evaluating 
an investigational weekly oral combination treatment of our 
antiviral islatravir and Gilead Sciences’ lenacapavir, part of an 
agreement with Gilead to study long-acting HIV treatments. 
In addition, as part of our ongoing partnership with the 
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we recently began a Phase 1b 
study to evaluate potential mechanisms for an oral long-acting 
HIV prevention option. 

We continue to collaborate on new options for malaria, an 
infection with rising resistance to existing treatments and 
which remains one of the largest killers of pregnant women and 
children under the age of five in most resource-poor countries. 
A new antimalarial drug candidate, discovered through our 
longstanding collaboration with the Walter and Eliza Hall 
Institute of Medical Research in Australia and with funding from 
the Wellcome Trust, recently entered Phase 1 clinical testing.

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023A legacy of bettering human health 

We strive to discover treatments for diseases that affect people 
across a breadth of countries globally, such as cardiovascular 
disease. Merck has a long history of developing treatments for 
cardiovascular disease. More than 60 years ago, we introduced 
our first cardiovascular therapy and our scientific efforts to 
understand and treat cardiovascular-related disorders have 
continued, including with our investigational, once-daily oral 
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor 
in adults with hypercholesterolemia. Merck plans to start a 
Phase 3 pivotal study of the potential treatment in the second 
half of 2023.

Did you know?
Analysis from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation notes a 
growing global disease burden from chronic issues like high cholesterol.

Importantly, our discoveries often benefit human health over 
the long term, like the steroid dexamethasone, HIV treatment 
raltegravir and antihypertensive losartan, all of which remain 
on the World Health Organization’s Essential Medicines List 
decades after their discovery.14

Our R&D expenditure
In 2022, Merck’s R&D spend was $13.5 billion, making us a leader 
in funding R&D within the biopharmaceutical industry.

Reformulating our products for patient benefit

Innovation goes beyond new treatments. With a focus on improving 
adherence and enhancing the patient experience, we also strive 
to provide new options that increase the ease of administration. 
For example, in HIV, we are researching long-acting medications 
designed to reduce the frequency of administration.

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023Increasing diversity of patients in clinical trials

Availability

Clinical trials play a critical role in advancing scientific 
innovations. Our Company is determined to expand access 
to trials—including through increased diversity. In 2022, we 
reached more than 85,000 people through our clinical trials in 
more than 60 countries worldwide.

It will take a comprehensive approach to increase the diversity 
of participants in clinical trials, which is why we are tackling 
a variety of associated factors, many in partnership with 
other stakeholders. 

Our team of clinical trial operations experts implements 
best practices in our studies globally. For every late-stage 
trial, we require plans to recruit patients that appropriately 
reflect the diversity of the people who will ultimately take the 
medicines we make. We also prioritize placement of study 
sites in communities with higher populations of individuals 
who have historically been underrepresented in clinical trials. 
In 2022, approximately 50 percent of enrollees were from 
underrepresented groups. 

Partnerships are critical to increasing diversity in clinical 
trials. In 2022, we joined the Novartis-led collaboration 
Beacon of Hope, a 10-year program that establishes clinical 
trial Centers of Excellence at four Historically Black Medical 
Schools to increase diversity among clinical trial investigators 
and participants. We are also a contributor to sponsorships 
to connect with, support and train more clinicians from 
underrepresented groups.

To ease logistical barriers that make it difficult for some patients 
to visit clinical trial sites, we’re working with Greenphire, a 
provider of global financial lifecycle management solutions for 
clinical trials. The organization’s ClinCard debit card provides 
direct stipends and travel reimbursement. In addition, we 
have developed tools to reach study participants within their 
communities, including through local pharmacies and mobile 
study sites. 

 For more information, please see the Discovery & Invention section in 
GRI 203 on pages 54-57.

At Merck, we believe scientific innovation fuels long-term 
value to society. And to make those innovations as impactful 
as possible, we must also focus on strong commercialization, 
quality manufacturing, and operational excellence in our global 
supply distribution, while reducing our environmental impact. 

Our goal to reach at least 75 percent of countries in the world 
annually with our medicines and vaccines demonstrates 
our commitment to global product availability. In 2022, we 
surpassed our goal for the second consecutive year, reaching 
76 percent of countries around the world with our products.

76%
of countries reached with our 
products in 20224

Maintaining a global supply network 

Through our manufacturing and supply division, we strive to 
maintain a reliable global supply network of the highest quality. 
Our supply chain is designed to operate a lean and efficient 
network that produces our medicines and vaccines to the 
highest quality, safety and environmental standards, in full 
compliance with regulations and current Good Manufacturing 
Practices (cGMPs), as well as industry best practices. 

Through digitally enabled “end-to-end supply planning,” we are 
modernizing our manufacturing operations and conducting 
efficient and balanced planning to maximize business results 
and deliver medicines and vaccines to customers, when and 
where they need them. Our facilities, along with our external 
suppliers and partners, make up an integrated, interdependent 
global manufacturing network.

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023Developing new models and business strategies 
to expand access

From digital upgrades to blockchain technology, integrated 
access planning early in the product development cycle and 
planning for new manufacturing models, we are evolving 
systems to ensure broad availability of our medicines and 
vaccines to better meet patient needs. 

Manufacture and supply of vaccines

In the last few years, countries have introduced new 
or expanded routine vaccination programs, creating 
unprecedented increases in the global demand for vaccines. 
To meet this demand, we have increased our capacity and 
supply capability across our vaccines portfolio and are 
committed to continuing to do so.

 For more information, please see the Availability section in GRI 203 
on pages 58-63. 

Based on our 2022 
performance, we are 
increasing our access to 
health goal: We will enable
350 million 
more people 
to access our innovative 
portfolio through dedicated 
access strategies, solutions 
and partnerships, by 2025

“ We can never 
rest until a 
way has been 
found to bring 
our finest 
achievements 
to everyone.”

George W. Merck

Affordability 

Our purpose to deliver medicines and vaccines to save and 
improve lives is not fulfilled if our inventions cannot reach the 
people who most need them. It’s why we are committed to 
helping shape the health care ecosystem, ensuring people are 
empowered with the options to pursue high-quality, affordable 
medicines and vaccines, in a sustainable way.

Exceeding and expanding our goal to enable access 
to our innovative portfolio

In 2021, we set a goal to use strategies, solutions and 
partnerships to enable 100 million more people to access our 
innovative portfolio globally by 2025.5 In 2022, we were proud 
to exceed this goal, having enabled access for more than 
189 million people. This is why we are taking our goal further, 
increasing it to 350 million people by 2025.

We have made 
more than 
$2 billion 
in capital 
investments 
over the last five years 
to help increase supply

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023In addition, we are committed to engaging with global health 
organizations to improve the resilience of immunization programs 
and to advance equitable access to our vaccines, especially in 
LMICs. For example, through our long-term commitment to Gavi 
and UNICEF, we broaden access to our vaccines to help prevent 
HPV-related cancers and diseases in Gavi-supported countries 
by providing them at an accessible price.

Broadening the reach of our COVID-19 treatments

Access planning is a key part of our research and development 
process. One example is our global, multi-faceted strategy to 
facilitate timely and equitable access to our investigational 
antiviral COVID-19 medicine. This strategy was particularly 
important in the face of the global COVID-19 pandemic. 

Our strategy includes advance purchase and supply agreements 
with more than 40 countries; and voluntary license agreements 
with Indian generic manufacturers and the Medicines Patent 
Pool, enabling availability of generic versions of our investigational 
antiviral COVID-19 medicine to more than 100 LMICs. In addition, 
we allocated up to three million courses of therapy to UNICEF for 
LMICs as a “bridge strategy” until the voluntary licensees were 
able to produce supply. 

Thanks to this strategy, more than five million courses of 
our investigational antiviral COVID-19 medicine have been 
delivered to over 20 LMICs through 2022. In addition, Merck’s 
direct supply has treated more than four million patients 
worldwide through 2022. 

 For more information, please see the Affordability section in GRI 203 
on pages 64-69. 

We committed to provide 
over 100 million doses
of our HPV vaccine for use in Gavi-supported countries through 
a long-term agreement with UNICEF from 2021-2025

How we enable access

To advance our goal of enabling more people to access our 
innovative portfolio, we are focusing on building health 
care capacity, strengthening channels for care delivery and 
fostering sustainable financing. 

In building health care capacity, we help to create greater 
efficiency for patients in the health care system through 
collaborations with hospitals and health care networks. 
For example, we work with partners using a data-based 
approach to understand how a patient’s cancer journey can 
be optimized from earlier diagnosis through to treatment. 

We also collaborate with different financial institutions and 
payers, supporting them to expand funding options that help 
patients and their families cope with potentially high out-of-
pocket costs caused by critical illness. 

Through collaborations that reach underserved populations, 
we are working with health care providers and others in the 
digital health and financial sectors to develop solutions that 
enhance disease awareness and health care access.

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023A longstanding commitment to product donations

When market-based solutions are inadequate or unavailable, 
we pursue programs to provide direct access to our medicines 
and vaccines, including through product donations. One donation 
program we’re particularly proud of is our longstanding 
MECTIZAN Donation Program (MDP). For more than 35 years, 
the MDP has donated our medicine MECTIZAN for the treatment 
of onchocerciasis (known as river blindness) and, for more than 
25 years, also for the treatment of lymphatic filaraisis. MDP is 
the longest-running disease-specific drug donation program and 
partnership of its kind and is widely regarded as one of the most 
successful public-private health collaborations in the world. 

In 2022, we reached 
approximately 
359 million people 
with our MECTIZAN donations

Our Merck Medical Outreach Program (MMOP) is the primary 
way we donate our medicines and vaccines for global disaster 
relief and humanitarian assistance in LMICs. In 2022, we 
reached more than 118,000 people through the MMOP.

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023Making pregnancy and childbirth safer 

Maternal health outcomes can serve to shine a light on the 
strength of a health system. In many countries, inequitable 
maternal health outcomes persist despite having preventable 
causes. Merck for Mothers is our $650 million global initiative 
to create a world where no woman has to die while giving life. 
For more than a decade, the program has brought Merck’s 
scientific and business expertise to help make maternal health 
outcomes more equitable and pregnancy and childbirth safer.

 For more information, please visit the Merck for Mothers website.

Based on our 2022 performance, we are increasing  
our health equity goal: By 2025, we aim to reach 
50 million people
in LMICs and underserved populations in high-income 
countries with our social investments

Health systems strengthening 
and addressing health equity

To save and improve lives with our medicines and vaccines, we 
recognize we have a role to play to help advance global health, 
and to reduce barriers for underserved populations so that all 
patients have access to high-quality health care. Our focus on 
health equity aligns to our deepest-held Company values. 

In 2022, we invested $38 million in social investments to 
address health equity. Our social investments help advance 
health equity around the world by addressing the barriers that 
many individuals face in seeking and receiving high-quality 
health care. We provide support in several ways, including 
through key initiatives like Merck for Mothers, health equity 
initiatives, and our impact investments. Our Foundation is 
funded entirely by our Company and is our chief source of 
financial support for qualified, eligible nonprofit organizations 
whose programs align with our philanthropic priorities.

In 2021, we set a goal to reach 30 million people with social 
investments for health equity in LMICs and underserved 
populations in the U.S. Through 2022, we exceeded this goal, 
reaching more than 33 million people, including more than 
18 million in 2022 alone. 

To drive continued action, we have increased this health equity 
goal to now reach 50 million people by 2025. We’re now including 
underserved populations in high-income countries beyond the 
U.S. in this goal as our health equity investments evolve to meet 
the needs of underserved populations everywhere.

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023Addressing cancer care disparities 

Our social investments support multiple programs and 
partnerships to advance more equitable cancer treatment. 
In the U.S., we have supported the American Cancer Society’s 
Get Screened Initiative aimed at reducing disparities in cancer 
screening. These disparities have been exacerbated by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Also, through the CEO Roundtable on 
Cancer, we support Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
and Hispanic-Serving Institutions in improving health equity, 
education, and access in communities disproportionately 
affected by cancer. 

In addition, through a nearly $2 million grant from our 
Foundation, we support the American Cancer Society in 
establishing patient navigation programs in resource-limited 
settings in sub-Saharan Africa. The output includes a toolkit 
that can help other countries adopt similar programs. 

Investing for impact 

Another way we advance health equity is through impact 
investments, which deploy financial resources to generate 
improved health care access—all while growing a sustainable 
global health ecosystem and attracting additional capital and 
partners. For example, we invest in Mamotest, a company 
in Latin America providing AI-enabled telediagnosis for 
breast cancer. 

  Learn more about our impact investments on our corporate site,

Employees

Our best-in-class talent share in our purpose to save and 
improve lives. To hire and retain the best people—those who 
will invent and deliver medicines and vaccines that change the 
world—we must be an employer of choice.

Fostering a culture that is inclusive and supportive is 
fundamental to our talent strategy. Our longstanding 
commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is based on 
our belief that unique, passionate perspectives are critical 
to innovation and in turn, provide a competitive advantage 
for our Company. We also foster a positive working 
environment by providing resources designed to improve 
the well-being of our employees and their families. 

In addition to supporting our talent strategy, we recognize that 
our culture plays a fundamental role in fulfilling our Company's 
purpose. In 2023, we introduced sustainability metrics tied 
to our Access to Health and Employees focus areas in our 
Company Scorecard, which include indicators of the overall 
employee experience. 

Goals

•  Increase representation in senior management roles,6 by 2024:

•  Women globally to 40%, up from 31% in 2020

•  Black/African Americans in the U.S. to 10%, up from 3% in 2020

•  Hispanics/Latinos in the U.S. to 10%, up from 5% in 2020

•  Maintain or exceed our current inclusion index score, by 20257

•  Maintain or exceed our current employee engagement index 

score, by 20257

Progress toward our goals

We remain on target with our employee-focused goals, 
including our aim to meet or exceed our inclusion score and 
our employee engagement index score by 2025. We have 
demonstrated progress against our baseline diversity 
measures. We’re delivering on our commitments overall, as 
well as addressing annual fluctuations in senior management 
(vice president/senior vice president) representation to ensure 
we’re well-positioned to meet our multi-year targets.

Along the way, we are building a strong pipeline of talent: 
globally, 52 percent of new hires in 2022 were women and 
in the U.S., 47 percent were members of underrepresented 
groups. We aid our employees’ growth through broad 
leadership development programs as well as through 
affinity-based initiatives that consider our colleagues' 
unique backgrounds.

Attracting and retaining the best talent

One of the primary ways we attract and retain the best talent 
is through training and development. By investing in our 
employees, we also invest in their ability to deliver innovative 
medicines and vaccines for patients. 

Our leadership development programs cut across all levels, 
divisions and geographies of the Company. Some focus 
on business acumen, others on creating positive change. 
For example, our General Management Acceleration Program 
is an application-based, early-talent development initiative that 
grows participants’ business and financial acumen as well as 
their critical thinking abilities.

Our affinity-based development programs for female, LGBTQ+, 
Hispanic/Latino, and Black colleagues build a sense of community 
and aim to increase the number of diverse leaders ready to 
progress in their careers while furthering leadership capabilities 
and business acumen.

Enhancing diversity in Merck’s employee population betters 
our understanding of our customers, promotes the inclusion 
of diverse populations in our clinical trials, and encourages the 
innovation that drives our business. Put simply, diversity and 
inclusion is a business imperative.

Our enterprise-wide Global Diversity & Inclusion (GD&I) 
strategy focuses on the following:

Our People
Strengthen the foundational elements of diversity

Our Culture
Ensure accountability to drive an inclusive culture

Our Business
Continue to leverage diversity and inclusion to ensure 
business value

Our World
Transform the environment, culture and business landscape

Our GD&I strategy also supports the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) to advance gender equality, provide 
fulfilling work and economic growth, reduce inequalities within 
and among countries, and strengthen our global partnerships.

Our enterprise-wide strategy demonstrates our commitment 
to diversity and inclusion as a business priority. It is endorsed 
at the highest levels of the organization, including by the 
CEO and Executive Team. Our Board of Directors also 
has a diversity policy. 

We also have collaborative, cross-functional teams who 
integrate diversity and inclusion (D&I) capabilities into our 
operations, and employees are encouraged to link their annual 
priorities to D&I.

The power of our employees

Our 10 Employee Business Resource Groups (EBRGs) include 
almost 20,000 members. For more than 50 years, we have 
built communities within our Company that foster retention, 
facilitate growth, provide mentorship and strengthen networks. 
They also make direct contributions to our business strategy with 
culturally relevant insights that drive our success and improve our 
decision-making.

Pay equity

We have had a longstanding commitment to fair and equitable 
pay for all employees doing similar work. In 2022, our pay equity 
study achieved nearly worldwide coverage, encompassing 
approximately 90 percent of our global employee population, or 
nearly 60,000 employees. In the U.S., our study showed that we 
have achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for female and 
male employees, and that we have achieved greater than 99 percent 
pay equity for non-white (including Black, Hispanic and Asian 
employees) and white employees.

 Read more about our efforts toward pay equity in GRI 405 on page 134.

Did you know?
In 2021, we created a global digital accessibility policy to ensure equal 
access across our digital landscape, for stakeholders both internally 
and externally. In 2022, we strengthened our support for digital 
accessibility with a five-year roadmap to ensure we have a universal 
design standard for our facilities around the world. These guidelines 
reflect designing for accessibility, usability and inclusion, and go 
beyond the Americans with Disabilities Act.

interns in 2022, with plans to expand the partnership further 
for 2023. We also launched our debut Skills-First apprenticeship 
program with over 30 apprentices in digital marketing, data 
analytics and information technology. 

Valuing the well-being of our employees

As an innovation-based company, the expertise and engagement 
of our employees is critical to our business. We cannot be successful 
unless we prioritize employees' health, well-being and safety. 
We provide benefits covering employees’ physical and mental 
health, including a wide range of programs, resources, and tools 
to help them make healthy choices and live better lives. 

We conduct our Employee Pulse surveys multiple times a year 
to measure colleagues’ perception on inclusion and other critical 
workforce issues.

 See our Well-being Report on our corporate website for more on 
our commitment.

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023Dedicated to a safe and 
healthy workplace

We are focused on providing a safe and healthy workplace. 

All employees, service providers and Company-managed 
contractors must follow our safety standards. In addition, 
we have comprehensive programs focused on reducing risks, 
work-related injuries and illnesses, and other safety incidents. 
Our active Employee Safety Committees are an example of 
how we engage employees in these efforts and partner to 
proactively maintain a safe and healthy working environment.

 For more information on safety, please see GRI 403 on pages 119-129.

We actively support the small and diverse businesses we work 
with. Our Advanced Leadership Program for Diverse Suppliers 
provides development opportunities for business owners 
of diverse backgrounds with a focus on leadership skills and 
business acumen. In 2022, we had 15 diverse suppliers graduate 
from the second cohort of the program.

In addition to ensuring we have diversity among our suppliers, 
we also monitor our large Tier 1 suppliers to make certain 
they, in turn, use diverse suppliers, extending our community 
impact. In 2022, 21 Tier 1 suppliers participated in our Second 
Tier program, generating an impact of over $258 million 
through their inclusion and utilization of diverse suppliers 
for direct purchases on behalf of our Company.

Recognition as a great place to work

We are proud of the many external awards that recognize our 
Company as a great place to work, both for employees generally and 
for specific affinity groups. In 2022, we were recognized as a great 
place to work for LGBTQ+ employees, women, veterans and Latinos, 
among others.

$3.2 billion
in spending with diverse Tier 1 and 2 suppliers globally

Extending our diversity commitment 
to suppliers

We are proud to be a leader in supplier diversity, in both 
their hiring and development.

In 2022, our spend with minority-, women-, veteran-, 
LGBTQ+- and disability-owned business enterprises 
represented 14 percent of our total procurement spend.

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023Focus area:

Environmental Sustainability

Our purpose to save and improve lives is inextricably linked to 
fostering a healthy planet. It’s why our commitment to enabling 
a safe, sustainable and healthy future is embedded within our 
strategic framework. And it’s why we continuously build on our 
long history of environmental stewardship and compliance, 
evolving our efforts in the face of a changing world.

Our environmental strategy 
and commitments

Our environmental sustainability strategy has three focus areas:

•  Driving operational efficiency

•  Designing new products to minimize environmental impact

•  Reducing any impacts in our upstream and downstream 

value chain

Goals

•  Reduce our operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  
(i.e., Scopes 1 & 2) 46% by 2030, from a 2019 baseline8

•  Achieve carbon neutrality across our operations by 2025 

(Scopes 1 & 2 emissions)8

•  Source 100% of our purchased electricity from renewable sources 

by 20259

•  Reduce our value chain (Scope 3) GHG emissions 30% by 2030, 

from a 2019 baseline10

Our approach to climate change

Scientific data supports that climate change is occurring, and 
we are taking action to reduce the economic and public health 
risks associated with a changing climate.

We have adopted a set of climate goals to help position our 
Company to succeed in an increasingly resource-constrained 
world. These goals were developed to align with the latest 
climate science and address the rising expectations of our 
customers, investors, external stakeholders and employees 
regarding the environmental impact of our operations and 
supply chain.

Our Company has also committed to the Science Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi) to set a net-zero target for our greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions across our global operations (Scopes 1, 2, 3). 

Environmental, Health and Safety 
(EHS) governance 

We ensure our ongoing commitment to these areas through 
thoughtful governance. Our Environmental, Health and Safety 
(EHS) Council is a cross-functional body with leadership 
representation from each area of our business. As sponsors to 
our sustainability strategy, policy and business risk mitigation 
controls, the Council monitors performance on our targets, 
while also increasing visibility and transparency internally to 
the business, Executive Team and the Board of Directors.

 For more information, please refer to the Environmental Health 
and Safety Management and Governance document located on 
the Sustainability Resources page on our corporate website.

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023For the third year in a row, we were proud recipients of the 
Peter J. Dunn Award for Green Chemistry and Engineering 
Impact, an award given by the American Chemical Society in 
recognition of outstanding implementation of novel green 
chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry. The team earning 
this 2022 award reduced an 11-step synthesis for a product to 
just two steps, replacing toxic solvents with biorenewable ones.

Did you know?
Since the establishment of the Green Chemistry Challenge Awards 
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the American 
Chemistry Society (ACS) in 1996, we have been recognized with 
nine Green Chemistry Awards for innovative process improvements, 
with six of those consecutively since 2017.

Playbooks for a sustainable environment

Our local sites are crucial to achieving our ambitious environmental 
sustainability goals, and we continue to launch tools to assist them, 
particularly for our climate and waste targets. 

In 2021, we launched our Low Carbon Transition Playbook (LCTP), 
a common platform that includes a gap assessment to help our 
global sites evaluate the maturity of their energy programs and help 
create short- and long-term plans to reduce sites' carbon intensity 
and build toward a low-carbon future. Based on learnings from use, 
LCTP 2.0 was issued in 2022 with a capability to facilitate knowledge 
sharing across sites.

Thanks to the success of the LCTP, we took a similar approach for 
waste diversion. In 2022, we created the Waste Diversion Playbook 
to guide sites on developing a roadmap to our shared 2025 goals, 
including local waste-diversion strategies and environmentally 
responsible procurement practices.

These tools aid in the reporting and tracking of projects that support 
achievements towards meeting our corporate targets.

Realizing the benefits of green chemistry

Meeting our environmental sustainability goals is intrinsically 
linked to the creation of innovative, cost-efficient manufacturing 
processes with low environmental impact. We see transformative 
science/engineering and innovation as critical enablers to 
developing sustainable, low-cost manufacturing processes that 
provide environmental and economic benefits over the life cycle 
of our products.

Our aim is to develop the most efficient and sustainable processes 
at product launch, with the goal of minimizing material use 
and waste from our commercial manufacturing. Our Company 
utilizes an innovative “green-by-design” development strategy 
to progress from an initial early clinical supply route to a fully 
optimized and sustainable commercial manufacturing process.

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023Waste diversion

We continuously evaluate our sites’ waste disposal methods 
to gain a better understanding of our network and changes 
therein, as well as to identify risks and opportunities in 
our value chain. Based on our evaluation, we implemented 
programs resulting in diversion of 60 percent of landfill waste 
from our highest landfill-generating sites.

We are currently meeting our 2025 public waste diversion goal 
with 16 percent of total operational waste being sent to landfill 
or incineration without energy recovery, and we will continue 
to strive to improve our waste minimization, recycling and 
diversion efforts.

Water as a shared resource

Access to clean water is critical for human health. As water is 
a key input to our manufacturing operations, we assess water 
risk throughout our network as a standard business practice. 
Both of our priority water-stress risk sites have conservation 
plans in place and are actively working on water use reduction 
and recycling improvement projects. 

In 2022, we achieved a 17 percent reduction in our water use 
compared to our 2015 baseline. This reduction is consistent 
with our ongoing commitment to achieving our stated 
target: by 2025, we will maintain global water use at or below 
2015 levels. Our sites are employing various technologies 
and techniques aimed at reducing our water footprint and 
improving operational performance.

Our continued endorsement of the UN CEO Water Mandate 
enables continued alignment of our water program with its 
principles directly in our operations. We continued to identify 
partnerships that will help us advance our water stewardship 
priorities in the areas in which we operate.

Ethics & Values

Our stakeholders trust us to do the right thing, and it is 
imperative we uphold that trust. That means operating 
responsibly to enable a safe, sustainable and healthy future 
for people and communities everywhere, and to always put 
patients first. Our strong commitment to ethics and integrity 
is the bedrock of our Company and enables us to fulfill 
our purpose.

Our policies and procedures reinforce that commitment, 
from how we conduct research and development, to 
the management of our supply chain, to available and 
affordable products.

In addition, our workforce is united by four key values that 
represent who we are and how we work together as a Company:

•  Patients first

•  Respect for people

•  Ethics and integrity

•  Innovation and scientific excellence

Goals

•  Foster a “Speak Up” culture by maintaining or exceeding 

our current percentage of employees responding favorably 
to the “Willingness to report” question in the Pulse survey 
as an annual average11,12

•  Maintain 100% compliance to regulatory requirements for 
active incident monitoring, risk/harm analysis and on-time 
notification of data breaches13

Fostering a Speak Up culture

Our Company communicates regularly with employees to 
encourage a speak-up culture and to ensure they understand 
how to report potential concerns.

We invest in Our Code of Conduct—available in 21 languages—
which outlines our ethical expectations for employees and 
for our Company. Our Office of Ethics ensures employees 
understand the Code of Conduct, Our Values and Standards, 
and corporate policies that address our ethics and compliance. 
Our Business Partner Code of Conduct reflects similar and 
consistent principles for our business partners.

The Office of Ethics oversees our global Speak Up program 
and the third-party MSDethics.com tool for reporting ethics 
concerns 24/7. Employees and suppliers can anonymously 
(where permitted by law) raise concerns or ask questions at 
MSDethics.com. The reporting tool is available via phone or 
online, and in employees’ preferred languages.

Merck Impact Report 2022/2023Sustaining trust within our teams

In 2019, we introduced an industry-leading program to build 
trust between employees and management and to promote our 
speak-up culture through the use of listening circles facilitated 
by regional ethics officers. Today, the Ethics and Integrity 
Culture Building Assessment and Listening Program continues 
to empower employees to share their views on the Company's 
speak-up culture. Managers gain perspective on the strengths 
and opportunities for their teams' cultures, and action plans 
help to address what’s learned. 

In 2022, the program was rolled out in two markets, Japan 
and Brazil. It is expanding to additional markets in 2023 as 
we continue to invest in our ethical culture and our people. 

Recognition for our transparency

The Company’s integrity extends to our political giving, where we 
carefully make bipartisan contributions on a case-by-case basis in 
support of policies that enhance innovation and patient access to 
health care. 

For the last six years, the University of Pennsylvania Wharton 
School's Center for Political Accountability at the Zicklin Center 
for Business Ethics and Research has named us a “Trendsetter” 
in their annual CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure 
and Accountability report, demonstrating our commitment 
to transparency around our political giving. 

Our commitment to human rights

Our respect for human rights extends to our suppliers, all 
of whom must follow our Business Partner Code of Conduct. 
We are also committed to the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain 
Initiative (PSCI) Principles. In addition, to manage potential 
risks associated with third-party business relationships, our 
Global Supplier Management Group (GSMG) uses a third-
party risk management committee and program to evaluate 
risks for Labor and Human Rights (LHR) in our supply chain. 
Our sourcing professionals also receive appropriate training 
on evaluating partners for these risks.

We investigate any concerns quickly, and regularly conduct 
due diligence on our suppliers, including audits to verify they 
uphold LHR standards. Where we find issues, they are held 
accountable for addressing them. We also ask suppliers to 
support initiatives like the PSCI Human Rights. 

 All of our contributions can be found on the Transparency Disclosures page 
of our corporate website.

Third-Party Risk Management team

Our approach to sustainable sourcing

We have a sourcing management process in which environmental 
sustainability, social responsibility, and economic inclusion and supplier 
diversity principles are integrated in each stage. Throughout the supplier life 
cycle, our Company establishes expectations, assesses risk, supports supplier 
development and manages performance.

Our Global Supplier Management Group (GSMG) is responsible for driving our 
Sustainable Sourcing program and maintaining the associated standards and 
processes by which suppliers are identified, qualified and managed.

Our Sustainable Sourcing program has the following key elements:

•  Integration into our Global Sourcing & Procurement Strategy and processes

•  A cross-functional team that oversees program development and the 

processes and guidelines to encourage best practices, prevent violations 
of supply chain standards and limit risk

•  Established sustainability requirements that are communicated to our 

suppliers and included in supplier selection

•  Review, tracking and communication of supplier sustainability programs

•  Collaboration as we educate and learn from our supply chain, peer 

companies and best-in-class organizations

To help manage and address potential areas of risk associated with 
third-party business relationships, we have an established Third-Party 
Risk Management program and committee chaired by the senior vice 
president for Global Procurement. The committee establishes, implements 
and monitors environmentally sustainable, socially responsible and ethical 
sourcing practices to ensure that performance is aligned with our purpose. 
In 2022, cross-functional leaders sponsored an enterprise-wide program 
to streamline our third-party due-diligence process, leveraging one IT 
platform to launch assessments, and to review and mitigate risks from 
Compliance, Global Safety and the Environment, Information Technology 
Risk Management & Security, Pharmacovigilance and Global Security.

Supplier selection and setting expectations

We select suppliers that share our commitment to our values and principles. 
We expect appropriate standards of conduct and respect for human rights 
from our suppliers, contractors, vendors and external partners, consistent 
with our own. We use our Business Partner Code of Conduct to communicate 
our expectations for Human Rights, Labor & Employment, Health, Safety 
& Environment, and Ethical Business Practices. Our Business Partner 
Code of Conduct, along with our Supplier Performance Expectations, are 
communicated to existing and potential third parties. They are included in 
requests for information, proposals and quotes, as well as in our purchase 
order terms and conditions. We make our Business Partner Code of Conduct 
available in 26 languages.

Our Business Partner Code of Conduct references the Pharmaceutical Supply 
Chain Initiative (PSCI) Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management 
(the Principles). PSCI is a group of more than 50 pharmaceutical and health 
care companies which promotes sustainable sourcing and better business 
conditions across the industry, and the Principles set the standard for human 
rights, ethics, labor, health and safety, environment and related management 
systems. We are an active member of PSCI. The member companies share 
a vision of better social, health, safety and environmental outcomes in the 
communities where we buy.

Supplier due diligence assessments

Protecting the privacy of personal information

We have a defined risk-management process, and our supply base is 
measured against the process criteria. Using a risk-based approach, 
supplier assessments and audits are conducted based on multiple 
factors (e.g., risk profile, engagement and activity type, geography). 
The assessments and audits evaluate a supplier’s ability to meet both 
industry and our own standards for quality, safety and ethical business 
practices. Results are reviewed with senior management across 
the Company.

Some of our suppliers, such as contract research organizations, market 
research agencies, information technology systems developers, corporate 
card suppliers, and travel and meeting agencies process personal information 
in connection with their performance of services for our Company. We require 
these suppliers to provide appropriate privacy protection for personal 
information that they handle in accordance with our privacy policies and 
applicable privacy laws, regulations and guidelines.

 > See more about our privacy program in GRI 418 on page 156.

Our due diligence includes:

•  Anti-bribery and corruption

•  Conflict minerals

•  Denied-party screening

•  Ethics and compliance

•  Financial solvency

•  Information security and cybersecurity

•  Intellectual property

•  Labor and human rights

•  Privacy (data protection)

•  Supply-chain security

Training

We understand the importance of training, and continue to develop 
numerous training events that are assigned to employees and provided 
to industry peers and suppliers. Most of our internal classes are assigned 
through our centralized learning system. In addition to providing training 
through our internal systems, we also work with PSCI to develop and provide 
training to our suppliers and peers.

 > Additional details regarding our supplier-focused programs can be found in  

GRI 204 on page 77, GRI 308 on page 112 and GRI 414 on page 145.

Where assessments and audits identify deficiencies or opportunities 
for improvement, we monitor suppliers to ensure that our concerns are 
addressed in a responsible and compliant manner. As part of our oversight 
and monitoring, we have established mechanisms to report, track and 
monitor supplier plans to address nonconformance and help drive continued 
improvement. Additional review(s) are performed for external manufacturing 
suppliers and suppliers that manage personal and private information.

Assessing the effectiveness of our program

During 2022, we reviewed the following metrics to help us assess the

The groups below are responsible for directing the day-to-day supervision 
of the Company’s sustainability strategy and driving performance:

Policy and ESG Council (PEC)

The PEC, under the guidance of the Executive Team, serves to ensure the 
Company is advancing its strategic framework through public policy and 
sustainability efforts that proactively shape and respond to the changing 
landscape in which the business operates. This group of cross-functional 
senior leaders recommends positions for decision to the Executive Team 
on critical public policy and sustainability issues, and monitors related 
performance across regions and functions and resources allocated to meet 
goals and objectives.

ESG Strategy Management Team (ESMT)

With guidance from the PEC, the ESMT advises, shapes and drives 
the Company’s long-term sustainability strategy, including providing 
recommendations regarding risks and opportunities to the Company. 
The role of ESMT is to create long-term value, differentiate our Company 
as a leader in sustainability, and answer to stakeholder demands about 
key issues across our four focus areas: Access to Health, Employees, 
Environmental Sustainability, and Ethics & Values. The ESMT works to 
ensure that our sustainability strategy and priorities are aligned with and 
support our corporate strategic framework, in order to meet the Company’s 
public commitments and expectations of our stakeholders.

information on our Board nomination process and the Board's roles and 
responsibilities for the management of and reporting on sustainability 
topics at the Company.

We are committed to governance policies and practices that serve the 
interests of the Company and its shareholders. Our governance structure 
is an integral part of this commitment. Our Executive Team (ET) and senior 
management are responsible for reviewing, refining and implementing our 
Company’s long-term sustainability strategy. Through groups such as the 
Policy and ESG Council, senior leaders from across the Company direct the 
day-to-day supervision of our efforts supporting this strategy. 

Our ET updates the Board on our long-term sustainability strategy and 
performance as part of the Board’s annual strategic planning meeting. 
Discussions and updates also occur at the Board and its Committees on 
specific topics. For example, the Board's Governance Committee, which 
monitors and assists the Board in its oversight of sustainability matters, 
ensures that relevant issues are subject to review by Board committees 
with relevant areas of competency.

Precautionary principle 

We take a precautionary approach when evaluating potential human 
exposures and environmental impacts resulting from our manufacturing 
processes. Conservative assumptions are made when data is limited, 
and safety factors are added to address uncertainty and variability in our 
assessments. This type of approach is particularly relevant to our work in 
toxicology, industrial hygiene, biosafety and environmental protection.

Mechanisms for seeking advice and raising concerns

Our Company’s Office of Ethics is responsible for ensuring that employees 
are aware of and trained on the Code of Conduct and corporate policies 
addressing ethics and compliance.

Our Code of Conduct is available in 21 languages and applies to all employees 
worldwide. Corporate policies are reviewed every three years by business-
content owners and updated as needed. We abide by strict ethical standards 
in our own operations and, to the extent possible, we insist on equivalent 
standards from our suppliers. Our Business Partner Code of Conduct reflects 
similar and consistent principles for our business partners.

The Office of Ethics also serves as a channel for the receipt, triaging and 
redress of ethics- and compliance-related concerns. Depending on the 
concern type, the concerns will be investigated by the Office of Ethics, 
the Office of General Counsel, Global Security or Human Resources. 

Employees are encouraged, prepared and empowered to raise their concerns 
to their management, Human Resources, Legal, Compliance or the Office 
of Ethics.

The Office of Ethics maintains a global Speak Up program and the  
MSDethics.com reporting tool. The reporting tool is operated by an 
independent third party and is available 24/7. MSDethics.com allows 
employees and suppliers to raise concerns or ask questions confidentially 
and anonymously (where permitted by law) in their preferred language via 
phone or online. The Company communicates regularly with employees to 
encourage and foster a Speak Up culture and ensure that they understand 
how they can report potential misconduct or concerns.

In alignment with our priority to protect and enhance our Company’s 
reputation through safe, ethical and compliant behaviors, and to foster a 
strong culture of ethics and compliance, regional ethics officers manage 
a network of site-based volunteer ethics ambassadors outside of the U.S. 
These ethics ambassadors are trained to answer employee questions about 
the Company’s reporting and investigation process and actively support 
the Speak Up program. We maintain a fulsome process for escalation and 
investigation of potential compliance-related concerns. The process is 
designed to ensure that we promptly and discreetly investigate all reports of 
conduct and/or behavior that could violate our policies, values or standards.

If allegations of misconduct are substantiated, appropriate remediation and 
disciplinary actions are taken to ensure that those who were responsible 
are held accountable and recurrence is prevented. Disciplinary actions can 
include, but are not limited to, dismissal from the Company, issuance of 
final written warning letters and/or financial penalties. In addition, we take 
appropriate steps to address any needed improvements in organizational and 
process controls.

Compliance with laws and regulations

Notices of violations, fines and settlements

We report all forms of EHS compliance notices using the term Notices of 
Violation (NOVs), which includes citations, letters of warning and notices of 
noncompliance from environmental- and safety-focused regulatory agencies.

In 2022, we had 196 EHS-related regulatory agency inspections of our facilities 
around the world. We received 3 safety-related and 11 environmental-related 
NOVs, and paid $6,693 in fines in 2022. None of the environmental-related 
NOVs were the result of a significant spill.

Subject to local law, the Company also has the discretion to reduce incentive 
payments made to employees in certain instances of misconduct. This may 
apply when employees engage in misconduct that results in a material policy 
violation. Retaliation against employees who report concerns is a violation of 
corporate policy and is strictly prohibited.

The Office of Ethics and the Office of General Counsel are responsible for 
overseeing investigations into potential ethics and compliance concerns 
to ensure consistent and timely resolution of potential concerns and 
implementation of remediation actions.

 > Please visit our corporate website for more information on our Code of Conduct. 

Ethics & Integrity Culture-Building Assessments & 
Listening Program

As an example of an industry-leading best practice, our Company developed 
the Ethics and Integrity Culture-Building Assessment and Listening Program 
which aims to build and sustain trust between employees and management 
and to promote and enhance our Speak Up culture.

In 2022, we brought the program to two markets: Japan, across all divisions; 
and Brazil, where we focused on an Animal Health manufacturing plant. 
In both markets, our regional ethics officers partnered with local teams to 
facilitate a series of listening sessions with management and employees. 
During the sessions, employees were empowered to share their views on 
the Company's culture with respect to speaking up and listening up. At the 
same time, managers were able to gain valuable insights into the strengths 
and areas of opportunity for their own teams' cultures. After the listening 
sessions were completed, leaders implemented action plans to further 
strengthen their organization's Speak Up culture. 

This program supports the Company’s priority to “Invest in the growth, 
success and well-being" of its people. It also reflects a commitment to two 
of the Company's Ways of Working: “Speak up and be open-minded” and 
“Embrace diversity and inclusion.” The program aligns with our sustainability 
goals by helping to build diverse and inclusive team cultures while enhancing 
employee engagement.

Our Company is a member of numerous U.S.-based industry and

pharmaceutical industry and business community in debates led by 
governments and other stakeholders, and because they help the industry 
reach consensus on policy issues.

When our trade associations actively lobby on our core business issues, we 
seek to align their positions with our own. There are times, however, when we 
may not share the views of our peers or associations—both on issues that are 
central to our business and on those that, while important, are not directly 
material to our purpose. With representatives on the boards and committees 
of industry groups and trade associations, we can voice questions or concerns 
we may have about policy or related activities. We may even recuse ourselves 
from related trade association or industry group activities when appropriate.

The Governance Committee of the Board of Directors has ongoing oversight 
of our membership in trade associations and grassroots lobbying activities. 
Each year, the full Board of Directors receives a report that lists for the 
previous year (a) the U.S. industry and trade groups in which we are a member 
for which our dues are greater than $25,000 and (b) the amount of our dues 
that were spent by these groups on lobbying and political activity in the U.S.

We engage with a diverse group of stakeholders to gain insights that can 
inform our efforts and foster our progress toward solutions that benefit 
society and support our business.

Many of these engagements with partners can be found throughout this 
report. The groups of stakeholders with which we regularly engage include:

Patients and caregivers

For patient communities—which includes individual patients, their 
caregivers and family members, patient advocacy leaders and patient 
organizations—it is critical that we respect and honor their life experiences 
to better understand their health care journeys, expected outcomes and 
decision-making considerations.

Shareholders

Throughout the year, we regularly engage with our shareholders and seek 
to better understand their perspectives. 

We have established a proactive shareholder engagement program, in 
which members of Investor Relations, the Office of the Secretary, Human 
Resources and the ESG Strategy & Engagement Team, as well as other 
subject-matter experts within the Company, engage with our shareholders 
to remain well informed regarding their perspectives on current issues and 
to address any questions or concerns. These teams serve as liaisons between 
shareholders, members of senior management and the Board.

In addition, we conduct an extensive shareholder outreach program twice 
a year focused on governance, executive compensation and sustainability 
matters. We believe it is most productive to discuss these matters well in 
advance of the annual meeting. This enables management and the Board 
to gather information about investor perspectives and make educated 
and deliberate decisions that are balanced and appropriate for our diverse 
shareholder base and in the Company’s best interests.

In 2022, we hosted a virtual investor event with our CEO and other members of 
his Executive Team to discuss our Company’s sustainability priorities and goals, 
and how our sustainability strategy is fundamental to our long-term business 
value and success. A webcast of this event is available on our corporate website.

 > For more information on our engagements with shareholders, including topics 

discussed, please see our 2023 proxy statement (pages 25-26).

families, opportunities to further their professional development and ways 
to get more involved in the communities where they live.

As part of our efforts to maintain a satisfying and productive work 
environment, we routinely survey all employees to learn about their 
perspectives on the business and on how we are responding to the needs 
of our global workforce. The Employee Pulse Survey, our Company’s  
all-employee engagement survey, is our flagship employee feedback 
mechanism and is conducted multiple times a year.

To conduct the assessment, we partnered with Datamaran, an ESG 
materiality and risk-management firm, which uses a data-driven process 
for evaluating the relevance of topics and trends to our business and our 
stakeholders. We began with a list of material issues for our industry, which 
is aligned with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and 
applies SASB's accounting metrics. 

These topics included:

•  Access to health care and medicine

•  Air emissions

•  Business model resilience

•  Climate change risks and management

•  Community relations

We used Datamaran's GRI-certified software platform to scan competitor, 
supplier and customer ESG reports and financial communications, as well 
as news sources and mandatory and voluntary regulations from around the 
world. This assessment was coupled with surveys to leaders at the Company 
as well as investors with whom we engage regularly on sustainability issues.

GRI's management approach disclosures are included in this report for our 
material ESG topics as well as disclosures for many of the topics above that 
are relevant for our industry. We have previously conducted these ESG

Impact investing

Impact investing is one of our core approaches to advancing sustainable 
global health solutions in line with our Company’s overall objectives. Through 
impact investing, we deploy financial resources in ways that may generate 
not only improved access to health care for underserved populations, but also 
financial returns and strategic opportunities—all while growing a sustainable 
global health ecosystem and attracting additional capital and partners.

Impact investing is led by our Office of Social Business Innovation with 
guidance from our Impact Investing Committee. Established in 2019, the 
Impact Investing Committee is a cross-functional team of senior Company 
leaders that reviews and approves new investments in line with established 
policies and guidelines and monitors the financial and social returns of the 
impact portfolio.

We are members of several external networks through which we can 
contribute to and benefit from the growing body of expertise in the impact 
investing ecosystem.

Financial implications and other risks and opportunities 
due to climate change

Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate 
change, may negatively affect our business, results of operations, cash flows 
and prospects. We are exposed to physical risks (such as extreme weather 
conditions or rising sea levels), risks in transitioning to a low-carbon economy 

(such as additional legal or regulatory requirements, changes in technology, 
market risk and reputational risk) and social and human effects (such as 
population dislocations and harm to health and well-being) associated with 
climate change. These risks can be either acute (short-term) or chronic  
(long-term).

The adverse impacts of climate change include increased frequency and 
severity of natural disasters and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, 
tornados, wildfires (exacerbated by drought), flooding and extreme heat. 
Extreme weather and sea-level rise pose physical risks to our facilities as 
well as those of our suppliers. Such risks include losses incurred as a result 
of physical damage to facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business 
interruption caused by such natural disasters and extreme weather events. 
Other potential physical impacts due to climate change include reduced 
access to high-quality water in certain regions and the loss of biodiversity, 
which could impact future product development. These risks could disrupt 
our operations and our supply chain, which may result in increased costs.

New legal or regulatory requirements may be enacted to prevent, mitigate 
or adapt to the implications of a changing climate and its effects on the 
environment. These regulations, which may differ across jurisdictions, 
could result in our Company being subject to new or expanded carbon 
pricing or taxes, increased compliance costs, restrictions on greenhouse 
gas emissions, investment in new technologies, increased carbon disclosure 
and transparency, upgrade of facilities to meet new building codes, and 
the redesign of utility systems which could increase our operating costs, 
including the cost of electricity and energy we use. Our supply chain would 
likely be subject to these same transitional risks and would likely look to 
pass along any increased costs to our Company, all of which may affect our 
ability to procure raw materials or other supplies at the quantities and levels 
required for the operation of our business.

While we understand the potential risks to our Company, there is limited 
data around the potential financial implications of these risks. In 2022, we 
continued performing a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) gap analysis. This included a high-level TCFD-aligned qualitative 
physical and transitional climate risk and opportunity scenario assessment 
to examine which parts of our business are at highest risk due to climate 
change, and the associated costs.

These potential risks are integrated into our business planning, including 
investment in reducing energy usage, water use and greenhouse gas 
emissions (GHG).

We have made it a priority to reduce our demand for energy, and have 
established internal policies and practices focused on reducing energy use 
at our sites and minimizing GHG generation throughout the Company. 
By taking these steps, we are not only minimizing GHG emissions but also 
reducing operating costs and mitigating the business impacts expected to 
be associated with future climate change requirements.

Our Sustainability Capital Fund is used exclusively for environmental 
sustainability projects that bring long-term value to the Company, focusing 
on carbon footprint, water use and solid waste reduction at our sites around 
the world. The fund allocates up to $12 million per year, which allows us 
to adopt low carbon technology, better positions us to respond to climate 
change and supports a more circular economy.1 Since 2015, our sites have 
completed more than 159 projects through the Sustainability Capital Fund, 
which has avoided the production of an estimated 57,100 metric tons of 
carbon emissions per year. 

GRI 201-3 

Defined benefit plan obligations and other retirement plans

Worldwide, we offer core and ancillary financial security and retirement 
benefits that routinely rank among the most valuable and progressive of 
other large multinational corporations.

Outside the U.S., we have more than 80 pension plans (including defined 
benefit, cash balance and defined contribution plans) in over 40 countries. 
These plans often supplement government-sponsored social security 
pension benefits to improve employees’ financial security through added 
retirement income.

Management does not believe that expenditures related to our environmental 
sustainability initiatives should have a material adverse effect on our financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources for any year.

 > For more information, please see GRI 305 on page 101. 

 > Our CDP Climate Change Questionnaire is available on CDP’s website, which CDP has 

aligned to the TCFD reporting recommendations.

In the U.S., we offer a defined benefit pension plan as well as a 401(k) plan 
with matching contributions. The average employee contribution rate of pay 
into the 401(k) plan is approximately 10 percent. Approximately 97 percent 
of U.S.-based employees participate in the 401(k) plan, and 100 percent 
participate in the pension plan. Additionally, U.S.-based employees who are 
at least age 55 and those who have at least 10 years of service after age 40 
are eligible for subsidized medical benefits at retirement.

1 As defined by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, “a circular economy is based on the principles of designing out 
waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems.”

Benefits vary based on region and country, employee group and status, 
collective bargaining agreements and local legal requirements.

Discovery and invention 

For more than a century, we have been inventing medicines and vaccines 
for many of the world’s most challenging diseases. We are committed 
to addressing unmet medical needs through innovative research and 
development (R&D). Our R&D expenses of $13.5 billion in 2022 reflected 
robust clinical development spending as well as increased investment in 
discovery research and early drug development from 2021. 

Global burden of disease

As defined by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) visualization tools 
developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), the 
diseases that our products address rank high on the list of worldwide causes 
of illness, disability, and death. Our research into vaccines and infectious 
diseases seeks to address major burdens of disease that are prevalent 
in all countries. We believe that the resulting vaccines and treatments 
can have the greatest impact in lower-income countries where drug 
donation and immunization programs have been shown to save lives and 
prevent disease and disabilities, reducing the risk of extreme poverty and 
economic instability.

Considering our pipeline, the list of products we currently market, and our 
external collaborations, we estimate that our Company is seeking to address 
83 percent of the top 20 global burdens of disease as defined by the IHME. 
This is higher than the 71 percent reported in 2021 due to the inclusion of 
external malaria and maternal health partnerships, which were not accounted 
for in prior years.

As we pursue our core purpose to use the power of leading-edge science 
to save and improve lives around the world, we also work with key 
stakeholders to help ensure that our science advances health care and 
that our products are accessible and affordable to those in need. We do 
this in several ways, including:

•  Discovering and inventing medicines and vaccines that address vital 

global health needs where we can have the greatest impact, now and in 
the future

•  Making available a reliable, safe global supply of quality medicines and 

vaccines, and investing in solutions to enable timely access to our products 
in a responsible and sustainable manner

•  Developing, testing and implementing innovative solutions that address 

barriers to access and affordability of our medicines and vaccines

•  Through partnerships, investment and innovation, applying our expertise 

and investing our human and financial resources to address systemic 
barriers to access to health and health equity 

Our multi-pronged, enterprise-wide approach to access is guided by our 
Access to Health Guiding Principles, and is responsive to internationally-
recognized standards and priorities. We embed strategies and actions across 
the Company to enable access.

5 These partnerships are deemed 'significant' because they involve an asset or technology with the potential to make an important enhancement to our R&D capabilities. 

Systematic evaluation to inform product access strategies 

Embedded within our development R&D process, we systematically evaluate 
our candidates to identify the potential to address significant public health 
burden and unmet medical needs in underserved health care settings. 
This evaluation process informs our product access strategies, with the 
goal of making our medicines and vaccines available to as many people as 
possible through sustainable solutions.

To facilitate access, we undertake a systematic evaluation at the onset 
of Phase 2 clinical studies to determine a candidate’s potential to address 
unmet medical needs in LMICs. Our approach involves evaluating the level 
of disease burden that exists, the availability of alternative medications, 
and the appropriateness of our pipeline candidates to improve public health. 
For candidates with significant potential in underserved settings, access 
planning may start in the pre-clinical phase. Additionally, understanding 
where health system infrastructure and funding mechanisms are in place 
is an important component of enabling safe and effective usage, which 
ultimately facilitates meaningful patient access. 

Our R&D Governance Committee is accountable for the evaluation process, 
and all recommendations are reviewed by our Policy and ESG Council (PEC), 
an internal cross-divisional forum of senior leaders. When a drug or vaccine 
candidate with the potential to address significant public health burden in 

underserved health care settings is identified, the access planning process 
includes engaging all parts of our enterprise, as well as external stakeholders, 
to identify the optimal solution.

Once approved, we commit to making the product available in all countries 
where clinical trials have been conducted. Products continue to be evaluated 
for their potential to address disease burden throughout their life cycle to 
account for changes in the external environment.

Sometimes the evaluation of a candidate during the R&D process reveals 
barriers to access in low-income countries or underserved settings. In these 
situations, the evaluation process can inform our approach to strengthening 
health systems and improving health equity. We recognize that addressing 
the complex and multi-faceted challenges to accessing health care in 
LMICs requires the collaboration of multiple stakeholders. We actively seek 
partnerships to achieve solutions that enable access. 

One example of our approach to early access planning in the clinical trial 
process is our global access strategy for our investigational antiviral COVID-19 
medicine. This strategy aims to ensure timely and widespread access in the 
context of a pandemic. For details on our work to accelerate broadening the 
reach of this medicine, please visit the Affordability and Sustainable Access 
section on page 69.

Clinical research

Our Global Clinical Development organization is responsible for conducting 
clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our pipeline 
candidates. In accordance with our Public Policy Position Statement 
on Clinical Trial Ethics, all investigational studies in human subjects are 
conducted in a manner consistent with laws, regulations and guidelines for 
the protection of human subjects, including those issued by the International 
Council for Harmonisation: Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP). However, 
individual country regulations and guidelines remain the primary determinant 
of specific requirements for the conduct of medical research.

We are committed to the study of appropriately diverse patient 
populations—including groups that have been previously underrepresented 
in clinical trials: women and children, people of varying ages, sexual 
orientation and gender identities, various socioeconomic backgrounds 
and other characteristics—in our clinical trials. Currently, we conduct our 
trials in more than 60 countries worldwide. In support of this commitment, 
we have implemented a number of programs and processes over the past 
several years.

Internally, we have a team of clinical trial operations experts focused on 
ensuring our clinical trials reflect the broad diversity of the populations we 
serve, and on implementing best practices in the conduct of clinical trials 
globally. This begins with the selection of clinical trial sites in communities 
serving historically underrepresented ethnic groups. We also provide resources 
and training to increase awareness and best practices for improving diversity 
in clinical research. Clinical research studies sponsored by our Company are also 
planned and conducted to incorporate enrollment and other goals focused on 
increasing diversity. 

Externally, our Company continues to be an active contributor and participant 
in various collaborations intended to connect with, support and train more 
U.S.-based clinicians from underrepresented groups. The aim is to help drive 
equitable access to clinical research at the community level. We also co-sponsor 
the Improving Patient Access to Clinical Trials (IMPACT) study at the Lazarex 
Cancer Foundation.

IMPACT is a three-year pilot program that strives to increase the diversity 
of patients enrolled in clinical trials, as well as improve retention and 
equitable access in oncology trials. We have also implemented novel tools

Compliance

Compliance in our research laboratories is focused not only on the conduct 
of clinical trials, but also on helping ensure robust oversight of effective 
policies and procedures, training, auditing and risk management, as well 
as sponsoring risk identification, prioritization and mitigation for our 
Merck Research Laboratories (MRL).

We have a Compliance Committee within MRL, with the objective of ensuring 
ongoing compliance through appropriate management structure, processes 
and training.

The Compliance Committee comprises members of the Research Leadership 
Team (RLT). Including the RLT in the Compliance Committee ensures cross-
functional awareness and ownership of ethics and compliance at the senior-
management level. 

The Compliance Committee promotes ethical science and provides guidance 
to our employees within the research organization on our Company’s 
standards and corporate policies, as well as necessary education related 
to specific requirements applicable to the research community.

Genetic research 

The rapid development of new technologies that interrogate variability 
in human DNA and RNA, combined with powerful computing hardware 
and software, has made it practical to investigate genetic and genomic 
determinants for risk of human disease or predictors of human response 
to drugs. 

We conduct genetic and genomic research within our clinical trials and in 
collaboration with external organizations that have collected human genetic 
and genomic samples and health data. We also conduct genetic and genomic 
analysis of our clinical trial samples, primarily to understand how genetic and 
genomic variation impact patient responses to medicines. This enables us 
to communicate information to regulatory authorities and prescribers that 
will improve the use of our medicines and the understanding of how genetics 
contribute to the underlying disease, which has the potential to identify new 
drug targets. 

We obtain subject consent for use of genetic and genomic samples in 
accordance with ethical principles of human-subjects research, which include 
respect for persons/autonomy, beneficence and justice, consistent with 
the Declaration of Helsinki, U.S. FDA requirements, ICH E6 Good Clinical 
Practices guidelines and the 1997 UNESCO Declaration on the Human 
Genome and Human Rights. When collaborating with external organizations, 
we also ensure they've obtained consent from individuals who have 
contributed DNA, RNA and/or health-related data. 

Use of stem cells 

Together with the scientific community, we believe that research using stem 
cells has the potential to help identify medicines, therapies and vaccines to 
help treat, cure or prevent disease. Many of the most advanced scientific 
technologies in regenerative medicine involve animal or human embryonic 
stem cells. 

For more than a decade, we've applied advances in stem-cell technologies 
to support our research and development. The capacity of stem cells to 
differentiate into specific cell types underscores their versatility and utility, 
from early target validation and identification, to the screening and testing 
of potential new therapeutics, disease-modeling and pre-clinical proof 
of concept. 

We conduct research using stem cells in full accordance with all applicable 
laws and regulations, and our own internal research policies. Our research 
policy involving stem cells adheres to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences 
guidelines as well as those of the International Society for Stem Cell Research. 

Our Regenerative Medicine Oversight Committee, which comprises both 
internal and external experts, oversees Company-sponsored research 
involving stem cells, including highly-targeted research using human 
embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. The committee 
is responsible for ensuring that all projects involving stem cells adhere to 
our policies.

Availability 

Scientific innovation relies on excellent manufacturing and commercialization 
execution to support broad access across the world, enabling our inventions 
to reach all patients in need while reducing our environmental impacts. 

Our supply chain is designed to ensure we operate a lean and efficient 
network that produces our medicines and vaccines to the highest quality, 
safety and environmental standards, in full compliance with regulations and 
current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs), and industry best practices.

Rapidly evolving external landscape 

Our Company is adapting, innovating and planning for a dynamic, evolving 
landscape so we can continue to expand availability of lifesaving medicines 
and vaccines. Some of this evolving landscape includes significant global 
economic pressures, including rising inflation, geopolitical insecurity and 
climate-related disasters.

We continue making investments and driving innovations in our supply chain, 
with a focus on both the short- and long-term horizon. Examples include:

•  Adaptations in manufacturing and supply that support greater complexity 
of oncology and vaccine value chains, driven by new product modalities, 
new delivery mechanisms, and evolving regulatory requirements

•  Planning for increased demand for several new indication approvals in 
oncology, in addition to multiple new medicines launching in multiple 
countries over the short- and long-term

•  Supporting channel expansion for vaccines, including through new 

public tenders

•  Responding to an expanding base of customer decision-makers and 

expanding our distribution models to address increasing shifts in private 
and public channel mix, including government distributors handling a 
greater proportion of our products

Strong supply chain systems, made more robust with innovations for 
efficiency and distribution to under-resourced and remote locations, will 
be the engine that helps us navigate these challenges. These innovations 
are also driving our focus to address key supply chain constraints, while 
delivering on our Company’s goals for environmental sustainability.

Innovations in manufacturing and supply chain

Our Company has made significant inroads in digital capabilities across 
supply chain processes to respond in real time to the evolving health care 
ecosystem. The most notable digital capabilities impacting availability 
include orchestrating the supply chain ecosystem, supply chain planning, 
strengthening logistics capabilities and connecting distribution channels. 

Orchestration: Integrating data and decision-making across the 
supply chain

We are improving the quality and agility of strategic and integrated 
decision-making across a supply chain ecosystem. Our objective is to 
connect manufacturers, transporters, third-party providers, suppliers and 
partners with real-time data. These improvements have shortened sales and 
operations planning cycle time from seven weeks to four weeks, increasing 
our ability to respond to customer opportunities and to meet patient needs.

Supply chain planning

Throughout 2022, we worked to improve real-time supply chain analytics 
and execution, increasing resiliency and adaptability to future supply chain 
disruptions and customer opportunities. In addition, we have established 
automated data governance with centralized resources for master data, 
which has allowed for demand forecast automation and significantly 
improved forecast accuracy. This planning enables us to continue to surpass 
our target of 95 percent of orders shipped on time and in full, with an 
achievement of 98.2 percent in 2022 (see Availability table on page 60).

Logistics

We are building digital capabilities and enhancing business processes to 
create a more agile, efficient and sustainable distribution and logistics 
infrastructure. These enhancements give us visibility into shipments in transit 
through digital logistics, enable interventions to prevent loss of product, 
and ensure reliable product delivery. We also maintain our commitment 
to logistics security, including our track record of 100 percent of logistics 
partners completing security assessments (see Availability table on page 60).

Connected channels

We are using blockchain and advanced technologies to improve the end-
to-end, secured flow of information with trading partners, industry peers, 
regulators, health care professionals and patients. In addition, we’re 
collaborating on the development of an industry technology platform, 
PharmaLedger, to enable e-leaflet capabilities at scale. Our goal is to 
provide patients and health care professionals a streamlined access to the 
latest product information approved by health authorities and to enhance 
safety and adherence to treatment. As we onboard an increasing number of 
markets, we are committed to significantly reducing the number of paper 
inserts while improving regulatory compliance.

Imperatives in manufacturing and supply chain to 
advance access

Innovations across our supply chain digital strategy support our strategic 
intent, focused on the following imperatives:

•  Protect affordability: innovating supply chain designs enabling affordable, 

compliant and reliable access to our innovative medicines

•  Flex operations: plan for supply disruptions with improved risk 

management and business continuity planning, including flexible 
manufacturing, to enable accelerated pharmaceutical formulation and 
process development. Modular and podular laboratory and manufacturing 
allows for rapid reconfiguration to implement new process capabilities for 
innovative drug delivery technologies

•  Adapt to exceed customer expectations: agile supply chains can pivot 
when the unexpected happens, improving strategic and integrated 
decision-making to rapidly react to patient and customer opportunities 
and increase the reach of new medicines

•  Reduce environmental impact: lower our carbon footprint and increase 

the sustainability of our supply chains

Integrating access planning in business strategies

Our enterprise-wide business strategy brings access planning early into our 
product development cycle and balances two objectives:

•  Appropriately ensure people with unmet medical needs have access to our 

innovative, high-quality products

•  Maintain and grow a responsible and sustainable business

For our manufacturing efforts, this means we are balancing internal and 
external licensing opportunities, including assessing new voluntary licensing 
and technology transfer strategies and expanding our network for supply 
chain design.

This business strategy enables enterprise-level strategic segmentation, 
highlighting the specific access gaps in markets and guiding us to 
commercially sustainable solutions, including new archetypes for 
manufacturing and supply execution.

As part of the enterprise-wide strategy, our manufacturing division 
will engage early in the life cycle of a program through a new product 
development and commercialization process to understand and facilitate 
future manufacturing, supply chain and network needs. While not all 
elements will be known, an early concept of the supply and manufacturing 
strategy will be critical to preserve future options. This means we start 
supply chain design early in Phase 1 of development.

COVID-19 antiviral medicine—manufacturing and supply

To accelerate broad global access, our comprehensive supply and access 
approach includes producing millions of courses of our investigational 
antiviral COVID-19 medicine through our global network, which includes 
manufacturing sites in nine countries across three continents.

Going above and beyond—emergency drone 
delivery experiment combines supply chain 
innovation and corporate responsibility 

Currently, more than 20 percent of the world's population cannot 
be reached through health care delivery systems. No one in need 
should be denied access to lifesaving medicines due to lack of 
infrastructure or transportation.

Our Company’s vision to increase access to our medicines and 
vaccines across the globe includes exploring the delivery of our 
products by drones in rural areas. Drone delivery helps us serve 
low-resource settings with limited logistical capabilities. It also 
helps us provide medical supplies during and after acute events 
like natural disasters or pandemics.

We started exploring the use of drone delivery after Hurricane 
Maria isolated many people in Puerto Rico. The use of drones 
can be a safe, compliant and reliable method of delivering cold 
chain-dependent products when patients are isolated. We have 
also developed a proof-of-concept drone delivery with a validated 
thermal protection system for isolated Native American 
communities in rural Alaska and in North Dakota. The proof 
of concept showed we can create access to our patients and 
customers despite logistical challenges.

Vaccines—manufacturing and supply

In the last few years, various countries have introduced new or expanded 
routine vaccination programs creating unprecedented increases in global 
demand for vaccines. To meet this demand, we will continue to increase our 
capacity and our supply capability across our vaccine portfolio.

Our Company plans to invest approximately $20 billion in capital projects 
from 2021-2025, with a portion dedicated to vaccines. We continue to invest 
in manufacturing and end-to-end supply improvements in both capability and 
capacity to help ensure a sustainable, reliable supply of quality and affordable 
vaccines to serve global needs. Our manufacturing division continuously 
works to improve manufacturing processes and reduce operating costs 
by increasing efficiency, minimizing procurement spending and improving 
supply performance.

Maintaining product quality is paramount. To provide high-quality 
vaccines to people who need them, we manage our supply chain through 
policies and procedures designed to keep the distribution system 
secure. We also continue to explore potential strategic partnerships with 
other manufacturers to increase supply and promote greater access in 
local markets.

Vaccines—key accomplishments and milestones

The global reach of our vaccines has increased significantly. Ex-U.S. 
distribution of our vaccines was 78 percent in 2022, up from 34 percent 
in 2013. This represents important progress toward ensuring that these 
vaccines reach people around the world, including in LMICs, who are at  
high risk for certain vaccine-preventable illnesses. For example, we  
have committed over 100 million doses of our HPV vaccine for use in  
Gavi-supported countries from 2021-2025. 

ERVEBO® (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live) is the world’s first FDA-approved, 
WHO-prequalified vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus disease. 
Through our agreement with UNICEF, we have built a 500,000 dose 
ERVEBO® stockpile, and continue delivering licensed doses to maintain 
the stockpile. As of March 2023, the vaccine has been approved in 
ten African countries. 

Additionally, in response to the health and humanitarian crisis of the Sudan 
ebolavirus outbreak in Uganda in 2022, our Company collaborated with IAVI, 
a global nonprofit scientific research organization, to produce and donate 
vials of investigational candidate Sudan ebolavirus vaccine for use in IAVI’s 
Sudan ebolavirus vaccine development program. The vials were produced 
from existing investigational bulk drug substance previously manufactured 
by our Company.

Product registration and prequalification

We seek to ensure global access to our medicines and vaccines by obtaining 
and maintaining up-to-date product registrations around the globe. In order 
to make our products available to the people who need them throughout the 
world, we registered 156 products and devices in 2022. 

The majority of these products were registered in LMICs in the Asia-Pacific, 
Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Americas regions. 
In addition to having our medicines and vaccines approved by regulatory 
authorities, when relevant to enhancing access in LMICs, we also work 
to have certain medicines and vaccines prequalified through the WHO 
prequalification process so that our products may be easily procured by 
and distributed to these LMIC populations. The table on the following page 
summarizes the registration and WHO prequalification status of a select list 
of our vaccines.

WHO prequalification facilitates product procurement by United Nations 
agencies in many LMICs. In the absence of stringent national medicine 
authorities, it serves to certify products meet required quality, safety and 
efficacy standards. WHO’s prequalification program covers routine vaccines 
and medicines for HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis, diarrhoeal 
diseases and select neglected tropical diseases. 

We have made efforts to address the unique needs of LMICs where the 
infrastructure and personnel to deliver immunization services can be severely 
limited. Specifically, we have focused on product improvements such as the 
introduction of vaccine vial monitors (VVMs) for use to assess controlled-
temperature-chain conditions. In May 2022, we obtained WHO approval for 
our Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines’ compatibility for use outside the 
cold chain for up to four days. This helps enhance accessibility for hard-to-
reach populations.

Affordability 

Working to solve affordability challenges to broaden reach of 
our innovative portfolio

Inspired by our former chairman, George W. Merck, who once said “We can 
never rest until a way has been found to bring our finest achievements to 
everyone,” we are working towards a world where everyone, everywhere has 
the option to receive the right medicines or vaccines when they need them. 
We strive to do this in a way that creates sustainable access to innovative 
medicines and vaccines, creating long-term value for patients, health 
systems and our Company. 

We seek to understand the barriers that stand in the way of people receiving 
the right medicines and vaccines when they need them. The underlying 
challenges that constrain patient access range from adequate capacity and 
channels for care delivery to sustainable financing. 

Within a wider ecosystem, different stakeholders—including private, 
governmental, multilateral and nonprofit organizations—have a unique role in 
reducing barriers and expanding sustainable access to health. Our approach 
is predicated on the belief that broadening access to medicines and vaccines 
is best achieved through collaborating with multiple stakeholders to enable 
solutions that solve the needs of people today and for generations to come.

Policy environment 

We recognize that an enabling policy environment is critical to solving access 
and affordability challenges. Therefore, we engage with governments, 
industry associations, trade and economic forums, think tanks and academia 
to advocate for evidence-based policy solutions. 

For example, we are actively involved in the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation’s (APEC) Health Care Financing initiatives. Through this effort, 
we are creating a roadmap that outlines priorities, objectives and targets 
for strengthening health care financing, sharing best practices from APEC 
economies, and strengthening the dialogue across industry, governments 
and academia to diagnose and solve pressing affordability challenges. 

We also participated in dialogue at the Health20 (H20), Business20 (B20) 
side-event, with the Atlantic Council, the World Cancer Congress, and 
alongside the UN General Assembly to promote evidence-based policies that 
can improve investment in health. 

To achieve sustainable access, health care resources must be used in a more 
efficient and equitable way. This transformation can only be achieved by 
learning and progressing together with cross-industry partners. The Global 
Coalition for Value in Healthcare was launched at the World Economic Forum 
in 2019, and aims to accelerate the development of value-based healthcare 
around the world. We are also contributing to the Global Innovation Hub 
Expert Review Committee by acting as advisor to the group. 

By supporting early adopters in value-based health care and spreading the 
learnings, we are working to inspire other health systems around the globe 
to embrace and implement value-oriented health care strategies and models, 
which would contribute to achieving sustainable access. 

Similarly, we work with organizations like ThinkWell to study and promote 
policies for sustainable financing for immunizations and comprehensive 
cancer prevention and care.

Our Company goal to enable more people to access our 
innovative portfolio

Through collaborating with multiple stakeholders to address access to health 
challenges, we believe that more patients would benefit from a broad range 
of innovative medicines and vaccines, including ours. We work in partnership 
to develop and deliver solutions that enable more people to have sustainable 
access to medicines and vaccines. 

In 2021, we set a goal to enable 100 million more people globally to access 
our innovative portfolio—through access strategies, solutions and 
partnerships—by 2025, relative to a 2020 baseline. In 2022, we exceeded  
this goal and enabled access for 189.2 million people (see table below).  
We are committed to continue driving our aspiration and therefore increased 
this goal from 100 million to 350 million more people enabled to access to our 
innovative portfolio by 2025.

We continue expanding the reach of our innovative portfolio through 
developing therapy-specific access strategies, solutions and partnerships. 

Sustainable access strategies, solutions and partnerships 

We operate as an integrated Company across global, regional and market 
teams to address access challenges through multiple initiatives. We have 
established a systematic framework, which is available to all our markets, 
for diagnosing barriers to access, designing and delivering practical solutions 
that can help solve access challenges. We have also established a dedicated 
internal unit to systematically accelerate innovation, continuously evolve the 
relevant capabilities and capture learnings across various countries. Through 
this approach we have been able to accelerate the development of innovation 
in patient access models and solutions to expand the accessible population 
across the globe. 

In collaboration with Financial Times Longitude, we launched the Sustainable 
Access website to advocate for greater collaborations among various 
stakeholders to develop, test and scale solutions that help expand sustainable 
access to innovative treatments and vaccines.

community-based channel partnerships in LMICs. “Innovative portfolio” of products refers to our Company’s on-patent products. Enable more people is defined as implemented and launched in market and will be in 
comparison to the baseline (2020) as of 2025. Evidence for metrics are sourced from the best publicly available data and proxy sources by market. While proxies differ by market, all methodologies are evaluated and represent 
the best estimate of people enabled to access innovative medicines and vaccines. People who were enabled to access innovative medicines and vaccines did not necessarily receive such innovative medicines and vaccines.

2 Includes people reached through the MECTIZAN Donation Program, the Merck Medical Outreach Program, and the U.S. Patient Assistance Program. Total people reached with the MECTIZAN Donation Program increased in 
2022 as partner countries resumed additional MECTIZAN distribution following disruptions due to the pandemic. For more information on the details related to the people reached through donations, please see page 70.

We have been building capabilities to support a portfolio of initiatives aimed 
at advancing sustainable access globally. These include enabling health care 
systems to better serve those in need through customer collaborations, 
health care financing, employer benefit design, and new delivery channels 
in LMICs.

Enabling health care systems to better serve those in need 
through customer collaborations

We recognize that in some environments, the challenge lies in having resilient 
health care systems that can reach patients at the right time with the 
right intervention. That is why we collaborate with health care and service 
providers in the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Brazil and Colombia to 
understand challenges across the care pathway and help advance solutions 
that can strengthen health care systems. 

Leveraging our clinical expertise, particularly in oncology, and our deep 
understanding of the health care ecosystem, we partner with the health 
care systems to better understand cancer patient pathway constraints and 
identify solutions that enable access and the optimal use of resources. 

One such approach is in the United Kingdom. We convened a broad coalition 
of eight National Health Services (NHS) Cancer Alliances and five national 
representative organizations to create the Do It For Yourself Campaign. 
This campaign raises awareness of distinguishing symptoms of lung cancer 
from those of COVID-19, and encourages people living in areas with high 
incidence to seek advice from their doctors if they have concerns about 
such symptoms. 

We also partner with more than 20 NHS Trust and Cancer Alliances to 
leverage data and analytical tools to help them better understand oncology 
treatment capacity constraints and explore opportunities to optimize their 
existing capacity. 

In Colombia, we have been working with multiple health maintenance 
organizations (HMOs) and oncology health care providers (HCPs) to identify 
inefficiencies and pain points in diagnosis pathways in lung and breast cancers 
to reduce the time to diagnosis. 

Enabling multiple sources of financing health care

One of the recurring access challenges in LMICs is the potentially high out-
of-pocket costs for critical illness treatments. Recognizing this issue, we 
have continued collaboration with reinsurers and insurance companies in, 
among others, South Africa, Thailand and Indonesia to develop affordable 
health insurance products for the population, including covering innovative 
cancer therapies. 

We are also actively collaborating with public health authorities to provide 
access to immunotherapy financing through supplemental medical insurance 
in China, providing options for the population and driving greater health 
care inclusion. 

We believe that expanding the reach of insurance products will help solve 
major access hurdles and, in turn, help increase access to innovative cancer 
therapies for patients. This collaborative approach to addressing access 
challenges reinforces our commitment to being part of a wider ecosystem, 
collaborating with others with complementary capabilities to tackle these 
access challenges.

Employers' role in benefit design

New access channels in low-and middle-income countries

In the U.S., employers play an important role in the health care system through 
their employee health plans. In recent years, many organizations have faced 
spiraling costs—especially related to cancer care and treatment. The principles 
of value-based insurance design (V-BID) focuses on structuring health plans 
so that they incentivize high-value interventions and disincentivize low-value 
care. This aims to achieve two outcomes: improve patient outcomes and 
manage costs, which allows funding to be reallocated to support innovative 
new treatments. 

We have evaluated a V-BID Oncology Pilot that pioneered the use of V-BID 
principles in corporate cancer coverage for our employees in the U.S. We are 
leveraging data to better understand our employees’ health risks and our 
cancer care expenditure in order to: 

•  Identify opportunities to move from low-value to high-value care

•  Use data continuously to refine and evolve the plan

We have been sharing the lessons that we have drawn from this pilot with 
various stakeholders and other employers. By sharing our experience, we 
hope that this will help other employers to develop their own innovations to 
improve their employee health care plans and widen access to quality care. 

Many underserved populations around the world rely heavily on the private 
sector for accessing health care. This is exacerbated in LMICs, where supply 
chain and distribution in these markets are often highly fragmented and 
multi-layered. To address these challenges, we are supporting local networks 
and leveraging technology solutions that optimize supply chains in resource 
constrained settings. For example, we are one of the sponsors of the 
Investing in Innovation (i3) initiative, a global network of industry players, 
donors and international organizations that seeks high-potential startups 
who aspire to transform the availability, accessibility, affordability, quality 
and visibility of health products at scale across Africa. 

Another example is our collaboration with a health care provider with a 
presence in 12 African countries. Through this partnership, we seek to 
reimagine the prevention, screening and treatment of cervical cancer 
across Africa. We are committed to working with the health care providers 
on disease awareness and in designing innovative access solutions to our 
medicines and vaccines by increasing affordability for more people.

Partnerships and collaborations to advance vaccination equity 

Inequitable access to vaccines and vaccination services threaten to stall and 
even reverse progress made in combating the spread of vaccine-preventable 
diseases (VPDs). Every year, 1.5 million deaths occur due to VPDs, particularly 
among historically marginalized groups and populations. We are committed to 
expanding access to our vaccines for people and communities around the 
globe. Among the specific actions we have taken with our vaccines are: 

•  Collaborating with Gavi and UNICEF to expand global access to 

our vaccines 

•  Obtaining approval in May 2022 from WHO for our HPV vaccines to 

be used outside the cold chain for up to four days, helping to enhance 
accessibility for hard-to-reach populations 

•  Establishing a research and development collaboration with Hilleman 

Laboratories to bring forward a more thermostable, second-generation 
Zaire Ebolavirus vaccine candidate

•  Developing an investigational vaccine for the prevention of dengue 

fever in collaboration with Instituto Butantan (IB). Under the agreement 
announced in December 2018, we and IB are sharing clinical data and other 
learnings from their respective dengue vaccine development programs

Collaboration with Gavi/UNICEF 

Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) is a public-private partnership that helps 
vaccinate half the world’s children against some of our planet's deadliest 
diseases. According to its Annual Progress Report, since its inception 
in 2000 Gavi has helped to immunize a whole generation—reaching 
one billion children—and prevented more than 16.2 million future deaths. 
Gavi's work has cut child mortality in half in 73 lower-income countries.

Gavi also plays a key role in improving global health security by supporting 
health systems and funding global stockpiles for Ebola, cholera, 
meningococcal and yellow fever vaccines. As a permanent member of Gavi's 
board, and the world's biggest buyer and supplier of vaccines for developing 
countries, UNICEF has a pivotal role in implementing immunization programs 
in Gavi-supported countries and in shaping the Vaccine Alliance's policies. 
UNICEF's Supply Division procures the majority of Gavi-funded vaccines. 

It helps countries analyze and overcome obstacles to improving immunization 
coverage and equity, and works with WHO to support countries applying for 
and implementing health-system-strengthening grants. 

Our commitment to helping protect global health by improving the resilience 
of immunization programs and broadening access to our vaccines around 
the world is fundamental to our mission and highlighted through our long-
term commitment to Gavi and UNICEF. To broaden access to our Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which is indicated to help prevent HPV-related 
cancers and diseases, our Company provides this vaccine to the public sectors 
of countries that are eligible for support from Gavi at an access price that is 
significantly less than the value-based price in other countries.

Through a long-term agreement with UNICEF, we committed to provide over 
100 million doses of our HPV vaccine for use in Gavi-supported countries, 
from 2021-2025. In addition, through our agreement with UNICEF, we have 
built a 500,000 dose ERVEBO® stockpile, and continue delivering licensed 
doses to maintain the stockpile. As of March 2023, the vaccine has been 
approved in ten African countries. 

Finally, for 2021-2025, we committed to extend our current Gavi prices for 
our HPV vaccine to Gavi-graduated countries with a per-capita gross national 
income (GNI) not exceeding $3,200. This greatly assists in expanding and 
sustaining access in countries that have transitioned out of Gavi support. 

We believe that our pricing approach—in conjunction with our commitment 
to partner with stakeholders to strengthen resilience of immunization 
programs—contributes to broader access to our vaccines worldwide.

Expanding the reach of our innovations

We expand reach of our innovations to at-need population and patients—
including those in LMICs—through our access strategies and planning as well 
as programs and partnerships, taking into consideration unmet public health 
need, economic conditions and health care infrastructure.

Our pricing approach 

We have a long history of making our medicines and vaccines accessible 
and affordable through responsible pricing practices and industry-leading 
patient-access programs. 

We are working to bring our medicines and vaccines to more people around 
the world in ways that are as accessible and affordable as possible for the 
patients who need them. 

While each individual situation varies based on factual circumstances and 
market dynamics, generally we consider:

•  Value provided to patients

•  Value provided to health care systems

•  Unmet need

•  Access

•  R&D sustainability

•  Competition

U.S. product pricing 

In 2017, we began disclosing information about the price of our medicines in 
the U.S. Our 2022 U.S. Pricing Transparency Report shows an average annual 
net price increase of 4.3 percent in 2022. The average annual list price across 
our portfolio increased by 4.4 percent in 2022. The Company’s gross U.S. 
sales were reduced by 39.7 percent in 2022 as a result of rebates, discounts 
and returns.

 > For more information on our approach to pricing, please see our U.S. Pricing 

Transparency Report which is available on the Transparency Disclosures page of 
our corporate website.

Voluntary licensing

In the face of the global COVID-19 pandemic, and realizing our opportunity 
to help meet a significant unmet medical need globally, including in under-
resourced settings, we implemented a multi-faceted strategy to facilitate 
timely access to our investigational antiviral COVID-19 medicine through 
our comprehensive supply and access approach that includes:

•  We entered into advance purchase and supply agreements with the 

governments of more than 40 countries, and are currently in discussions 
with additional governments, implementing a tiered-pricing approach 
based on World Bank country income criteria to reflect countries’ relative 
ability to finance their health response to the pandemic

•  We signed voluntary license agreements early on during the clinical 

development process, with multiple established Indian generic 
manufacturers and the Medicines Patent Pool to facilitate the availability 
of generic versions of our medicine to more than 100 low- and middle-
income countries

•  We allocated up to three million courses of therapy to UNICEF for low-

and-middle-income countries as a “bridge strategy” until the voluntary 
licensees were able to supply

This strategy has been successful to minimize the gap between the supply 
to high income counties and the supply to LMICs.

We welcomed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s commitment of 
$120 million to accelerate access to generic versions of our medicine. 
This commitment complements our voluntary license agreements with 
generic manufacturers and highlights the importance of actions from 
multiple stakeholders to effectively increase timely access to medicines 
for patients globally. 

Through our licensing agreements with generics manufacturers and the 
Medicines Patent Pool, more than five million courses of generic therapy have 
been delivered to more than 20 low-and-middle-income countries included in 
the licenses from 2021-2022.

Donating medicines and vaccines when and where it's needed

When market-based solutions are inadequate or unavailable, we pursue 
programs to provide direct access to our medicines and vaccines, including 
product donations and patient assistance programs. In 2022, we reached 
over 359 million people with product donations through the MECTIZAN 
Donation Program, the U.S. Patient Assistance Program, and the Merck 
Medical Outreach Program (MMOP) for disaster relief and humanitarian aid.

The MECTIZAN Donation Program

Our Company has committed to providing as much MECTIZAN as needed for 
as long as needed to treat river blindness through the MECTIZAN Donation 
Program (MDP) globally. The 35-year, global program is the longest-running 
disease-specific drug donation effort of its kind. Our donation commitment 

has expanded over the years to include the treatment of lymphatic filariasis. 
Since the program’s inception, our Company has donated nearly five billion 
MECTIZAN treatments and has made significant impacts on health systems 
in some of the hardest-to reach communities around the world. The MDP is 
one of the most successful public-private health partnerships of its kind.

Disaster relief

We are committed to supporting communities around the world that 
are affected by natural disasters and humanitarian crises. We look to 
local authorities and humanitarian relief agencies to first assess need 
and then respond in a timely, coordinated manner. We provide aid 
through financial and product donations to meet the immediate needs 
of affected communities.

Medical Outreach Program

Medicine Assistance Tool (MAT) 

As a demonstration of our commitment to helping low-income, uninsured 
patients gain access to Merck medicines and adult vaccines, we participate 
in the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Medicine 
Assistance Tool (MAT). MAT is a free search engine designed to help 
patients, loved ones and health care providers access hundreds of public 
and private assistance programs. To date, this tool has helped millions of 
Americans in financial need get free or reduced-cost prescription medicines.

The Merck Medical Outreach Program (MMOP) is the primary means through 
which we donate pharmaceuticals and vaccines for humanitarian assistance in 
the developing world and in support of disaster relief worldwide. The MMOP 
helps expand access to our products, particularly in developing countries, by 
donating pharmaceuticals and vaccines to a limited number of qualified, U.S.-
based NGO partners. The scope and reach of the MMOP varies from year to 
year and is influenced by changing medical needs in developing countries, the 
quantity of our medicines available for donation and the unpredictable nature 
of emergencies or disasters. 

As the war in Ukraine continues, we’re committed to getting life-saving 
support, medicines, vaccines and supplies to those who need them most. 
In 2022, we committed donations of more than $100 million in essential 
products and funds to various organizations, working in tandem with our own 
subsidiary in the region to ensure that refugees and those who remain inside 
the country have access to health care. 

As the COVID-19 pandemic continued through 2022, our Company donated 
100,000 courses of our investigational antiviral COVID-19 medicine to Direct 
Relief, a global humanitarian aid organization, for distribution to refugees, 
including 50,000 courses for people affected by the invasion of Ukraine.

Strengthening health systems and 
addressing inequity

In 2022, we invested $38 million in partnerships, programs and impact 
investments that support health care capacity building and address 
underlying barriers to access to health. These social investments accelerate 
our Company’s purpose of saving and improving lives by advancing global 
health equity, deploying our resources where and when needed, and 
creating long-term value for society and our business. We are improving 
cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment; strengthening the vaccination 
ecosystem; advancing maternal health and strengthening health systems to 
advance equitable health outcomes for all patients. 

We provide this support in several ways, including through philanthropic social 
investments, key initiatives and impact investing. To be most effective, where 

appropriate we align our investments with country and community-led priorities 
and partner with governmental, multilateral and nonprofit organizations. 

We reached more than 18 million people in LMICs and underserved 
populations in the U.S. in 2022 with our social investments, bringing our 
two-year total (2021-2022) to more than 33 million people, beyond our initial 
five-year goal of reaching 30 million people. We are further strengthening 
our longstanding commitment to advancing health equity by setting a more 
ambitious goal to reach 50 million people by 2025. 

In addition to the people we reach through our social investments, we also 
track health care workers trained through the initiatives we support—
extending impact for years to come. In 2022, our partners trained an 
estimated 316,000 health workers. This result includes a significant increase 
in health workers trained through our Merck for Mothers program as we 
continue to scale those efforts.

Philanthropy and health equity

Our philanthropic investments help advance health equity around the world 
by addressing the barriers that many individuals face in seeking and receiving 
high-quality health care. 

Our approach to these investments is guided by these key principles: 

•  Meeting critical global health needs where we can have a 

meaningful impact

•  Promoting health equity by helping to reduce health disparities in 

underserved communities

•  Collaborating with diverse partners across sectors to build healthier, 

stronger communities

culturally-responsive care in underserved communities in the U.S. With a 
$20 million commitment over five years, the Foundation will support the 
development and implementation of innovative, comprehensive cancer care 
programs that can improve patient outcomes and help ensure equitable care 
by addressing access barriers related to social determinants of health.

The Foundation also supports programs that aim to improve the delivery of 
cancer care in low- and middle-income countries. Through a grant of nearly 
$2 million over five years, the Foundation is supporting the American Cancer 
Society to establish patient navigation programs in resource-limited settings 
in sub-Saharan Africa and develop a toolkit to help other countries adopt 
navigation programs as part of delivering comprehensive cancer care.

to improve population health outcomes

Our social investments are guided and approved by internal and external 
expert advisory bodies, including an internal advisory board for our 
Foundation, an internal Impact Investing Council, an internal Economic 
Inclusion, Workforce Development and Health Equity Council and external 
expert advisory committees for the MECTIZAN Donation Program and 
Merck for Mothers.

Established in 1957, our Foundation is funded entirely by our Company 
and is our chief source of financial support for qualified, eligible nonprofit 
organizations whose programs align with our philanthropic priorities. Since 
its inception, our Company and Foundation have supported innovative 
programs and partnerships to improve the health and well-being of people 
around the world. Through these programs, we believe that by working 
closely with others—governments, donors, patient groups, health care 
professionals, nonprofit organizations, academic institutions, multilateral 
agencies and the private sector—we can help build stronger health systems 
that provide better and more equitable care.

Our Foundation has invested in programs that help people living with chronic 
conditions, including cancer, to receive high-quality health care. Over the past 
five years, we have supported efforts to increase timely access to patient-
centered care and reduce disparities in cancer care across the U.S. through 
the Alliance to Advance Patient-Centered Cancer Care. This $15 million 
initiative supports evidence-informed, multi-faceted programs to enhance 
the delivery of equitable cancer care in underserved communities across 
six U.S. cities.

Building on the successes of the Alliance to Advance Patient-Centered 
Cancer Care, the Foundation launched a new U.S.-based initiative in 2022—
the Alliance for Equity in Cancer Care—to address persistent disparities 
across the cancer care continuum and improve the delivery of high-quality,

Community engagement

We also recognize that our success depends in large part on our relationships 
and interactions with local communities, including patients, community 
leaders, nonprofit organizations, local businesses, schools, elected officials 
and local media. The communities where we operate are home not only to our 
customers but also to our workforce and many of our suppliers. It is critical 
to understand the concerns and needs of our communities and address local 
challenges so that we can help build stronger communities and support the 
sustainability of our business.

We contribute to the economy of local communities directly and indirectly 
through employment, training, support of local suppliers, local R&D and 
paying taxes. We also strive to have a positive impact on communities by 
protecting the environment, maintaining safe operations and respecting 
human rights.

Our community engagement programs aim to strengthen communities 
where our employees live and work by helping address critical health and 
social needs. The Solutions for Healthy Communities program—formerly 
known as the Neighbor of Choice program—seeks to catalyze innovation 
in community solutions that facilitate access to quality health care for 
underserved populations. This program invests in NGOs that are addressing 
cross-cutting barriers to heath care access in the global communities where 
we operate. 

Improving maternal health

Maternal health outcomes highlight the strength of a health system. In many 
countries, unacceptable and inequitable maternal health outcomes persist. 
Merck for Mothers is our $650 million global initiative to help create a world 
where no woman has to die while giving life. For a decade and counting, we 
have brought Merck’s scientific and business expertise to help carve a path 
to a better world where maternal health outcomes are more equitable, and 
pregnancy and childbirth are safer. 

Our efforts are focused on bringing fresh thinking and infusing new 
approaches to help end the longstanding challenge of maternal mortality. We 
focus on strengthening health systems to sustain the delivery of high-quality 
maternity care services that benefit women and their communities. With 
our grantees and collaborators, we are improving health systems for women 
today and for the long term by advancing quality standards, catalyzing 
solutions that respond to community needs and harnessing private sector 
innovations for maternal health. 

 > For more information, please visit the Merck for Mothers website.

Addressing cancer disparity

In addition to the philanthropic investments mentioned above, we are 
building a range of partnerships to strengthen cancer prevention, care and 
support systems to help improve health equity in underserved communities. 
In the U.S., we have supported the American Cancer Society’s Get Screened 
campaign, aimed at reducing existing disparities in cancer screening that 
have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Through the CEO Roundtable on Cancer, we support Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) 
in “Going for Gold” to help improve health equity, education, navigation and 
access in communities disproportionately affected by cancer. 

Globally, we collaborate with City Cancer Challenge Foundation to improve 
equitable access to quality cancer care in nine cities around the world by 
strengthening patient navigation, care coordination and data capacity 
through the integration of digital platforms in health systems.

In working with Go Further, we have created a partnership that aims to 
reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in women living with HIV who reside 
in one of 12 African countries, which have some of the highest rates of HIV 
prevalence and cervical cancer incidence in the world.

Impact investing and health equity

Embedding health equity capabilities across our Company

Impact investing is one of our core approaches to advancing sustainable 
global health solutions and health equity in line with our Company’s overall 
objectives. Through impact investing, we deploy financial resources in ways 
that may generate not only improved access to health care for underserved 
populations, but also financial returns and strategic opportunities—all while 
growing a sustainable global health ecosystem and attracting additional 
capital and partners. In addition, to support the sustainability of our work, 
we intend to direct any financial returns from our impact investing into new 
investments to grow our portfolio.

For example, our Company is an investor in Mamotest, a company providing 
AI-enabled telediagnosis for breast cancer and digital solutions for oncology 
patient support for women in Latin America. 

 > For more information, please visit our Impact Investing page on our corporate 

website, as well as GRI 201-1 on page 51.

Our approach to health equity is key to our Sustainability and Global Diversity 
& Inclusion (GD&I) commitments, and is reflected in how business units 
across the enterprise are integrating health equity goals and capabilities in 
their business strategies and performance objectives.

These efforts are guided by an enterprise Health Equity Strategic Framework 
that lays out clear goals, and a roadmap with an implementation plan to 
guide how we integrate health equity across our core business functions 
and practices. In 2022, we launched a $1 million Health Equity Catalyst Fund 
to empower teams at the local and regional levels to create solutions that 
promote more equitable health outcomes and care experiences, particularly 
for populations who are underserved. The Health Equity Catalyst Fund is 
supporting 15 community-level efforts in 13 countries to remove barriers 
to care and/or strengthen health systems to deliver on high-quality and 
accountable care.

We are also investing in strengthening internal data capabilities so that we 
can apply social determinants of health data to support the design and rollout 
of effective solutions and partnerships, as well as track key metrics that help 
us to better understand the impact of our social investments. We support 
our employees so that they have the latest knowledge and data through 
the development of training resources, guidelines, tools and a collaborative 
health equity learning network.

Global Economic Inclusion & Supplier Diversity

Global Economic Inclusion & Supplier Diversity (EI&SD) is integrated into 
our overall Global Diversity & Inclusion (GD&I) strategy, and supports our 
corporate aspiration. Global Economic Inclusion and Supplier Diversity is a 
key priority of the GD&I Business Consortium (for more information, see 
GRI 405 on page 134).

The EI&SD Center of Excellence (CoE) is the epicenter of our Company’s diverse 
and inclusive procurement practices. We create economic opportunities for 
underrepresented communities by procuring products and services from 
minority-, women-, veteran-, LGBTQ+- and disability-owned enterprises. 

Our goals go beyond the amount of money we spend with small and diverse-
owned businesses, as we focus on the growth and development of our suppliers 
to drive economic impact and value delivery to our Company. We are committed 
to supporting the small and diverse businesses that are the economic engine of 
growth around the world through global economic inclusion.

Advanced Leadership Program for 
Diverse Suppliers

High-performing businesses not only build diverse workforces, but also 
effectively leverage talent to fully realize diverse perspectives. Part of 
leveraging diverse talent involves partnering with suppliers that understand 
how to lead and motivate others to achieve common goals, communicate 
strategies effectively and make sound financial decisions. The Advanced 
Leadership Program (ALP) for Diverse Suppliers provides an executive 
development opportunity for diverse business owners to enhance their 
leadership and business acumen to strengthen and grow their business.

Designed in collaboration with Drexel University and Diversity Alliance 
for Science (DA4S), this experiential development program focuses on 
application and is supported by evidenced-based research and practitioner-
industry experience. Participants have an opportunity to engage with Drexel 
University faculty, their peers, and organizational leaders from our Company 
in thought-provoking, facilitated discussions that enhance self-reflection 
and personal development while building relationships across the broader 
community network.

The ALP integrated-program modules support an overarching theme 
of growing and scaling small and/or diverse businesses by building the 
leadership abilities and business acumen of diverse business owners. Led by 
an interdisciplinary faculty and subject-matter-expert team, each module 
provides an experiential and applied approach to executive development. 
In addition, participants complete a Request for Proposal (RFP) Capstone 
Challenge that offers an invaluable experience through the coaching and 
feedback they receive on their presentations and overall performance.

Second Tier Diverse Supplier Program

We have expanded our supplier diversity program through our Second Tier 
Diverse Supplier Program. In addition to monitoring our own purchases 
to ensure we have diverse suppliers providing quality goods and services, 
we also monitor our large Tier 1 suppliers to ensure the inclusion of diverse 
suppliers within their own supply chain as well. 

The overall objective is to encourage the development of sustainable 
opportunities for diverse suppliers to participate in the procurement process. 
The Second Tier Diverse Supplier Program serves as an enhancement to, 
and not as a replacement for, existing efforts aimed at increasing meaningful 
opportunities for diverse suppliers to participate at the Tier 1 level.

In 2022, 21 Tier 1 suppliers participated in our Second Tier Diverse Supplier 
Program, generating an impact of over $258 million through their inclusion 
and utilization of diverse suppliers for direct purchases on behalf of 
our Company.

Global Economic inclusion in South Africa

For more than 10 years, we have pursued economic inclusion and supplier 
diversity efforts outside of the U.S. as well. We believe that global supplier 
diversity can help foster inclusivity, drive innovation, expand market reach, 

reduce risks, comply with regulations and build a positive reputation. One 
example of our efforts outside of the U.S. is in South Africa, where we are 
proud to be creating a more sustainable and resilient supply chain while 
making a positive economic impact.

Despite the right to equality, not all people in South Africa are born into 
equal circumstances. The history of South Africa has resulted in an economic 
and opportunities disparity based on race, and has resulted in many Black 
people in South Africa continuing to experience economic marginalization 
in one of the world's most unequal societies. Broad-Based, Black Economic 
Empowerment (B-BBEE) is a government policy to advance economic 
transformation and enhance the economic participation of Black people in 
the South African economy.

B-BBEE related strategies that we establish help achieve this goal and 
ensure that our South African subsidiary is compliant with the government’s 
B-BBEE regulations while helping to transform South Africa. The B-BBEE 
program is also an important strategic enabler to our Company’s growth 
strategy in the region and key to addressing the significant unmet health 
needs of patients. Our efforts include a $756,000 grant through MSD 
for Mothers to Unjani Clinics. This clinic is a South African-based, low-fee 
primary health care organization that services patients in disadvantaged 
communities who cannot afford private health insurance, so that they can 
access basic services such as maternal health. As part of this grant, we 
supported the ACFS-Feeding Scheme, a nonprofit organization that provides 
meals, school materials, clothing and toiletries to 1,000 children from child-
headed households. These households are led by children largely due to the 
continuing challenges linked with HIV/AIDS. 

Furthermore, to address youth unemployment, which sits at a staggering 
59 percent in South Africa, we are a proud participant in the Youth Employment 
Service (YES) Initiative. This program seeks to connect talented and engaged 
young work seekers to various opportunities, and hosts its own biennial 
graduate development program, which has provided jobs to 30 youth since its 
inception in 2021.

GRI 205 

Management approach

Our Company is built on its reputation for ethics and integrity forged 
with health care professionals (HCPs), patients and other stakeholders. 
Bribery and corruption are illegal, tarnish a company's reputation, and 
undermine public trust. Offering or paying bribes or kickbacks is against 
the laws of the markets where we do business.

We are committed to observing the laws and regulations that govern 
our operations and activities wherever we do business. To that end, we 
maintain policies, procedures and processes that apply to Company activities 
involving transfer of value (TOV), including TOV to HCPs and third-party 
intermediaries that perform agreed-to services on our behalf.

We have a well-established global ethics and compliance program 
that is consistent with the International Federation of Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) Code of Practice requirements, as 
well as with other applicable regional or country industry codes of conduct, 
including those issued by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of 
America (PhRMA) and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries 
and Associations (EFPIA).

Our Board of Directors and senior management, including our chief ethics 
and compliance officer, provide the foundational elements of leadership, 
accountability and structure to oversee the Company’s global ethics and 
compliance program. Our chief ethics and compliance officer reports directly 
to our CEO, and provides regular updates to senior leaders and the Audit 
Committee of the Board of Directors on key indicators of ethical culture and 
compliance and risk trends. This reporting structure supports transparent 
and independent communication of relevant risk information relating to 
ethics and compliance issues.

Our Company’s anti-bribery/anti-corruption program and policies give 
employees (and third parties with whom we engage) the awareness, 
knowledge and resources to operate with integrity and comply with 
applicable laws and regulations, and to understand that we will not tolerate 
any act, or even the appearance, of impropriety.

Our corporate anti-corruption policy prohibits the offer, promise or giving 
of any payment or benefit at any time to an individual or entity for the 
purpose of improperly influencing decisions or actions with respect to our 
business. The policy also prohibits any act that may give the appearance 
of offering anything of value for a business advantage. It applies to direct 
engagements (i.e., those conducted by our Company) as well as to indirect 
engagements (i.e., those managed through a third-party intermediary or 
partner). There are additional divisional policies reinforcing these principles 
in connection with certain activities.

Our Business Partner Code of Conduct presents similar and consistent 
principles for our business partners. It states that business partners shall not 
offer pay, ask for or accept anything of value—or give the appearance that 
they do—in order to improperly influence decisions or actions with respect to 
any Company business or government activities. We expect all our business 
partners to adhere to these principles and operate in full compliance, 
including maintaining processes and procedures to prevent and detect 
corrupt activities.

GRI 205-2 

Communications and training on anti-corruption

Annual ethics and policy certification

An important component of our corporate ethics and compliance program 
is our annual ethics and policy certification. The annual review process 
requires selected employees to certify adherence to the Code of Conduct 
and corporate policies on preventing bribery and corruption, antitrust-law 
compliance, conflict of interest and insider trading. These employees are also 
expected to regulate their outside activities to avoid any conflicts of interest 
and to certify, in writing, whether actual or potential conflicts of interest 
exist. Where potential conflicts are identified, the Office of Ethics will work 
with management to take actions to mitigate the potential conflict.

In addition, U.S.-based (including Puerto Rico) employees must certify 
compliance with our policy on the effects of exclusions, debarments, 
suspensions and health care-related criminal convictions, reporting and 
screening. The annual compliance certification process is supplemented 
by periodic market and regional risk-based discussions and ongoing risk 
data monitoring.

Training is an important part of creating a strong ethics and compliance 
culture. To ensure that all employees understand our ethical expectations 
and principles, we provide an annual ethics and compliance training series 
that includes relevant content to enable employees to perform with integrity 
and to make appropriate value-based decisions in the course of their work.

In 2022, more than 99 percent of our employees completed assigned 
training on anti-bribery and anti-corruption. Supplemental training on anti-
bribery and anti-corruption is provided for employees who engage with non-
U.S. government officials. As our Company is headquartered in the U.S., with 
a global footprint, our employees in the Human Health Division outside of the 
U.S. are made aware of the implication of statutes like the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act.

Employees in the Human Health Division in the U.S. are also required to 
understand, among other things, their responsibilities under the Anti-
Kickback Statute, the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act and applicable 
FDA promotional regulations.

Management approach

Our Company believes that our customers—and society as a whole—benefit 
from fair, free and open markets. While ours is a competitive industry where 
it is important that we compete aggressively, it is equally important that we 
do so fairly, legally and based on the merits of our products and services.

Our interactions with customers, suppliers and competitors are governed by 
antitrust and competition laws, as well as corporate policies. We enforce these 
external and internal standards through our ethics and compliance program.

We recognize that our reputation for integrity, trust, honesty and fair 
dealing continues to be dependent on our ethical practices. Consequently, 
we want to make certain that the ways in which we promote customer 
choice, business relationships and business practices are positive and fair. 
Our professional sales representatives are guided by our policies to recognize 
that competitive advantage is gained through the merits of our products and 
services, never through unethical or illegal business practices.

options based on the most recent scientific information and findings from 
rigorous clinical studies.

Our sales and marketing practices are governed by external laws and 
regulations and industry codes of conduct, our own global Code of 
Conduct, our corporate policies and procedures, and our ethics and 
compliance program.

Our ethics and compliance program addresses and seeks to prevent 
inappropriate practices, and we evaluate our policies and procedures as 
appropriate. Our practices are monitored and compliance is enforced, to 
ensure that our interactions with customers and consumers do not include 
making unsubstantiated competitive claims. Also, a part of the business 
requires the Company to communicate with policymakers and other 
stakeholders to address certain gaps in a market and promote patient 
access. In such interactions, we are careful not to develop tactics aimed at 
preventing or delaying access of generic products into the market, and such 
communications are governed by our marketing communications principles.

Anti-competitive behavior

All new employees receive training and testing, and must be certified on 
relevant policies and our Company’s ethical operating standards. Although 
many of our employees who market and sell our medicines and vaccines 
have advanced scientific or medical degrees and backgrounds, all of our sales 
representatives must complete general sales and product training. Training is 
specific to the country where an employee is based and covers the scope 
of the employee’s responsibilities in ensuring compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations. We stress that if our employees are unsure about the 
appropriateness of the conduct that they ask for help. There are several 
places where employees can turn for assistance. 

•  Divisional Compliance Departments

•  Office of Ethics

•  Privacy Office

•  Office of General Counsel

•  Human Resources Department

•  MSDethics.com

In addition to mandatory training on our Code of Conduct, employees receive 
training on other levels of business practice and compliance according to 
their roles and responsibilities. We evaluate and update the content for all 
marketing and sales training periodically to ensure that it remains relevant 
and current.

While antitrust and competition laws may differ in the countries where our 
Company operates, the fundamental principles remain the same. From a 
broad perspective, antitrust and competition laws are legislated to promote 
competitive markets with the notion that when competitors and sellers 
can compete effectively against each other, customers will be the ultimate 
beneficiary. All employees are educated on the overall principles and, with 
the help of the relevant legal and compliance functions, they are expected to 
carry out their duties in a pro-competitive manner while safeguarding and 
advancing the Company’s interests.

Management approach

By using more efficient and innovative processing methods and technologies, 
we are reducing the amount of energy, water and raw materials we use to 
make our products, thereby minimizing the amount of waste we generate. 
We go to great lengths to ensure that our products are designed and made 
in a safe, effective and environmentally sound manner.

We deliver on this commitment by maintaining a highly trained and 
capable scientific staff, and by actively pursuing manufacturing process 
improvements that minimize environmental impacts. We have set 
environmental sustainability goals with concrete targets and timelines to 
demonstrate this commitment. To ensure that our knowledge stays current 
with that of thought leaders and experts in the industry, we also collaborate 
with external resources and industry groups, such as the American Chemical 
Society (ACS), the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and 
Associations (EFPIA) and Animal Health Europe (AHE).

Products

We conduct extensive testing of our products to identify and understand 
any potential safety, health and environmental hazards. We manage and 
communicate information about hazardous materials to keep our employees, 
contractors, transporters and other partners safe.

We are actively engaged in conversations on product stewardship to 
understand and act on the issues specific to our industry worldwide. 
We share best practices within the industry via our membership in the 
Conference Board Product Stewardship Council, the American Chemistry 
Council’s (ACC) Green Chemistry Initiative, the EFPIA, the International 
Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) and 
the ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable (ACS GCIPR). 
Our objective is to maintain compliance and assure supply of lifesaving 
medicines as we look to further minimize our future environmental footprint.

Our Company also supports the development of science-based, cost-
effective and environmentally sound programs that promote the proper 
disposal of unused medicines and their packaging in accordance with 
regional requirements. 

 > For more information, see our position statement on the responsible disposal of 

medicines, which can be found on our corporate website.

Governance

Our efforts in this area are overseen by our Green & Sustainable Science 
Steering Committee and our Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Council.

Programs and initiatives

Our chemists and engineers are trained in green design principles and are 
provided with tools and resources to help them develop manufacturing 
processes that use safer chemicals and reduced quantities of raw materials. 
We use innovations like nanotechnology to make our products more effective, 
while ensuring that product safety always remains of utmost importance.

Complying with chemical substance and product requirements is a top 
priority for us. We track numerous existing and emerging chemical control 
regulations that require us to register specific types of chemicals with the 
proper authorities. To meet these requirements, our scientists complete 
assessments of the environmental and human health risks of the substances 
with which we work and submit the required regulatory notifications. 
Additionally, we provide details on product use and risk-based control 
measures in accordance with applicable regulations.

Packaging

Our product stewardship program extends to our customers and patients 
through the design of effective, low-impact product packaging. 

These packaging materials serve a range of important purposes; the 
foremost is to protect the purity, efficacy and physical integrity of the 
products that reach our patients.

Packaging also helps ensure our products are used safely, conveniently and 
with adherence. Prescribing and educational information is conveyed at the 
point of purchase and packaging can include child-resistant access, tamper-
evident features and anti-counterfeiting features.

In addition to these critical packaging functions, we recognize the 
environmental impact of our packaging. After it has served its critical 
functions, packaging becomes our patient or caregiver’s waste and therefore 
must be accounted for.

We are actively re-imagining our approach to reducing the environmental 
impact of our packaging. We have developed a long-term roadmap 
to fundamentally change our business processes, including better 
prediction, quantification and verification of impact to drive changes in 
product, packaging and supply chain designs. We intend to integrate this 
roadmap into our ways of working, and ultimately use it to reduce our 
environmental impact. 

A foundational part of our path forward includes evolving how we measure 
and maintain packaging data to enable transparent, data-driven decision 
making. This includes:

•  Reduction of packaging material mass

•  Minimization or elimination of materials of concern 

•  New materials research 

•  Introducing more recycled content into our packaging

•  Increasing the recyclability of our packaging systems 

We continue to use a simplified life cycle analysis tool as a standard business 
practice. All new human health packaging designs are reviewed in the 
development process to understand and minimize environmental impacts as 
much as possible, while still providing adequate protection for our products.

We continue to monitor global trends around packaging and packaging 
materials, and work to incorporate circular economy concepts into the critical 
functions of packaging for pharmaceuticals.

Chemical management

Environmental packaging is managed by the Global Pharmaceutical 
Commercialization and Global Pharmaceutical Operations areas of the 
Company with oversight from our Environmental Health and Safety Council.

A comprehensive and effective chemical management program is critical to 
the safety and protection of our employees, the communities in which we 
operate, and the environment.

In 2022, we responded to the CDP forest questionnaire for timber products, 
specifically for paper and secondary and tertiary packaging. CDP graded 
our disclosure with a C- “Awareness” rating, indicating that we have 
“Knowledge of impacts on, and of, forests issues”. According to CDP, our 
Company is among 57 percent of companies that reached “Awareness” level 
in our Activity Group (Biotech and pharma) for timber. We performed a gap 
assessment of our questionnaire response and developed a roadmap for 
improvements in this area over the next several years. We are in the early 
stages of our program development and are in the process of assessing the 
impact of other forest risk commodities.

Solvent use

Solvents play a key role in the research and manufacturing of our products, 
as well as in equipment cleaning. Because of their significance to our business 
and the life cycle impact they represent, we focus on designing our processes 
to minimize or avoid their use where practical. Where we do use solvents, we 
maximize efficiency and control them in our emissions, effluents and waste.

We have an active Green and Sustainable Science program (see page 28) 
to design our new processes using fewer, less toxic solvents and other 
hazardous materials, and to reuse and recycle more of the solvents we do use.

For cleaning our manufacturing equipment, we use water-based methods 
where they are as effective as solvents. At each of our manufacturing sites, 
we have engineers who are responsible for identifying and driving process 
improvement projects. When it is not practical to reuse regenerated solvents 
in our own production processes, we work with suppliers who recover the 
spent solvents for resale to other industries or safely burn them as a source 
of energy, where feasible. Any used solvents that leave our site as hazardous 
waste are managed at off-site facilities that are on our list of approved waste 
management sites.

We have put in place procedures, systems and processes to manage the 
approval, procurement, inventory, receipt, transfer, storage, use and disposal 
of chemicals at all of our sites. We provide our employees and others with 
information about the identities and potential hazards of the chemicals in our 
operations and final products through proper labeling of chemicals and the 
creation of safety data sheets.

Green and sustainable science

Green and sustainable science is the development and application of 
green chemistry principles and quantitative sustainability metrics and 
goals to the process of scientific inquiry. Our Company employs this 
framework because we recognize that our ability to meet our environmental 
sustainability goals is intrinsically linked to the creation of innovative and 
cost-efficient manufacturing processes with low environmental impact. 
Green and sustainable commercial chemical route development also helps 
to mitigate potential issues in the supply chain of tomorrow by reducing 
our raw material requirements today. Our Company’s objective in this space 
is to be the industry leader for the development of innovative, efficient, 
green and sustainable commercial syntheses of our small molecule active 
pharmaceutical ingredients (API) from sustainable commodity raw materials. 
We are also exploring ways to reduce the environmental impact of biologics 
and vaccine manufacturing.

Strategy

Our integrated strategy involves several stages and aims to provide 
innovative solutions rather than incremental improvements to historical 
practices. We see transformative science/engineering and innovation as 
critical enablers to developing sustainable, low-cost manufacturing processes 
that provide both environmental and economic benefits over the life cycle of

our products. We aim to develop the most efficient and sustainable processes 
at product launch, with the goal of minimizing material use and waste 
from our commercial manufacturing. Our Company utilizes an innovative 
“green-by-design” development strategy to progress from an initial early 
clinical supply route to a fully optimized and sustainable commercial 
manufacturing process.

Programs and initiatives

As part of our Green & Sustainable Science program, we calculate the 
process mass intensity (PMI) of our small molecule human health products. 
PMI represents the number of kilograms of raw materials (including water) 
used to produce one kilogram of an API, and indicates the efficiency by which 
we convert raw materials into final products. We use this metric internally to 
compare different manufacturing methods, identify process improvement 
opportunities and track our progress. 

We have developed a SMART (in-Silico MSD Aspirational Research Tool) 
PMI tool which provides ambitious, molecule-aware PMI targets for our 
API manufacturing processes. We routinely evaluate PMI at every stage to 
drive the development of all our new small molecule processes to achieve 
our aspirational goals for green and sustainable processes. For our large-
molecule processes, we are pioneering new modality-appropriate metrics 
which outperform PMI in their ability to recommend ways of reducing 
the environmental impact of biologics and vaccine manufacturing. We 
are also using streamlined life cycle analysis tools to further evaluate the 
environmental impacts of our processes. 

American Chemical Society's Green 
Chemistry Institute

We are a founding member of the American Chemical Society's (ACS) Green 
Chemistry Institute® (GCI) Pharmaceutical Roundtable, a partnership between 
the ACS GCI and member pharmaceutical companies. The Roundtable drives 
the advancement of education and research on new ways to apply green and 
sustainable science to pharmaceutical discovery and manufacturing. This is 
done through the development of industry-wide sustainability metrics, tools 
and technologies. 

Awards and recognition in green chemistry

Since the establishment of the Green Chemistry Challenge Awards by 
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the American Chemistry 
Society (ACS) in 1996, we have been recognized with nine Green Chemistry 
Awards for innovative process improvements with six of those consecutively 
since 2017. The Green Chemistry Challenge Awards have been sponsored 
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and/or ACS, and we are 
proud to have been recognized. In 2022, we were recognized for developing 
a greener process to manufacture our investigational antiviral COVID-19 
medicine. Lastly, our Company has been honored by ACS as the winner of 
the Peter J. Dunn Award for Green Chemistry & Engineering Impact in the 
Pharmaceutical Industry for the last three years.

Management approach

We recognize the important role we play in identifying, adapting and 
responding to the public health risks associated with climate change, such 
as threats to clean air and water, insufficient food supplies and the spread of 
disease. Our longstanding support of stronger health systems in underserved 
areas is even more important given the evidence that certain disease 
patterns are associated with changing climate conditions.

Energy-demand reduction and the utilization of renewable energy are an 
essential part of our climate mitigation strategy, as it positively impacts our 
efforts to reduce our direct GHG emissions.

Programs and initiatives

We have established internal policies and practices focused on reducing energy 
use at our sites. We will achieve this by optimizing systems and equipment, 
consolidating excess facility space when possible and designing with the 
environment in mind. In addition, we have launched initiatives to understand 
and reduce our supply-chain-related impacts. By taking these steps, we are 
not only minimizing GHG emissions but also reducing our operating costs and 
mitigating the business impacts associated with climate change.

Our manufacturing facilities, warehouses, laboratories, offices and vehicle 
fleet are the primary targets of our energy-demand-reduction programs, as 
they represent the majority of our energy consumption. Our Global Energy 
& Sustainability Center of Excellence (CoE) supports sites by providing them 
with tools, best practices and access to funding for energy saving projects.

Renewable energy

To support our sites’ energy reduction plans, we have created a Low Carbon 
Transition Playbook (LCTP). The LCTP was the result of a cross-functional 
effort at our Company that pulled together experts into a “design-thinking” 
workshop organized to develop strategies to reduce GHG emissions. 
The LCTP includes a gap assessment for sites to evaluate the maturity of 
their energy programs and helps create short- and long-term plans to reduce 
sites’ carbon intensity and build toward a low carbon future. 

We have committed to sourcing 100 percent of our purchased electricity from 
renewable energy by 2025. Photovoltaic (PV) arrays, wind turbines and other 
renewable-energy installations avoid emissions, help reduce energy demand 
peaks and postpone or preclude adding new power plants. We continually 
look for opportunities for new on-site installations, vendor-supplied 
renewable energy through the electrical grid and virtual power purchase 
agreement (VPPA) and power purchase agreement (PPA) projects.

All new laboratories, offices and major renovations are built following cost-
effective and energy-efficient practices, and are designed to meet the 
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, 
or a comparable country standard (e.g. Building Research Establishment 
Environmental Assessment Method [BREEAM], Excellence in Energy 
Efficiency Design [EXEED], Haute Qualité Environnementale [HQE], etc.). 
Offices and laboratories are expected to achieve LEED Gold certification at 
a minimum. 

Construction at our sites over the past few years has resulted in two recent 
laboratories receiving LEED gold ratings, one in the U.S. and one in Europe. 

As of early 2023, our continued efforts at renewable energy procurement 
since 2019 have resulted in a total of 208 MW of VPPA and PPA 
commitments. The regional breakdown of these commitments is as follows: 

•  North America: 118 MW 

•  Europe: 85 MW

•  Asia Pacific: 4.6 MW 

In addition to these commitments, a 7.3 MW solar PV array installation was 
completed at a site in Ireland in 2022. This array is providing 20.6 percent of 
the total site demand. 

Vehicle fleet

Approximately seven percent of our total energy use is associated with our 
vehicle fleet. We have a roadmap to transition to a full battery electric vehicle 
(BEV) fleet. The implementation depends on the availability of like-for-like 
electric vehicles (EV) and the development of public charging infrastructure. 
Our current emphasis includes introducing hybrid vehicles as a bridge in Latin 
America and Asia Pacific/Japan (APJ), deploying EVs in mature European, 
Middle Eastern and African (EMEA) markets, and starting EV pilots in North 
America. Currently, these vehicles account for 18 percent of our fleet in 
EMEA; 59 percent in APJ; and 1 percent in Latin America and North America. 
However, the worldwide vehicle supply shortage has slowed our transition.

Management approach

As we strive to meet the health needs of our patients, we understand that 
we may encounter water risks in the areas in which we operate. Our global 
water strategy aims to achieve sustainable water management within our 
operations and our supply chain, which supports UN SDG 6: Clean Water 
and Sanitation.

To achieve these strategic objectives, we are focusing on the following 
commitments:

•  Ensuring that our wastewater discharges comply with local and national 

standards, as well as internal requirements

•  Understanding and controlling our operational water footprint

•  Managing water risk at our facilities and in our supply chain

•  Reporting publicly on our water use and goals

In our Business Partner Code of Conduct, we request that suppliers 
conserve natural resources and engage in activities aimed at reducing water 
usage. We also ask that they have systems in place to quantify the amount of 
water used.

 > For more information on supplier engagement on water related topics, please see

River watershed. This was done in collaboration with private, community-
based landowners such as affordable housing providers, schools and social 
service institutions, along with the Philadelphia Water Department. 
The project aims to reduce stormwater runoff and improve water quality to 
help make the Delaware River and its tributaries more swimmable, fishable 
and drinkable for millions of residents in the region.

Green stormwater infrastructure presents an attractive and effective water 
quality solution using tangible, on-the-ground, nature-based projects―rain 
gardens, permeable pavements, green roofs, pocket parks, planters and 
other water-slowing, natural solutions―to keep stormwater runoff out of 
sewer systems, rivers and streams while adding safe, beautiful, green spaces 
to communities.

The contribution to TNC will support the design and implementation of 
projects across multiple blocks in the city that will filter stormwater pollution, 
restore urban habitat, create new green spaces, and provide many other 
layered benefits to residents. Our West Point, Pennsylvania facility is located 
within the Delaware River watershed and this project demonstrates our 

commitment to collective action in the catchments where our manufacturing 
sites operate. As a result of COVID-related delays, the project is taking place 
in 2023. 

In 2021, through TNC, we supported a watershed conservation project in 
Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, Brazil with a $100,000 contribution to the Belo 
Horizonte Water fund, led by the Agencia Peixe Vivo. As a result of COVID-
related delays, the project was completed in 2022. This TNC-sponsored 
project promotes governance strengthening of local partners to enable the 
restoration of native forest, implement soil conservation techniques, make 
improvements to dirt roads and conserve existing forests in the Juramento 
River watershed. The Juramento River is a source of potable water for 
the City of Montes Claros, and the water security at our manufacturing 
operations in Montes Claros is directly impacted by this project.

TNC and partners expect that this project will improve water security in the 
city of Montes Claros through:

•  Increasing rainwater infiltration

•  Creating a more stable outflow of water over the course of the year

•  Reducing erosion and sedimentation

Water as a shared resource

Access to clean water is critical for human health and is a key input to our 
manufacturing operations. We assess water risk throughout our network 
as a standard business practice.

Our process is as follows:

1.  The World Resource Institute’s (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool is 
used as an initial step to map water risk. Sites are categorized annually 
using the “Baseline Water Stress” indicator, which is the ratio of total 
annual water withdrawals to total annual renewable supply and accounts 
for upstream consumptive use. Higher stress values indicate more 
competition among water users.

2.  Sites that are identified as high risk are further assessed utilizing 

a catchment-specific approach to confirm that the catchments are 
experiencing high water stress

3.  Sites that are known to experience water risk, regardless of the Aqueduct 

Water Risk Atlas tool assessment, are included as high-risk sites

4.  Water conservation plans are put in place at high-risk sites that use more 
than 100,000m3 of water per year. We work with a third-party water use 
expert to evaluate opportunities for water use reductions at these sites, 
resulting in site-specific water conservation plans.

5.  Sites that do not meet the water use threshold will continue to be 
monitored for operational risk and conservation plans will be put in 
place as needed

Performing this assessment ensures that we can adapt our strategy to 
changing stressors in each catchment. It enables us to better prioritize 
facilities and catchments for water stewardship activities and lays the 
foundation for potential future water targets in priority locations. 

In 2022, the WRI tool identified four of our manufacturing and/or research 
facilities as being in areas with “extremely high” Baseline Water Stress, and 
12 as being in areas with “high” Baseline Water Stress. In 2022, there were 
two more sites in areas of “extremely high” and four more sites in "high" 
risk than in 2021 due to sites coming in and out of the network. As a result 
of the above methodology, we continue to have two sites that have water 
conservation plans in place. 

The sites that use the most water in our network are located in the U.S. 
Of these, two are in areas of “high” Baseline Water Stress according to 
the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool but, through the assessment process 
described above, are considered medium risk.

GRI 303-2 

Water discharge-related impacts

We conduct environmental risk assessments on our products (small molecules, 
biologics and vaccines) from the development phase through product launch, to 
understand and manage product impacts both from manufacturing and patient 
use. We assess products in a manner consistent with the most stringent 
applicable global regulations, including the regulatory review processes of 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. 
Product environmental safety profiles are reassessed during periodic renewals 
of product filings, and risk-mitigation actions are implemented when needed.

We use the information from our risk assessments to establish or update 
our internal, compound-specific EQCs, which are used to confirm that 
wastewater discharged from our facilities does not contain levels of residual 
products that present a risk to human health or the environment. Our 
manufacturing facilities are required to use these EQCs, along with industry-
accepted risk assessment methods, to establish procedures for managing 
and controlling active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in their wastewater.

Each facility uses the internal EQC standards to:

•  Assess the potential risk from its operations using science-based 

and industry-accepted risk assessment methods

•  Minimize environmental impacts from wastewater discharges in 

the local watershed

•  Establish procedures for managing, treating or controlling APIs in 

wastewater prior to discharge where needed

Our facilities have, or will be provided with, API-treatment technology such 
as advanced oxidation where needed, so that our wastewater discharges 
meet both regulatory requirements and these internal standards.

We also provide wastewater discharge criteria to suppliers that manufacture 
pharmaceutical compounds for us and have initiated detailed assessments of 
our suppliers to better understand and address potential impacts.

As a member of the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Alliance and signatory 
to the Industry Roadmap for Progress on Combating AMR, we are working 
to deliver on our commitments to reduce the environmental impacts from 
antibiotic residues in wastewater through implementation of the AMR 
Alliance Common Antibiotic Manufacturing Framework. We have reviewed 
the operations of our human health antibiotic manufacturing facilities and 
third-party human health antibiotic suppliers to assess their wastewater 
treatment controls. We have developed a mechanism for transparently 
demonstrating that our supply chain meets the standards in this framework, 
which was presented in the AMR Industry Alliance Progress Report.

We participate in efforts to address water-discharge-related impacts with 
various organizations, including the European Federation of Pharmaceutical 
Industries and Associations (EFPIA). The EFPIA, Medicines for Europe and 

the Association of the European Self-Medication Industry (AESGP) have 
worked together to develop the Eco-Pharmaco-Stewardship (EPS) initiative. 
The EPS initiative considers the environmental impacts of a medicine 
throughout its entire life cycle, and addresses the roles and responsibilities 
of all parties in managing those impacts. This includes public services, the 
pharmaceutical industry, environmental experts, doctors, pharmacists 
and patients.

In 2022, we used approximately 19.1 million cubic meters of water globally, 
versus 23.0 million cubic meters in 2015, representing a 17 percent reduction 
in water use. Water withdrawal is variable based on manufacturing and 
research activities year to year.

Our water use reduction initiatives include:

•  Consideration of water use in process design

•  Cooling system optimization

Approximately 10 percent of the total water we used in 2022 was supplied 
from surface water sources, and 53 percent was supplied by groundwater 
water sources, with the balance sourced from third-party water supplies. 
Our sites employ a variety of technologies and techniques aimed at reducing 
our water footprint and improving operational performance.

Closed-loop cooling systems, which reduce freshwater use, are employed at 
many of our facilities worldwide. Reverse osmosis (RO) “reject water” is reused 
for non-potable and non-process applications such as cooling tower feed water. 
In all, 1.0 million cubic meters of water was recovered, reused or recycled at our 
facilities in 2022, which is equivalent to five percent of our total water use.

•  Prompt repairs and maintenance of steam distribution systems and traps

•  Recovery and reuse of steam condensate and “reject water”

•  Process water purification system optimization

•  Avoiding the use of water in mechanical seals, such as those in pumps

An innovative project was completed in 2022 to reduce water consumption 
from cooling towers at our Singapore West manufacturing facility. 
The project involved utilizing air conditioning condensate as make-up 
water for cooling towers to reduce third-party water usage. To mitigate 
the potential for corrosion and bacterial growth, a new water chemistry 
control skid was installed to ensure there was no impact to the cooling water 
chemistry. With the completion of this project, the site, which is located in 
a water stressed area, surpassed its water reduction target for 2022 and 
is currently projected to meet the site’s 2025 goal as well. This project was 
recognized internally for its innovation and collaboration.

Significant impacts of activities, products, and services 
on biodiversity

We recognize that protecting biodiversity is important to the planet and our 
Company’s growth. At present, we have not measured the impacts we have 
on biodiversity either directly or indirectly through our products. We do, 
however, have a long history of responsibly managing pharmaceuticals in the 
environment in an effort to prevent and reduce pollution in the areas in which 
we operate, protecting species and ecosystems from harm. Please see policies 
related to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment and Water Stewardship on 
our corporate website.

We are developing a strategy to better understand if the sourcing of certain 
inputs to our products potentially contribute to global deforestation. 
This assessment is in support of our CDP Forest response, which includes 
high-risk deforestation commodities such as timber, palm oil derivatives, 
soy, cattle by-products and rubber. The results of this assessment will be 
incorporated into our responsible sourcing strategy.

Each of our sites in Ireland has developed a biodiversity team to perform 
biodiversity assessments. These sites worked with external biodiversity 
professionals to identify areas that could be improved from a biodiversity 
perspective, with particular emphasis on pollinators such as wild bees and 
butterflies. As a result of our commitment to these actions, we are delighted 
to announce that all five of our Ireland sites are business members to the  
All-Ireland Pollinator Plan (AIPP).

The AIPP is run by the National Biodiversity Data Centre and aims to reverse 
the dramatic downward trend in the number of pollinators in Ireland over 
the past decade by supporting businesses, communities and individuals to 
take small actions to help Ireland's native pollinators. A number of actions 
have taken place at our Ireland sites to support AIPP, which include planting 
pollinator-friendly gardens, installing a bug hotel and bee hives, reducing 
cuttings, and restoring and/or protecting native ecosystems on site.

Animal Health and biodiversity

Our Animal Health business supports environmental sustainability by 
advancing the health of animals. Healthy animals use natural resources more 
productively. The business also supports biodiversity and conservation across 
both aquatic and terrestrial landscapes by:

•  Monitoring numerous aquatic species by utilizing passive integrated 

transponder (PIT) tags

•  Allowing accurate estimations of wild populations, survival rates and 

migration patterns 

•  Tracking invasive species by helping researchers assess how these animals 

distribute throughout the environment and interact with native flora 
and fauna

•  Providing solutions as tools in recovery and conservation of aquatic 
species such as salmon, steelhead/rainbow trout, and freshwater 
fish populations

•  Collecting and providing key information in research of sea turtles, 

salamanders, abalone, penguins and bats

Habitats protected or restored

Since 2016, as part of our UN CEO Water Mandate commitment, we have 
invested annually in habitat restoration and/or reforestation projects that 
improve water quality, restore biodiversity and remove carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere. Working with organizations such as The Nature 
Conservancy and One Tree Planted, we have identified projects near our 
sites in which to invest. By investing in watershed management with these 
collective-action projects, we have also been able to integrate community 
mobilization by facilitating volunteer opportunities for our employees that 
live near our sites and for the communities in which they reside.

Management approach

Scientific data supports that climate change is occurring, and we are taking 
action to help reduce the economic and public health risks associated with a 
changing climate.

We have adopted a set of climate goals to help position our Company to 
succeed in an increasingly resource-constrained world. These goals were 
developed to align with the latest climate science and address the rising 
expectations of our customers, investors, external stakeholders and 
employees regarding the environmental impact of our operations and 
supply chain. 

GHG emissions goals

Goal

Progress

Reduce our operational 
greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions (i.e., Scopes 1 & 
2) 46% by 2030 from a 2019 
baseline.

9% reduction in Scope 1 
& 2 emissions from 2019 
baseline.

In March 2023, in alignment with the Paris Agreement on climate change and 
in accordance with our commitment to operating responsibly, we committed 
to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) to set a net-zero target for 
greenhouse gas emissions across our global operations (Scopes 1, 2 and 3). 

We have committed to becoming carbon neutral across our operations 
(Scopes 1 & 2 GHG emissions) by 2025, to reduce our Scopes 1 & 2 GHG 
emissions 46 percent by 2030 from a 2019 baseline (including biogenic 
emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks), and to reduce our 
value chain (Scope 3 GHG emissions) 30 percent by 2030, also from a 2019 
baseline. These reduction targets have been verified by the SBTi. 

We seek to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations with ongoing 
innovation to increase energy efficiency, applying sustainable building 
standards and continuing to transition away from fossil fuel use. 
Remaining Scope 1 emissions will be balanced each year by investing in  
high-quality carbon offsets, including carbon removal offsets.

We continue to find ways to decrease energy demand and have increased 
the amount of renewable energy we purchase. Our procurement team is 
engaging our strategic suppliers in our efforts to reduce the environmental 
impacts within our supply chain. In our Business Partner Code of Conduct, 
we request that suppliers conserve energy and engage in activities aimed at 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Governance

We ensure our ongoing commitment to these areas through thoughtful 
governance. The Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Council, 
which comprises top-level executives from throughout the Company, 
provides enterprise leadership and sponsorship for our environmental 
sustainability strategy. The EHS Council monitors progress towards our 
public targets, influences decisions for environmental sustainability strategy 
implementation, and also increases visibility and transparency internally 
to the business, Executive Team and the Board of Directors. Our internal 
Environmental Sustainability Implementation Steering Committee also 
comprises top-level executives from throughout the Company, oversees 
progress of initiatives at the enterprise level, and provides support and 
guidance on the implementation plans and resourcing of our environmental 
sustainability strategy globally. This steering committee is informed by 
leaders from the Environmental Sustainability Center of Excellence (CoE), 
Global Energy & Sustainability CoE and Energy Procurement CoE, who 
develop our goals in alignment with stakeholder expectations, track their 
progress, and develop and provide continuous improvement on plans to 
achieve and sustain our public commitments.

Each site is responsible for the management of its energy use. In many 
cases, we also partner with our third-party Integrated Facility Management 
(IFM) providers to manage energy use and work toward achieving the 
corporate goals.

In 2022, we conducted a climate policy alignment assessment of the trade 
associations referenced in GRI 2-23 on page 42 by determining whether 
they had publicly disclosed formal positions on climate change and, if so, 
reviewing those positions in the context of our Company’s own position on 
climate change. 

 > This assessment can be found on the Sustainability Resources page on our 

corporate website.

Our Company is performing a high-level qualitative physical and transitional 
climate risk and opportunity scenario assessment aligned with the framework 
created by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

factor updates [EPA Climate Leaders (2022)]. The World Resource Institute’s Greenhouse Gas Protocol defines Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as direct emissions from owned or controlled sources such as on-site 
fuel combustion and fleet vehicles. Scope 2 GHG emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy consumed by the reporting company. Scope 3 GHG emissions include all other indirect emissions in a

Reduction of GHG emissions

From 2021 to 2022, our combined year-over-year Scope 1 and market-based 
Scope 2 GHG emissions remained about the same. While we implemented 
several projects that reduced our GHG emissions, we also experienced capital 
expansion, which resulted in no net reduction in GHG emissions from the 
last year.

We have analyzed and reported our Scope 3 impacts using primary activity 
data and accepted emission factors in addition to an economic input-output 
model based on our third-party spend. In 2022, our Scope 3 GHG emissions 
decreased as compared to 2021. While performance was mixed across our 
reported categories, a decrease in our largest category, Purchased Goods and 
Services, led to an overall decrease from 2021.

Our analysis shows that our Scope 3 GHG emissions impacts are nearly seven 
times greater than our combined Scopes 1 & 2 emissions. We are working 
to reduce those impacts through activities such as reducing waste in our 
operations, creating more sustainable packaging, and changing the way we 
commute to work and travel for business. We are also engaging with our 
strategic suppliers to identify ways to reduce GHG emissions in our supply 
chain. These actions not only reduce our environmental impact, but also 
benefit the business by reducing costs.

We report our GHG emissions as required by regulations in certain countries 
and annually through CDP Climate. In 2022, CDP graded our disclosure as a 
“B” or a rating of “management,” indicating that we are “taking coordinated 
action on climate issues.”

NOx, SOx and other emissions

We are committed to controlling air emissions from our facilities to reduce 
local, regional and global environmental impacts. Air emissions are generated 
by our manufacturing and research operations, as well as by burning fuel in 
on-site equipment and fleet vehicles. Our Air Management Standard requires 
our facilities to quantify and control air emissions to comply with both 
applicable regulations and emission standards. Where regulations do not 
mandate emission quantification, our facilities are required to use guidelines 
and tools associated with Air Management Standard to estimate emissions. 
These guidelines and tools were developed using U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) emission calculation methodologies.

Any increase in production can negatively impact our emissions trends. 
While there are efforts to minimize solvent use in production, solvents 
are needed for cleaning and disinfecting purposes. As we transform from 
manufacturing of pharmaceuticals to biopharmaceuticals, mandatory 
cleaning and disinfection protocols associated with biologics and vaccines are 
increasing solvent-based emissions. The Montreal Protocol mandates phase-
out of refrigerants that are ozone-depleting substances (ODS) per schedules 
approved for individual countries. Our facilities strive to maintain compliance 
with applicable regulatory requirements that have been established in 
accordance with each country’s commitments.

Our Air Center of Excellence (CoE) provides assistance as needed to our 
facilities to obtain appropriate environmental permits, and to quantify 
and control air emissions to comply with applicable regulations and 
emission standards.

Production and research emissions

Many of our pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, cleaning/disinfection 
operations and research laboratories require the use of solvents. Evaporation 
of solvents into the air is our primary source of volatile organic compound 
(VOC) emissions. In an effort to reduce VOCs, reductions in solvent 
usage has been incorporated as an element of our Green & Sustainable 
Science program. 

Key elements of the program include designing efficient processes that use 
fewer and less-hazardous organic solvents, and using water-based methods 
for cleaning our process equipment where they are equally effective as 
solvent-based methods. To reduce emissions from processes where organic 
solvents are used, we use pollution-control technologies such as conservation 
vents, carbon filters, thermal oxidizers, condensers and scrubbers.

 > For more information on this program, please see GRI 301 on page 84.

Fossil fuel combustion emissions

Air emissions are also generated by burning fuel in our boilers and power-
generation turbines (for heat and energy), and by other combustion 
processes such as thermal oxidizers (for treating air emissions) and 
incinerators (for destroying waste). Our fleet vehicles and aircraft also 

burn fuel and generate air emissions. These combustion processes result in 
emissions of carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx) 
and VOCs.

We strive to make our facilities more energy efficient through our energy-
management programs and to improve the fuel efficiency of our fleet 
vehicles. Our company’s actions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to 
meet our public climate commitments will also result in a reduction of NOx, 
SOx and VOC emissions. 

The increase in NOx and SOx emissions from 2021 to 2022 is a result of 
the combination of multiple factors, including an increase in the use of jets 
compared to pre-pandemic levels, an increase in the combustion of diesel fuel 
at a couple of our facilities (addressing a power failure due to a hurricane and 
a natural gas curtailment during winter), more accurate emission-tracking 
methods and variations in energy needs at multiple facilities. 

VOC emissions decreased from 2021 to 2022 due to variations in production, 
replacement of solvent-based cleaning with water-based cleaning at one 
of our facilities, and data collection improvements with the adoption of 
more accurate emission tracking methods. Emissions of ozone-depleting 
substances are the result of non-routine releases from temperature control 
and fire suppression systems and can vary from year to year.

Management approach

The proper management of waste from our facilities is important to the 
communities in which we operate and is a focus of our environmental permits 
and other regulatory requirements.

Our waste management standard requires our facilities to comply with 
applicable generation, management and disposal regulations and standards. 
To minimize our environmental footprint and align with the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals, we look for opportunities to avoid the use of hazardous 
materials, to reuse or recycle materials and to prevent the generation of 
waste. When prevention, reuse and recycling are not practical or feasible, we 
apply controls and treatment technologies to prevent human health impacts 
and minimize environmental impacts.

Governance

Waste management is overseen globally by our Waste and Dangerous Goods 
Center of Excellence (CoE). Each site is responsible for the management of 
its waste. In many cases, we partner with our third-party Integrated Facility 
Management (IFM) partners to manage site waste and work toward realizing 
the waste goals.

Waste generation and significant waste-related impacts

GRI 306-2 

Management of significant waste-related impacts

Operational waste

The amount of waste we generate reflects the efficiency of our 
manufacturing processes.

Operational waste is primarily generated from the following activities:

•  Manufacturing

•  Packaging

•  On-site wastewater treatment

•  Research

Waste minimization begins with the evaluation of our product designs and 
manufacturing processes. Through our Green & Sustainable Science program 
(see GRI 301 on page 84), we design processes that use safer chemicals, 
consume less energy, use less water and other resources, and generate less 
waste. Our process development biologists, chemists and engineers have the 
expertise to create more sustainable ways to make our products.

We continuously strive to reduce the amount of operational waste we 
generate and to maximize the use of environmentally beneficial disposal 
methods such as recycling, composting and waste-to-energy. To ensure our 
waste is managed in an environmentally responsible manner, we use only 
approved waste disposal facilities. Approved facilities demonstrate that they 
have the systems, technologies and practices to manage our waste streams 
responsibly and in compliance with all applicable requirements. We routinely 
audit these facilities to verify the acceptability of their systems and practices. 

Waste types are defined differently in various parts of the world. For this 
report, we have divided our operational waste into two categories: 

•  Hazardous waste: Highly regulated or high-risk waste streams that need 

to be neutralized, treated or destroyed to address a particular hazard such 
as toxicity, flammability, corrosivity, radioactivity, pharmaceutically active 
or infectious

•  Non-hazardous waste: Includes all other operational waste

The amount of construction-project-related waste can vary significantly 
from year to year based on the number and size of projects. Therefore, our 
definition of operational waste does not include construction or demolition 
waste from construction projects.

Over the past few years, a number of countries in Asia have enacted 
legislation restricting the acceptance of solid waste from other countries. 
Historically, a large percentage of recyclable waste collected in the U.S. has 
been shipped to Asia for recycling, so this change had and continues to have 
the potential to affect the percentage of our non-hazardous waste sent for 
recycling. However, this change had minimal impact on our recycling rates

in the past year. The amount of our non-hazardous waste sent for recycling 
decreased by three percentage points from 2021 to 2022. 

In 2022, two of the Company's largest sites sending non-hazardous waste 
to landfills implemented diversion strategies to reduce the volume of 
waste going to landfill by 60 percent. We also allocated approximately 
$142,000 to additional waste projects through the Sustainability Capital 
Fund. The majority of this funding supported the installation at one facility 
of a biodigester that uses bacteria to break down organic waste matter. 
The remainder was used to support water diversion awareness with  
AI-sorting technology.

Value chain waste

Potential waste-related impacts are also associated with upstream activities 
such as external manufacturing of active ingredients, the purchase of raw 
materials and goods, and the return of off-spec product. Similarly, the 
impacts downstream of the packaging and waste generated from the use 
of our products is estimated in our Scope 3 GHG emissions.

 > For more information on our GHG emissions, please refer to section GRI 305 on page 101.

While we may not be in full control of the waste generated in our value chain, 
we pursue various initiatives to reduce the impact through our product and 
material choices. Some of these waste reduction initiatives across our value 
chain include:

•  Eliminating substances of concern from packaging

•  Solvent recovery and beneficial reuse

•  Packaging design efficiency

•  Re-usable shippers (in product distribution)

According to our Business Partner Code of Conduct, partners shall operate 
in an environmentally responsible and efficient manner to minimize adverse 
impacts on the environment. Partners are encouraged to conserve natural 
resources, to avoid the use of hazardous materials where possible and to 
engage in activities that reuse and recycle.

Approximately 14 percent of our hazardous waste was sent offsite for 
recycling and was either returned to us for reuse or sold to other industries. 
This is a decrease from the 19 percent that was recycled Company-wide in 
2021, and is attributed to reduced production at one of our manufacturing 
facilities that is in the process of being closed. Another 60 percent was 

burned to generate power, up from 28 percent in 2021. About 19 percent 
of the total hazardous waste generated was incinerated without energy 
recovery, down from 44 percent in 2021 due to a reclassification based on 
new information as explained in footnote 2 on the previous page. Less than 
one percent was sent to hazardous-waste landfills.

In 2022, 16 percent of our non-hazardous waste was composted, a decrease 
from 19 percent in the previous year. Approximately 39 percent of our non-
hazardous waste was sent offsite for recycling, a decrease from 42 percent in 
2021. Another 29 percent was burned to generate power, up from 22 percent 
in 2021. A contributor to this increase included one of the Company's largest 
sites generating non-hazardous waste to landfill transitioning a portion 
of its waste from landfill to energy recovery. About 3 percent of the total 
non-hazardous waste generated was incinerated without energy recovery 
(unchanged from 2021), and 10 percent was sent to non-hazardous waste 
landfills, down from 12 percent in 2021.

In 2022, we managed 83,333 metric tons of waste from our operations, 
a two percent increase from 2021. Of this total, 48,540 metric tons were 
hazardous waste. 

Of the hazardous waste we generated in 2022, 75 percent was beneficially 
reused (reused, recycled, composted or sent for energy recovery), up from 
50 percent in 2021 (see footnote 2 of the table above for explanation of 
these changes).

We beneficially reused 87 percent of the 34,793 metric tons of nonhazardous 
waste we generated in 2022. We are evaluating and refining the programs 
currently in place at our manufacturing, research and office sites to reduce 
waste generation and increase recycling.

Approximately 49 percent of our facilities sent zero operational waste to 
landfill in 2022, down from 52 percent in 2021. The decrease was due to 
additional sites coming into the network. Year over year, there was no net 
change in the number of sites that sent zero operational waste to landfill. 

The overall percentage of waste sent to landfill decreased from five percent 
in 2021 to four percent in 2022. We continue to work to identify alternate 
methods of waste management that will reduce the amount of waste sent to 
incinerators (without energy recovery) and landfills.

We do not collect data on the amount of product accepted for takeback, 
reuse or disposal.

Management approach

Environmental sustainability principles are integrated into each stage of 
our supplier management program. Our Global Supplier Management 
Group (GSMG) drives the program and maintains the associated standards 
and processes by which suppliers are identified, qualified and managed. 
The environmental sustainability program is an essential element of supplier 
management along with social responsibility, economic inclusion and supplier 
diversity (EI&SD).

 > Please visit GRI 2-6 on page 35, GRI 204 on page 77 and GRI 414 on page 145 for 
additional information regarding our integrated approach with our suppliers.

External Manufacturing

External manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished 
products are screened for environmental health and safety (EHS) compliance, 
in addition to quality, supply and technical competence requirements. 
The EHS screening and on-site assessment is led by GSMG and Global Safety 
and the Environment (GSE), and includes a survey covering such topics as 
regulatory compliance, fatalities and major incidents.

Based on the screening results and activities undertaken by the supplier, 
certain external manufacturers are subject to a more detailed on-site 
assessment conducted by a multidisciplinary team, which may include 
our Quality, GSE, Global Technical Operations and GSMG representatives. 
The external manufacturers with whom we contract are periodically 
reassessed using a risk-based approach; higher-risk external manufacturers 
are subject to more frequent on-site assessments. We expect that 
observations made during the EHS assessment process will be remediated 
by our external manufacturers, and we monitor and track corrective and 
preventative actions (CAPAs) through completion.

Since 2020, the EHS assessment schedule has been negatively impacted by 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in Q2 2022, EHS assessments have been 
primarily completed in person. However, some assessments were completely

Going forward

While introductory goals were established in 2017, our Company continues 
to work to improve how we partner with our third parties to drive improved 
environmental sustainability throughout our supply chain. 

We are initiating collaborations with our value-chain partners to: 

•  Gather their Company-apportioned activity-based/actual emissions data

•  Forecast future performance of emission reduction plans

•  Realize actual emission reductions for planned projects

We have created an enterprise-wide decarbonization roadmap focusing 
on third parties supplying goods and services such as logistics, packaging, 
information technology, active pharmaceutical ingredients and site services.

Hiring, retaining and developing strong leadership is one of our Company’s 
top goals. We know that diverse teams thrive and contribute to our 
Company’s overall success. In 2022, 52 percent of all hires globally were 
female while in the U.S., 47 percent were from underrepresented ethnic 
groups. We provide our managers and external recruiting organizations 
with the tools they need in order to succeed in mitigating unconscious 
biases throughout the hiring process. We employ a targeted communication 
strategy with marketing, social media and alliances that reach broad and 
diverse pools of talent.

Despite lingering pandemic fears, 2022 continued to show significant hiring 
growth in many of our regions including the U.S., our largest-volume hiring 
market. We also saw hiring growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. This global 
growth is largely due to investments in sales, clinical trials, IT, and digital 
and analytics.

As a result of the global pandemic, China’s 2022 hire rate decreased due to 
lockdowns and restrictions in the country. Our hiring strategy in the region 
continues to focus on securing digital, analytical and automation skill sets 
across all divisions, especially in Oncology and Vaccines in Global Human 
Health and in our R&D division.

Notably, we increased our efforts around creating a diverse workforce 
through our sourcing, branding and selection processes. We successfully 
collaborated with a number of external partners to attract diverse candidates 
across many different demographics. 

Our Company has continued to invest in and partner with several diversity 
hiring programs in the U.S.

Our aim for 2023 is to increase our hiring commitments across programs. 
We will continue to promote early talent initiatives. Overall, we achieved 
success in identifying, sourcing and attracting critical talent in a post-
pandemic environment.

Management approach

As a global health care company, we strive to provide a safe and healthy 
workplace. We seek to reduce environmental, health and safety (EHS) risks 
in order to eliminate work-related injuries, illnesses and unplanned events 
from all aspects of our operations through a comprehensive EHS program. 
We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace that complies 
with all applicable safety laws and regulations. In addition, we aim for EHS 
performance that is among the best in the pharmaceutical industry. 

All employees, service providers and Company-managed contractors must 
follow the standards and requirements in our EHS management system. 
Compliance with these requirements is measured through site-audit 
processes and through peer reviews for construction.

Each year, we set targets and track leading and lagging safety metrics. 
These metrics include safety observations, near-miss incidents, peer safety 
reviews, Recordable Injury Rates (RIR), Lost Time Injury Rates (LTIR) and 
Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (DART) rates. 

For consistency across the Company, and to enable us to compare our injury 
rates with those of other multinational companies, we use the U.S.-based 
OSHA recordkeeping criteria for recording and tracking work-related injuries 
and illnesses. We require all injuries, illnesses and incidents involving our 
employees to be reported and investigated to determine their cause. We also 
require corrective and preventative actions be taken to prevent recurrence. 

 > Please see GRI 403-9 and GRI 403-10 on pages 126-129 for our performance on 

these metrics. 

GRI 403-1 

Occupational health and safety management system

Our Company’s EHS management system includes comprehensive programs 
focused on reducing risks, work-related injuries/illnesses and other safety 
incidents from our operations. We focus on safe facility design, process 
controls, operation and maintenance procedures, protection systems and 
emergency-response capabilities.

Our EHS Management System supports our Company’s objectives by 
promoting a strong EHS culture through visible leadership, active employee 
engagement and a focus on proactive identification and elimination of hazards. 

Our Employee Safety Committees demonstrate this EHS engagement in 
action. These Committees include workers and management in a partnership 
to proactively address EHS issues.

While we have reviewed the ISO 18001 Standard, we have not pursued 
certification because we believe that our current EHS management systems 
are robust and achieve our desired levels of EHS performance.

GRI 403-2 

Hazard identification, risk assessment and  
incident investigation

We identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis and apply the hierarchy of controls in order to eliminate 
hazards and minimize risks. We continually evaluate and work to improve 
our occupational health and safety management system.

Process safety

Our process safety program identifies, controls and manages risks associated 
with the manufacturing and handling of our human and animal health 
products. The program applies to operations that are subject to process 
safety regulations, and to our pilot plants, manufacturing operations 
and utility areas where process hazards may exist. In addition, we have 
implemented a structured, chemical-reaction-hazard review program for 
our research laboratories.

In the early stages of product development, we conduct chemical reaction 
and thermal testing of our intermediate materials and products to identify 
potential reactivity, fire and explosion hazards, and environmental risks. 
This testing continues throughout the life cycle of each product to ensure 
that we are aware of the process risks of each material and can properly 
manage these risks. Global process safety professionals work with operations 
and engineering personnel to conduct process hazard analyses to thoroughly 
evaluate our operations. These structured reviews take place at every stage 
from the initial start-up through the final process design. This ensures our 
facility design, equipment, operating controls and maintenance procedures 
are effective in identifying, evaluating, managing and mitigating process-
related hazards.

Non-routine hazardous work

Capital projects construction safety 

We have a strong construction safety program with a focus on zero harm 
to people, property and the environment. Our Global Engineering Solutions 
(GES) group oversees hundreds of contractors and thousands of skilled 
craft workers on our construction projects worldwide. Safety is integrated 
into all stages of our construction projects, beginning with the concept 
and design phases, and is carried through to Detailed Design, Construction 
and Commissioning/Qualification. In 2022, 10.5 million hours were spent in 
construction on GES Capital Project work. 

Our construction safety program mandates pre-job planning, hazard 
assessments and daily safety checks. We also conduct peer reviews by 
bringing together in-house engineers, contractors, the EHS construction 
team and other partners to conduct thorough project safety evaluations 
and share best practices. In 2022, we completed 64 peer safety reviews on 
projects, covering 100 percent of our active projects that were chosen for 
peer safety reviews.

The construction industry continues to see a negative trend related to 
the availability of contractor and craft resources. The impacts of this 
trend require management of resource availability issues, varied levels of 
experience and safety competencies. GES continues to use a “hyper-care” 
program to ensure additional supervision and safety oversight of new 
contractors, high-risk work scope contractors and  
less-experienced contractors.

We have developed global safety standards to minimize the potential for 
serious incidents when working at heights, entering confined spaces and 
working on or near machinery, piping and electrical systems. This global 
effort is focused on creating a rigorous and safe approach to risk reduction 
when performing these non-routine, high-hazard work activities. 

GES also uses a rigorous, third-party prequalification program—Highwire—to 
evaluate and score contractors and subcontractors. This tool allows the team 
to evaluate contractors’ safety programs, past safety performance, safety 
incident rates, experience modifier rate and training verification of craft, and 
reviews any regulatory citations prior to allowing them to bid on any projects.

Safety for non-Company personnel

All contractors working at our sites are required to follow a prequalification 
and EHS evaluation process as specified in our Company's Global Contractor 
Management Standard. They are assigned an internal “contractor liaison” 
to monitor EHS compliance, perform EHS inspections and evaluations and 
ensure they follow their safety compliance plans. Contractors are required 
to report and investigate all EHS incidents and near-miss events. They also 
work with site-based EHS contacts to identify and implement corrective and 
preventive actions, which are tracked to completion.

Integrated Facilities Management (IFM) partners are globally sourced 
companies that are responsible for supporting our Company for facility-
related tasks. IFM partners are required to follow our Company's EHS 
standards and site-specific EHS procedures in order to monitor compliance 
activities associated with their scope of services and meet EHS- and 
sustainability-related performance objectives.

IFM partners are managed through a central governance team. The 
governance process includes dedicated resources to measure, monitor 
and evaluate IFM partners' EHS and sustainability performance, as well as 
adherence to Company requirements on an ongoing basis. IFM partners 
proactively follow a continuous improvement process whereby each year, 
in addition to our Company requirements, specific targets are set up and 
monitored at the governance level.

Motor vehicle safety

The purpose of the motor vehicle safety program is to promote a strong 
safety culture for our employees who operate vehicles during the conduct 
of Company business. The program is designed to reduce the number and 
severity of motor vehicle accidents and injuries along with a reduction in 
violations. Our global motor vehicle safety standard and adopted programs, 
such as predictive analytics assessments, allow us to develop employee-
specific defensive driving action plans, and to promote safe driving skills and 
behaviors for our sales and marketing employees (who operate the majority 
of our business-use vehicles). 

Emergency response

We prioritize the prevention of incidents through equipment and facility 
design, operational and maintenance procedures and employee training. 
However, in the event that unplanned incidents occur, we maintain 
emergency preparedness and response capabilities at our facilities. 
Emergency response programs help secure the safety and well-being of 
our employees and visitors, the protection of the environment and nearby 
communities, as well as protecting our physical assets. We also conduct 
pre-emergency planning for credible emergency scenarios such as process 
upsets, fires, spills, releases, severe weather and security-related incidents.

Site-specific emergency response procedures include incident reporting and 
management, personnel evacuation, and medical and incident response and 
control. We routinely conduct emergency response drills and train employees 
in job-specific and site-specific emergency response duties.

Many of our manufacturing plants have on-site, trained emergency response 
teams and mobile fire and rescue apparatus that can respond to fires, medical 
emergencies, technical rescues and spills/releases. Most of our emergency 
response teams interact directly with their local community-based 
emergency responders and, in some cases, assist off-site when requested.

Loss prevention

We proactively assess and manage the risks associated with fires and natural 
catastrophes (e.g., hurricanes, floods, windstorms and earthquakes) through 
our Loss Prevention Program. This program focuses on eliminating or 
reducing the impact of potential loss events through:

•  Facility and process designs

•  Inspection, prevention and maintenance procedures

•  Fire suppression, detection and specialized protection systems

•  Emergency response and business continuity programs

We engage globally-recognized, external loss prevention engineering 
service providers to routinely inspect and review designs and modifications 
of facilities. This posture assists us in maintaining a high standard of loss 
prevention that corresponds to the level of operational risk, monetary value 
and supply chain importance.

Industrial hygiene

The Industrial Hygiene (IH) program helps safeguard employee health 
throughout all stages of research and manufacturing. Our IH professionals 
identify chemical, physical and biological hazards, and assess exposures and 
control risks. Based on industry-leading best practices, we accomplish this 
through a hierarchy of controls. These include: Prevention; Substitution; 
Engineering; Administrative; and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

Our practice when designing new processes and facilities is to build safety 
into our designs organically by eliminating risks, substituting less hazardous 
processes or materials and installing effective engineering and operational 
controls. We also confirm the ongoing effectiveness of these controls after 
installation through a robust monitoring program.

We use a similar approach when addressing existing processes and 
facilities. Our priority is to eliminate hazardous materials and processes. 
When elimination is not possible, we use less hazardous substitutes and 
then evaluate potential engineering controls to mitigate the remaining risk. 
Where engineering controls are insufficient, or not feasible, we establish 
effective work practice controls, including those that may require selected 
types of PPE. 

Biological safety

Our biological safety program aims to protect our employees, customers 
and communities by identifying, assessing and controlling biosafety 
and biosecurity risks. The biological safety program is designed to 
control biological exposure and support the research, development and 
manufacturing of vaccines and medicines for communicable and non-
communicable diseases. Our program supports UN SDG 3, and aligns with 
the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), GHSA Biosafety and Biosecurity 
Action Package.

In 2022, our Company launched an updated engineering design standard that 
governs fit-for-purpose biological laboratory facility design to support our 
pipeline. This enabled our Company to design Biological Safety Level 2  
(BSL-2) and BSL-3 laboratories for safe research and development of 
vaccines and therapeutics to combat endemic or emerging infectious

diseases like dengue, brucellosis and bovine botulism. In an effort to improve 
biosafety capabilities, our Biosafety Center of Excellence conducted a 
Biocontainment Engineering Workshop to increase the biosafety knowledge 
base of our engineers and biosafety professionals. The team also developed 
an engineering project-risk-assessment tool and integrated other biosafety 
tools into the existing Company global engineering project team roadmap to 
improve design decisions for new and renovated biological facilities.

We partner with our community of public and private sector biosafety 
professionals in order to help educate biorisk professionals globally, 
and develop guidelines that protect human and animal health and the 
environment. In 2022, we volunteered with American Biological Safety 
Association (ABSA) International to support ISO Technical Committee 212’s 
Working Group 5 to develop the ISO 35001 Implementation Guide, and 
to draft a new ISO Biosafety Professional Competency Standard. We also 
supported the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Zodiac Project 
to improve biosafety in veterinary diagnostic laboratories globally, and 
presented on sustainable effluent decontamination at the International 
Veterinary Biosafety Workgroup.

In 2022, our biological safety professionals facilitated 293 biorisk 
assessments to support research and development and manufacturing 
activities across all Company divisions. By developing and leveraging an 
asset called Biorisk Assessment and Repository (BAR), we believe that we 
have set new biorisk management standards for the industry. BAR evaluates 
biosafety, bioethics and biosecurity risk associated with biological materials 
and establishes sustainable risk-control strategies that protect human health 
and the environment. 

Ergonomics

We have implemented a program focused on the reduction of ergonomic risk in 
process, equipment design and the work environment. We identify ergonomic 
risk and exposure of tasks in all areas of the organization. Our ergonomic 
programs encourage employee participation in workplace assessments, 
risk identification and implementation of sustainable engineering controls. 
Where engineering controls are not feasible, administrative and behavioral 
controls are implemented including, but not limited to, job rotation, job hazard 
identification and body mechanics training. We also require an ergonomic 

design standards review for all new or renovated facilities and projects to 
maximize worker comfort and health and minimize ergonomics hazards and 
risk factors. In 2022, there was a 47 percent reduction in ergonomic lost time 
injuries (15 in 2021 vs 8 in 2022).

Our remote worker ergonomic assessment process and work-from-home 
furniture policy continues to prove successful in eliminating injuries and 
encouraging good working habits. This policy provides hybrid and remote 
workers with access to resources that guide proper home office workstation 
setup and identify appropriate furniture, equipment and solutions needed 
to maintain a healthy work-from-home environment. As a result of this 
program, there were no lost time, recordable or first aid ergonomic cases 
associated with work-from-home computer workstations in 2022.

Occupational health services

Occupational health principles apply to all employees and directly-supervised 
contingent workers. We promote compliance with both the letter and 
the spirit of applicable occupational health laws, Company policies and 
requirements. We prioritize continuous improvement and assess our 
improvements objectively through internal measurement and external 
benchmarking, incorporating best practices and participating in occupational 
health research where appropriate.

To meet the Company’s objectives, we focus on seven key areas:

•  Prevention and risk-minimization

•  Quality assurance

•  Global standards and communication

•  Education and training

•  Role of management

•  Collaboration with EHS

Prevention and risk minimization

Education and training

Well-informed and trained employees provide the backbone for maintaining 
employee health in the workplace. We assist in providing appropriate 
education and training programs for our employees, so that they understand 
potential health hazards and necessary precautions related to their job duties. 
We also invest in our occupational health team’s professional growth to foster 
business excellence in the conscientious execution of their responsibilities.

Role of management 

Managers are responsible for implementing and adhering to both Company 
and local (country or regional) occupational health policies. They may also 
provide input into occupational health policy and strategies. Similarly, we 
expect division and business unit leaders to make certain that their teams 
provide input on occupational health strategies, policies and programs, 
as appropriate. Above all, leaders ensure that their organization provides 
adequate resources to support occupational health performance.

The best way to maintain the occupational health of our employees is to 
reduce risk and prevent illnesses and injuries. Occupational Health Services 
collaborates closely with the EHS organization to identify and evaluate 
potential health risks to our employees in an effort to reduce adverse 
impacts. We take proactive steps to prevent occupational injury and 
illness through our Medical Surveillance program. This program evaluates 
new and existing workplace hazards and allows the teams to identify and 
implement procedures and clinical protocols to eliminate these hazards and 
prevent future occurrences. In the event of an occupational injury or illness, 
Occupational Health Services performs joint follow-up investigations with 
the EHS organization and conducts analyses to further refine our preventive 
efforts and reduce avoidable risks.

When employees are ill or injured at work or through personal circumstances, 
we support their recovery so they can return to work healthy to perform their 
jobs. When an employee experiences an occupational injury or illness, we 
promote and facilitate appropriate treatment and rehabilitation.

Quality assurance

Our Quality Assurance program ensures that both our occupational health 
staff and our external vendors for occupational health are compliant with our 
occupational health corporate policies, procedures and guidelines.

Global standards and communication

Our occupational health programs are not static, and we drive continuous 
improvement in their performance. We refine programs, policies and 
procedures based on evolving workplace hazards in the Company. We tie 
our occupational health performance to corporate and divisional goals and 
objectives, when applicable.

We adhere to and promote Company goals, programs, procedures and 
policies designed to provide a high level of respect for the health of our 
employees globally. We foster openness and respectful dialogue with our 
employees, anticipating and responding to concerns about our operations.

Management approach 

Our Global Learning and Development (GL&D) organization’s primary focus 
is to enable a diverse and accessible environment in which all can learn and 
thrive. We accomplish this by collaborating with business partners across the 
Company to understand critical business challenges and to align and prioritize 
learning solutions to support addressing those challenges. We then design, 
develop and execute innovative learning experiences to strengthen our 
workforce and drive business impact.

GL&D ensures that all learning opportunities are developed to allow for diversity 
of thought and an enriched accessible learning experience. We identify learning 
needs of our global diverse employee population through extensive discovery 

GRI 404-1 

Average hours of employee training

of learner personas, requirements and environments. Our strategy allows 
us to anticipate, identify, prioritize, design, develop and implement learning 
solutions that provide growth and development across five moments of an 
employee’s career.

These moments include:

•  In-role growth

•  Career acceleration

•  Leader development

•  Company and culture

•  Mandatory training

GL&D understands employee skills and capabilities must support our 
Company's aspiration and purpose. As a result, we continuously evaluate our 
organizational capability needs and retool the learning culture and strategy 
to support our employees.

Programs for upgrading employee skills and transition 
assistance programs

Our current talent management practices provide performance management, 
leadership development, talent assessments, and succession planning. Global 
Talent Management designs and implements the enterprise-wide talent 
management and leadership strategy aligned to business strategy to retain 
and attract talent, support and develop a diverse workforce and create a 
strong succession pipeline. Talent practices are supported by a human capital 
management system, which enables managers and employees to keep track 
of priorities, development plans, performance ratings, career aspirations, job 
experiences, skills, language proficiency, certifications and education.

Managers and employees are encouraged to meet throughout the year to 
discuss progress and accomplishments against their priorities and actions 
to enable development. Emphasis is placed on creating a culture of ongoing 
coaching and future-focused feedback. At the end of the year, colleagues 
summarize their achievements and assess the impact they have had on the 
organization, their team and their own development.

Managers conduct annual performance reviews of employees at all levels 
(except those subject to collective bargaining agreements) to guide individual 
decisions relating to development, compensation and rewards. Feedback 
on employee performance includes how well employees demonstrate our 
aspirational culture. We seek to emphasize not just what an employee 
achieves, but also how they achieve. Managers gather feedback about their 
employees and write performance reviews providing holistic feedback on 
employees’ accomplishments.

Transition assistance

Transition assistance programs may be provided to support employees who 
are exited as part of a workforce restructuring. Such benefits are subject to 
local plans, laws and country guidelines, but may include:

•  Severance benefits, which may include severance pay based on employee 

level and service

•  Outplacement job transition assistance

•  Continued health and wellness benefits for a defined period of time

Talent development focus 

We advance the learning and development of our global talent at all levels of 
the organization to support the advancement of our future leader pipeline 
along with the realization of our diversity and inclusion strategy.

Management approach

At our Company, we recognize the importance of embedding a culture of 
inclusion and belonging at every level of the organization. We look to have 
the diversity of our employees mirror the external world. This enables us

and operate our business in a way that ensures fairness and equality of

With our commitment to employee health paramount, we continue to focus

Our CEO further reinforces our commitment to GD&I. Viewing GD&I as 
a strategic business imperative, he advocates for diversity and inclusion 
through the following commitments:

•  Approving intentional efforts to ensure equality of opportunity 

•  Driving accountability through meetings with his Executive Team of direct

•  Conferring with our Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Diversity

Pay equity

We have had a longstanding commitment to fair and equitable pay for all 
employees doing similar work. This commitment is consistent with our core 
values of integrity, fairness and treating all people with dignity and respect. 
Having the right culture, systems and practices for talent recruitment and 
development are critical in driving our ability to compete in global markets 
where talent is increasingly scarce and diverse. Diversity, equity and inclusion 
are among our ethical and strategic imperatives.

Pay equity is a critical principle at our Company. We maintain a Pay Equity 
Council that is deeply engaged in our pay equity initiatives. The Pay Equity 
Council is jointly led by our vice president of Diversity and Inclusion and senior 
vice president of Global Rewards & HR Operations. Among its members are 
leaders within our GD&I, Compensation and Benefits, Talent Acquisition and 
Employment Legal organizations.

Pay equity is a topic that is rightly receiving a great deal of attention. While 
many other organizations have only recently begun to explore how to pay 
their employees equitably, providing fair and equitable pay has been one of 
the pillars of our compensation philosophy for many years.

Our efforts toward pay equity include:

•  Establishing clear and transparent pay practices and policies to ensure 
that we are paying our employees equitably across all genders, races 
and ethnicities

•  Basing compensation on job-related factors such as the nature of the job, 

work location, and employees’ relative skills and work experience

•  Training our people managers on our diversity, equity and inclusion 

policies to ensure that decisions regarding employees, including those 
related to compensation, are based on legitimate job-related criteria and 
not personal characteristics such as gender, race or ethnicity

•  Affirming our commitment to fair and equitable pay by encouraging 

dialogue between people managers and employees to address pay-related 
questions and concerns

In 2022, as part of our commitment to increase transparency and visibility 
into our pay equity efforts, we conducted several education sessions, 
equipped our leaders with pay equity resources and engaged with employees 
around the globe.

With the support of external experts and legal partners, we have continued 
to conduct annual pay equity studies in the U.S. and abroad. The pay equity 
studies take into account job-related factors as described above, and allow us 
to identify whether any adjustments to compensation would be sensible to 
ensure that we continue to pay our employees equitably. Where appropriate, 
based on the determinations of our pay equity studies, we make base salary 
adjustments to maintain pay equity across gender, race and ethnicity. 

In 2022, our pay equity study achieved nearly worldwide coverage, 
encompassing approximately 90 percent of our global employee population, 
or nearly 60,000 employees. In the U.S., our study showed that we have 
achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for female and male employees, 
and that we have achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for non-white 
(including Black, Hispanic and Asian employees) and white employees. 
Globally, targeted base-pay adjustments were rarely necessary. We remain 
committed to ensuring that pay equity is maintained for all employees.

Our continuing focus on pay equity furthers our goal of being the employer 
of choice for workers of diverse backgrounds, and it supports our efforts 
to attract and retain the best talent and reward performance consistent 
with our Leadership Standards. These are clear business imperatives for our 
Company, and we remain firmly committed to them.

Leadership development

As part of our strategy to drive business results and advance our purpose, 
we remain committed to leadership development to support equity for 
our employees across all dimensions of diversity, including those you can 
see and those you cannot. We continue to develop and offer leadership 
programs to promote equality and publicly report on our progress to achieve 
gender equality. 

 > See GRI 404 on page 130 for more information on our leadership programs to 

promote equality.

Building a more inclusive workplace and a 
culture of belonging

A major priority at our Company is to ensure our employees feel a sense of 
belonging. We promote programs for people managers that support inclusion 
and that our leaders use to share their perspectives. Our Pulse surveys allow 
us to measure our employees' perceptions on inclusion and other critical 
workforce issues. The Pulse surveys are just one of the avenues we use to 
directly engage employees and remain accountable to their needs. They also 
allow us to be responsive to employee feedback on workforce issues and to 
integrate their input into decision-making. We are proud of the fact that 
across an average of our 2022 surveys, 81 percent of our employees stated 
that they feel a sense of belonging at our Company. Also, 87 percent of our 
employees felt their people leader actively supported diversity and inclusion 
in their work group.

Related to our focus on inclusion is our commitment to a decade-long 
practice of understanding, measuring and acting to sustain high employee 
engagement. We maintain a practice of listening deeply to our employees. 
This is critical to our own decision-making, and influences leaders across 
the organization. Many of our EBRGs offer listening forums to colleagues 
to foster authentic and courageous conversations in an emotionally 
safe environment.

Going forward, we are publicly committed to maintaining or exceeding our 
current employee engagement index score through 2025, as measured 
through Pulse surveys, which are conducted multiple times a year.

Employee retention, recognition and people 
leader capability

The past year reflects our ability to continually attract and retain highly 
qualified people, strengthen our competitiveness and mitigate employee 
turnover. We have held ourselves accountable to actions designed to provide 
equality of opportunity and have increased our diverse representation. Last 
year, we also shared our goals for improving diverse representation in senior 
management, including women and people of Black/African American and 
Latino/Hispanic descent.

We aim to create more opportunities for underrepresented groups by 
evaluating our hiring processes to determine where we can remove barriers. 
This includes training our people managers on strategies to mitigate 
unconscious bias in the candidate selection, hiring and recognition process.

In addition to our enterprise-wide, unconscious-bias education (first 
introduced to the organization in 2014), we have developed a Learning 
Journey framework focused on critical capabilities, behavioral expectations 
and targeted learning assets to continue to drive our strategic focus and 
investment in building a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment 
for all our employees.

sponsorship from the chief diversity officer and the chief of staff to the 
chairman and CEO. This included the launch of the Ally Resource Center, an 
internal library of over 125 resources featuring active allyship and content 
from each of the 10 EBRGs. Our inaugural allyship webcast drew nearly 
800 attendees from over 40 countries.

Gender-sensitive recruitment and retention

We recognize that talent acquisition is pivotal in sourcing, attracting 
diverse talent and supporting hiring people managers, and in eliminating 
unconscious bias in the selection process.

Talent Acquisition uses a cutting-edge technology platform to scan 
the language used in job postings and to highlight suggested language 
changes that ensure our job descriptions are gender neutral and inclusive. 
This is in addition to a careful review of job postings to ensure there is no 
biased language. 

Opportunities for people with disabilities

We encourage a culture of transparency, and align with external 
organizations that share our vision for full disability inclusion to foster a 
culture of inclusion and belonging that supports people with disabilities.

The Valuable 500

In 2022, we became one of 75 companies to participate in a new mentoring 
program, Generation Valuable. This program pairs an employee with a 
disability with an executive for a mentorship. 

Disability inclusion in our supply chain

In 2022, we joined the Disability:IN Procure Access Initiative, a business-
to-business initiative facilitated by Disability:IN and their Digital 
Accessibility Program.

Digital accessibility

In 2021, we implemented a global digital accessibility policy, seeking to ensure 
equal access across the Company digital landscape—for the internal workforce 
as well as external patients and consumers and, in 2022, implemented the 
5-year digital accessibility roadmap. 

Universal design

Designing for accessibility, usability and inclusion in the built environment 
goes beyond the Americans with Disabilities Act. We created a universal 
design standard for our facilities around the globe, in order to make a 
difference in the lives of our employees and guests. This approach is 
especially critical for a workplace centered around science and invention, 
and our mission to save and improve lives.

A culture of employee well-being

To succeed, we prioritize the health, well-being and safety of our employees. 
We are committed to continuing the special emphasis we placed on 
our employees' well-being during the pandemic, including reinforcing a 
collaborative culture and ways of working that drive long-term success. 

 > Please see our Well-being Report on our corporate website to see how we support 

employee well-being in the U.S. and around the globe.

Expanding our pipeline of diverse talent

OneTen Initiative

OneTen is a coalition of CEOs and leading companies helping to close 
the opportunity gap for Black talent in America and to ignite potential 
for generations to come. Under the leadership of our CEO and Chairman 
Rob Davis, we have made progress towards our commitment to OneTen’s 
mission of hiring, promoting, and advancing one million Black individuals who 
do not have four-year college degrees into family-sustaining careers over 
10 years. In 2022, we posted approximately 900 job roles without a bachelor's 
degree requirement. We also launched our first Skills-First apprenticeship 
program with apprentices in digital marketing, data analytics, and information 
technology. Consistent with our commitment to diversity, equity and 
inclusion, our Company is determined to be a role model within OneTen and 
adopt a Skills-First talent approach within appropriate business areas. 

 > To learn more, please visit the story on our corporate website.

In the past year, we have continued outreach to Historically Black Colleges 
and Universities (HBCUs) by partnering with several organizations, 
including the College Diversity Network and the National Urban League, 
to focus on building deep partnerships with colleges, students, faculty and 
alumni of HBCUs. We also focus on barriers that may limit the employee 
candidate pool, including the geographic location of open positions and job 
prerequisites of prior pharmaceutical experience. To broaden our access 
to diverse talent, we post some positions with an option to work virtually, 
offer relocation services and carefully consider whether prior pharmaceutical 
experience is required. 

We leverage key partnerships such as:

•  Ascend

•  Best Buddies

•  Disability: IN

•  Executive Leadership Council (ELC)

•  INROADS College Links

•  Lesbians Who Tech

•  National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME)

•  National Urban League

•  Out & Equal

•  Women of Color in Pharma (WOCIP)

Skills-First

Skills-First is a paradigm shift in how our Company attracts, develops and 
advances talent with an increased focus on skills instead of a four-year degree 
or credentials for appropriate roles. This approach creates equitable access 
to meaningful career opportunities for a broader pool of diverse candidates. 
It also helps to fuel innovation within our Company by bringing in new ideas 
and perspectives. In 2022 alone, our Company posted 900 roles not requiring 
a four-year college degree. Key partnerships helping to accelerate our  
Skills-First transformation include OneTen and Year Up, among others.

Year Up

We are among the 250 corporations partnering with the innovative 
organization Year Up. This nonprofit seeks to ensure equitable access 
to economic opportunity, education and justice for all young adults. 
They accomplish this by closing the job market opportunity gap for 
economically-disadvantaged youth by offering six months each of intensive 
training and corporate internship in either information technology, financial 
operations, sales and customer support, business operations, or software 
development and support at major corporations. In 2022, the Company 
provided approximately 90 student internships to candidates sourced by 
Year Up, with plans for continued growth and expansion of this partnership 
in the future.

Minorities in Agriculture, Natural Resources and Related 
Sciences (MANRRS)

Our Animal Health Division partners with MANRRS to support the 
identification of diverse talent from the agricultural sciences and related 
fields and to expose them to the variety of career paths available in the animal 
health industry in addition to the veterinary field. The growing areas of 
connected technology and other smart data products and services for animal 
health and well-being—where Merck Animal Health is a global leader—are 
examples of exciting career paths that are available to today’s talent.

Merck Animal Health Veterinary Scholarship Program

Our scholarship program offers grants to all outstanding veterinary students 
to further their education as they pursue careers in animal medicine. In 
2022, over $1.2 million in scholarships were awarded to 311 students from 
70 different countries.

NextGen Network global reverse mentoring program

We are seeing the impact and value of having multiple generations in the 
workplace. In 2018, the NextGen Network created a global reverse mentoring 
program called GEN2GEN. The success of the program is evidenced 
by program participation across 58 countries. GEN2GEN empowers 
generational change uniquely by offering co-mentoring partnerships where 
our younger generations advise our more-tenured generations.

Extending our GD&I commitment beyond 
our employees

Our work in equity does not stop at the doors of our Company. It continues 
outside our employee base and into communities all over the world, including 
communities that have historically been underserved or underfunded. We 
engage with partners to advance the efforts of our global diversity and 
inclusion commitments and to support underserved communities all over 
the globe.

CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion

Five years ago, we signed a pledge to join the CEO Action for Diversity & 
Inclusion. This commitment extends beyond our employees to supporting 
businesses around the world by making a difference in global economic 
inclusion. We continue to work with this vital organization to share 
best practices and identify new opportunities to foster diversity, equity 
and inclusion. 

Economic inclusion and supplier diversity

In 2022, 14 percent of our total procurement spend went to minority-, 
women-, veteran-, LGBTQ+- and disability-owned business enterprises.

It is important to provide definitions and context for diverse suppliers. 
Diverse suppliers are businesses that are 51 percent managed, controlled 
and operated by a person or persons of the following categories:

•  Minority: Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American

•  Women

•  LGBTQ+

•  Veteran, service-disabled veteran

•  Disability-owned business

As stated in our Human Rights Public Policy Statement, we strive to avoid 
causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through our own 
activities and seek to prevent or mitigate adverse impacts that are directly 
linked to our operations and products.

We have put in place appropriate policies, processes, training and monitoring 
systems to address key human rights issues. Support and respect for the 
protection of human rights is embedded and reflected in our operational 
policies and procedures, as summarized in the table below.

Remedy

As part of our efforts to protect against business-related human rights 
abuses, we have established a grievance mechanism that allows employees 
and workers to report concerns in a confidential manner without fear of 
retaliation. This grievance mechanism, and associated reporting channels, 
are fundamental to ensuring that employees and workers have access to an 
effective remedy whenever human rights impacts occur. 

 > For more information on mechanisms for raising concerns, please see GRI 2-26 on 

pages 44-45.

We expect our suppliers to encourage all workers to report concerns 
or suspected illegal activities without threat of reprisal, intimidation or 
harassment, and to investigate and take corrective action if needed. In 
addition, we expect our suppliers to provide workers with information on 
how to confidentially report concerns and ensure that reporting workers are 
protected from retaliation.

Governance

Our oversight and monitoring of business-related human rights risks is 
supported by relevant internal functions and business units, including Human 
Resources; Global Safety & Environment; Global Supplier Management; 
Supply Chain Management; Ethics & Compliance; Global Security; Global 
Privacy Office, Information Risk Management; Enterprise Risk Management; 
and the Office of Social Business Innovation.

GRI 412-1 

Operations that have been subjected to human  
rights reviews

We perform supplier labor and human rights audits (using independent 
third-party service providers) at select direct material suppliers’ facilities 
located in countries that are known to present an increased risk of human 
rights abuses.

 > For more information, please see GRI 414 on page 145.

GRI 412-2 

Employee training on human rights policies and procedures

Business-related human rights issues are embedded within our internal 
training programs to help maintain employee awareness and understanding 
of our Company’s expectations. Examples of human-rights-related topics 
covered by existing training programs include health and safety; privacy and 
data protection; harassment and discrimination; and diversity and inclusion; 
as well as training that explains how to confidentially report concerns, 
emphasizing the importance of speaking up. Completion of assigned training 
is closely monitored and reported.

GRI 412-3 

Investment agreements and contracts that include 
human rights clauses or underwent screening

Our Global Supplier Management Group (GSMG) function oversees contract 
development and execution activities associated with the sourcing and 
selection of our suppliers of goods and services. Through our standard 
contracts and agreements, we seek a written commitment from suppliers 
to respect and abide by the principles set forth in our Business Partner Code 
of Conduct (BPCC). Our BPCC states that business partners are expected to 
uphold the human rights of workers, treat workers with dignity, respect the 
protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and ensure that they 
are not complicit in human rights abuses.

potential risks may exist beyond Tier 2 suppliers.

We continue work to detect and address the risks in our supply chain through:

GRI 414 

Management approach

Supplier selection 

Supplier due diligence assessment for labor 
practices and human rights

We respect human rights and support transparency in our supply chain. 
We are committed to upholding the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative 
(PSCI) Principles and we require our suppliers to operate in compliance with 
all applicable laws. We have a formal program led by our Global Supplier 
Management Group (GSMG) to evaluate the risks for labor and human rights 
(LHR) in our supply chain. We have a Conflict Minerals due diligence program 
and complete the associated annual reporting.

Our policies

Our policies serve as our standards of conduct for engaging with stakeholders. 
They are founded on our Code of Conduct (Our Values & Standards) and are 
used to navigate and guide our decisions. They help us identify, address and 
mitigate risks.

 > For information on our policies, please visit our Policies & Positions and  

Sustainability Resources pages on our corporate website.

Human rights and labor risks

We recognize that companies with supply chains that extend into high-risk 
countries potentially face greater LHR risks. Our Company can be exposed to 
these risks through our supply chain, as some of our third-party suppliers and 
service providers operate in higher-risk countries.

To help manage and address potential risks associated with third-party 
business relationships, GSMG has an established cross-functional, third-
party risk management committee and program. LHR risks are considered 

Selecting suppliers that are socially responsible and who share our 
commitments to ethics and integrity. We strive to obtain the services, goods, 
active ingredients, components, finished goods or other products in a way 
that is lawful and fair.

Expectations

Setting and communicating our expectations of suppliers, including those 
related to child labor, forced labor and human trafficking. We use our 
Business Partner Code of Conduct to communicate our expectations. It has 
been translated for all countries in which we operate.

Supply chain mapping

Mapping our supply chain to identify which of our suppliers operate in 
countries that are known to present a significant risk of LHR issues. We use 
this information to help us decide upon the level of due diligence that may 
be necessary.

Due diligence

Conducting appropriate supplier due diligence to help determine the level of 
risk presented by suppliers, including potential new (prospective) suppliers 
as well as our existing suppliers. Our supplier due diligence process for LHR 
targets direct materials suppliers, including external manufacturing suppliers 
and contract manufacturing organizations. 

A self-assessment questionnaire is used to gather information on freely 
chosen employment, child labor, employment practices, employee 
disclosures, fair treatment, wages, benefits and working hours. Suppliers’ 
responses are used to judge whether that supplier has programs and/or 
procedures in place to address potential risks for labor and human rights, 
including modern slavery and human trafficking. The information gathered as 
part of due diligence is used to determine the acceptability of suppliers’ local 
practices. Results are then applied by GSMG to inform our supplier selection 
and risk management processes.

Contracts

Seeking written commitment from suppliers to respect the principles set 
forth in our Business Partner Code of Conduct through our contracts/
agreements. Our contract templates contain a Business Partner Code of 
Conduct compliance clause that includes provisions related to modern slavery.

Auditing

Performing LHR audits at select supplier facilities to verify their conformance 
with our expectations (as stated in our Business Partner Code of Conduct), 
and working with them to address identified nonconformances. We use 
independent third-party audit firms to perform announced LHR audits at 
suppliers’ facilities. When preparing our audit schedule, we consider the 
industry risk, the category of materials supplied, the country in which the 
supplier operates and results of past due diligence.

Remedial actions

Tracking and reporting on the closure of remedial actions taken by suppliers 
to address identified nonconformances (gaps/concerns) revealed by supplier 
LHR auditing.

Management approach 

Our Company's Political Contributions Committee engages in the political 
process—at both the federal and state levels—to educate policymakers, 
lawmakers and candidates on policy issues critical to our industry and our 
Company’s core purpose to invent new medicines and vaccines to save lives. 
The Center for Political Accountability, at the Zicklin Center for Business 
Ethics Research at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, 
has recognized our Company as a "Trendsetter" for the last six years 
in their annual CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and 
Accountability report.

We continue to make bipartisan contributions that are carefully considered 
on a case-by-case basis. In establishing our political giving priorities, our 
contributions committee considers various factors to prioritize candidates 
who support policies that enhance innovation and patient access to health 
care. We certainly do not agree with every position that every recipient of 
PAC support takes on every important social and business issue.

Political contributions

We spent a total of $989,900 in U.S. corporate political contributions in 
2022. A large portion of these funds were used to support the campaigns 
of 410 candidates in 21 states plus the District of Columbia. The party 
breakdown of the contributions for individual candidates was 49.76 percent 
Democratic, 49.76 percent Republican, and 0.49 percent Independent. 
Republicans held a majority in 61 chambers, Democrats held the majority 
in 37 chambers and in one chamber power is divided equally between 
the parties.

Support was also provided under this program to state legislative leadership 
committees, industry-affiliated political action committees, and several

Management approach

Our quality strategy is focused on maintaining sustained quality and 
compliance excellence through focused digital technologies, effective 
oversight and risk mitigation, engaged and empowered colleagues and 
communities, and a mature Quality Management posture. Our quality 
strategy is a key enabler to ensuring patient safety and the overall quality 
and continuous supply of our products.

We operate in a highly complex and ever-changing regulatory landscape 
driven by many different factors, including novel scientific discoveries 
and technological advancements. Specifically, we are leveraging new 
technological advancements such as integrated IT tools, artificial 
intelligence (AI) and streamlined digital platforms to further enhance how 
we manufacture high-quality products. We apply and adhere to a strict set 

of quality standards, and have policies and procedures in place to define, 
measure, control and sustain product quality excellence. Our Global Quality 
organization is responsible for establishing the standards to ensure that our 
Company’s products are manufactured, tested, released and distributed in 
compliance with regulatory requirements.

We continuously strive to enhance these standards in order to ensure 
ongoing compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs). 
We provide appropriate, ongoing training on cGMPs for our employees so 
they are prepared to perform their duties effectively. Our quality system not 
only ensures that all applicable employees are trained, but also monitors the 
effectiveness of the training provided. 

Our medicines and vaccines are widely tested before they are approved for 
marketing. This testing is governed by a comprehensive regulatory scheme 
and by our research policies. We assess the safety of our products in rigorous 
nonclinical and clinical trials prior to seeking regulatory approval. Following 
approval of our drugs, vaccines or devices our Company continues to monitor 
their safety profiles.

regulatory authorities.

This testing and refining of a product can take years to complete. When 
all of the required testing is completed and found to be satisfactory by 
the appropriate government regulatory agency, the product is approved 
to be sold. Once a product is on the market, we follow all applicable 
pharmacovigilance rules and findings are assessed and reported to 
regulatory authorities. 

Regulatory affairs

A consistent, science-based regulatory environment is one of the key 
conditions necessary for innovation and for providing our customers with

Counterfeit products

We invest in an industry-leading, rigorous and intelligence-led product 
integrity strategy that is solely focused on protecting patients from the harm 
associated with counterfeit and diverted medicines. Our Global Security 
Group oversees our global product integrity strategy and leads its execution. 
The strategy seeks to protect our patients and our Company’s reputation 
from the negative impacts of counterfeit medicines using a three-pronged 
strategy focused on:

1.  Securing the supply chain

2.  Investigations and enforcement

3.  Raising public and stakeholder awareness

In 2022, we continued our commitment to increasing our focus in this area 
and have strategically enhanced our ability to make a long-term impact on 
patient safety through various education campaigns. We are committed 
to cooperating with relevant government agencies, other pharmaceutical 
manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, health professionals, consumer 
groups and key related organizations in fighting the problem of counterfeit 
pharmaceutical products, and in educating the public about the risks of 
counterfeit products and how to protect against them.

This effort includes a multi-pronged approach to communicating the threat 
that counterfeit medicines pose and to mitigating this threat as effectively as 
possible while recognizing that it cannot be entirely eliminated.

Appropriate collaboration and information-sharing in order to raise public and 
stakeholder awareness of the issue and risks are a crucial focus of our product 
integrity program. Through active partnerships with other pharmaceutical 
companies, and with organizations focused on security, patient safety 
and public health, we provide effective advocacy on high-priority anti-
counterfeiting policy initiatives.

These collaborative efforts support the production of reports, white papers 
and data-circulation initiatives, as well as promote the intelligence sharing 
necessary to combat threats from counterfeit medicines.

The anti-counterfeiting data below details the number of new suspected 
and substantiated counterfeit events in 2022 and for the previous four 
years. It reflects the current status of each event for all years presented as of 
February 2023.

Throughout 2022, Global Security addressed 2,102 product integrity events 
in 90 countries, involving counterfeit, diversion, supply chain security, 
tampering and brand security (non-Merck, unapproved generic product). 
Approximately 20 percent of these events have been proactively investigated 
by Global Security to identify new or emerging product integrity threats, or 
to further characterize and mitigate known threats.

We enable meaningful enforcement actions as a key strategic priority, and in 
2022 our product integrity activity led to 166 arrests and the seizure of more 
than 11,009 units of counterfeit or illicit versions of our products. There were 
65 prosecutions resulting from product integrity investigations in 2022.

2 Evidence from ongoing investigations of suspected counterfeit products can result in recategorization.

Another crucial aspect of investigations is the forensic analysis of questionable 
products. This forensic testing is aimed at concluding whether a questionable 
product is counterfeit, diverted or otherwise illicit. Counterfeit products 
are characterized to gain further intelligence and understanding of the 
counterfeiters and the threats to public health. We also have forensic 
detection devices in the field to analyze and detect counterfeits in regions 
around the world.

As counterfeiters improve their skills and techniques, our forensic scientists 
have pioneered the use of several analytical tools for the detection and 
characterization of counterfeit medicines and continue to explore new 
analytical tools that would increase their forensic testing capabilities. 
Lab findings are shared with regulatory and/or law-enforcement agencies 
and may be used to support subsequent enforcement actions and 
legal proceedings.

There were 771 unique questioned samples received as evidence and 
prepared for forensic testing in relation to active events in 2022. As part of 
our proactive awareness program, throughout 2022 Global Security trained 
approximately 1,734 law-enforcement personnel in more than 44 countries 
regarding the patient safety risks associated with counterfeit and diverted 
medication. Global Security also launched an internal training program on 
the Counterfeit, Diversion and Tampering (CDT) reporting process in late 
2017. To date, more than 96,000 employees and contractors have completed 
this training globally.

Supply chain security and serialization

Our proactive focus on managing supply chain security risk is based on our 
careful implementation and management of strict policies and procedures 
designed to protect the legitimate distribution of our products. We require 
customers to purchase our products directly from our Company or from 
authorized distributors listed publicly on our corporate website.

We maintain our commitment to ensure compliance with established 
Company policies, standards and procedures throughout the supply chain 
by identifying vulnerabilities and threats to the supply network. Resources 
are positioned globally to monitor and manage our security programs and 
investigate incidents when they occur. As a certified Importer under the 
Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) Program, we are 
validated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection as an elite Tier 3 Member 
recognized as implementing best practices in supply chain security. This adds 
an important layer to the security of our products and materials imported to 
the U.S.

Serialization—adding a 2D barcode with a unique identification number on 
each package that goes to market—is one of the tools we are investing in 
to secure our supply chain and prevent or detect counterfeiting. A serial 
number on individual packages may enable anyone along the supply 
chain—from a distributor to a pharmacist to a patient—to scan the code 
and verify it as a serial number corresponding to a genuine product of 
our Company. Serialization can add a robust layer to our product security 
platform. When associated with a regulatory mandate that specifies effective 
implementation and reporting to a national database, this method of product 
tracking can become a more meaningful product security tool.

Many jurisdictions around the world are requiring serialization on 
pharmaceutical packages or are considering such mandates. However, each 
country’s regulations are different, which makes it very challenging for our 
packaging sites and distribution networks to meet these diverse and intricate 
requirements, with additional complexity as reporting requirements are 
phased in.

We launched the Global Product Serialization Initiative in 2012, with the 
goal of meeting these varying requirements in a robust, standardized and 
effective way based upon GS-1 standards. 

Through these efforts, we are currently in compliance with applicable 
regulatory requirements related to serialization. We are also working with 
industry associations and regulatory authorities to better understand 
potential new requirements and to advocate for simple, standardized and 
common-sense regulations that can be effective at protecting against 
counterfeit medicines.

In addition to our compliance with regulatory requirements related to 
serialization, we are also exploring opportunities to deploy voluntary 
serialization and secondary verification technologies to further enhance 
the security and traceability of our products. These multifactor verification 
systems would be enabled by blockchain nodes and applications that allow 
for secure and immutable product tracing that could be accessed by all supply 
chain partners and end users. We are currently running several proof-of-
concept and pilot studies involving these emerging technologies, as well 
as participating in active industry associations, such as PharmaLedger, to 
further develop and apply these digital solutions.

Clinical trial site monitoring, design, conduct 
and oversight

We have a longstanding commitment to sharing the results of our clinical 
trials, regardless of their outcome, in a timely manner. If a clinical trial of 
a marketed product is terminated early for safety reasons, we promptly 
disclose medically important information to regulatory authorities and the 
public, update the status on ClinicalTrials.gov within 30 days and submit a 
manuscript to a journal (or post a summary online) within 12 months after the 
last patient’s last visit occurs. If the trial was terminated for efficacy reasons, 
the results will be disclosed within 12 months after the last patient’s last 
visit occurs. 

Summaries of terminated trials will provide information about patient 
disposition, safety and adverse experiences, as well as an explanation as 
to why the trial was terminated early. We comply with all applicable laws 
and regulations associated with the registration of clinical trials in publicly 
accessible registries and subsequent posting of the results from these trials. 
We have put in place the processes necessary for compliance with the Food 
and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and the EU Clinical Trials 
Regulation No 536/2014 (EU-CTR), including those related to clinical trial 
registration and posting results. 

For those who analyze, report or publish the results of clinical trials, a clinical 
trial registry also provides information on trials in progress and the ability 
to track such trials over the course of development. Company-sponsored 
and -conducted clinical trials involving patients assigned treatment with 
investigational and marketed products are registered at trial initiation on 
ClinicalTrials.gov, EUclinicaltrials.eu and ENCePP.eu.

In accordance with our public policy position statement on clinical trial 
ethics, all investigational studies in human subjects are conducted in a 
manner consistent with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines for the 
protection of human subjects, including those issued by the International 
Council for Harmonisation: Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP). However, 
individual country regulations and guidelines should remain the primary 
determinant of specific requirements for the conduct of medical research. 
In all regions, we have a commitment, where appropriate, to the study of 
diverse patient populations, including underrepresented groups, women 
and children. As a result, we strive to obtain information among diverse

Health literacy

Health literacy is essential to our overall strategy. We incorporate health 
literacy into all aspects of a product's development and life cycle, from clinical 
testing to labeling and packaging to patient education. In 2020, we founded a 
worldwide community of practice for health literacy, with membership from 
eight different nations and various corporate divisions.

This community of practice was established to assist in identifying and 
organizing health literacy advocates with the goal of training and educating 
colleagues more broadly, both through formalized, concerted efforts and 
through incidental collaboration in the course of daily work. 

In the fourth quarter of 2021, the community of practice launched an internal 
health literacy dictionary with more than 1,000 words, and established an 
internal health literacy portal for the exchange of materials and best practices. 

We are dedicated to increasing people's health literacy in the U.S. and 
around the world. As part of this commitment, our health literacy team 
has developed a novel method to enhance the patient labeling process for 
new compounds. 

The purpose of this is to validate comprehension across all the different 
consumer categories, with a particular emphasis on those who have lower 
levels of health literacy. To date, 10 of our medicines have FDA-authorized 
patient labels that were produced with input from patients whose health 
literacy skills ranged from low to high. Employees who create and assess 
patient labeling for novel compounds have been required to undergo training 
in health literacy methods for patient labels since 2021.

Over the past 20 years, we have developed and continually improved 
a comprehensive global privacy program that promotes organizational 
accountability for privacy, data governance, and data protection across our 
business and with our collaborative partners and suppliers. We were the first 
in the world to obtain regulatory approval in the EU for Binding Corporate 
Rules (BCRs), based in part on our existing Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPRs) certified program.

This achievement demonstrates that organizations can rely on common 
internal standards and processes to govern international data transfers 
across both the EU and APEC regions to simplify their ability to address the 
growing regulatory challenges in this area. 

Our holistic approach to privacy has its origins in biomedical research ethics 
and the protection of participants in the research studies that we sponsor 
and conduct. We have adapted human subject research ethics standards for 
risk-benefit analysis, transparency, anonymization, coding, and prior review 
to other activities and processes involving data about people.

Regulators around the world are increasingly adopting regulations similar to, 
or modeled on, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We are 
well positioned in that our global privacy program is based on the GDPR. 
Our global privacy program is also intended to be flexible and adaptable to 
be compliant to new laws and regulations that take effect in the jurisdictions 
where we conduct business. Examples include the California Consumer 
Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA); the 
Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) in Virginia; the Privacy Act (ColPA) in 
Colorado; the Consumer Privacy Act (CPA) in Utah; the Personal Data Privacy 
and Online Monitoring Act (PDPOMA) in Connecticut; and major revisions to 
the Data Protection Acts in China, Canada, and Indonesia. 

In addition, there is increased regulatory scrutiny and interest in companies 
that seek to collect and monetize personal information without full 
transparency and permission from data subjects. We anticipate that 
regulators will continue to increase requirements in these areas and levy 
fines. We believe that we are well positioned for these changes due to the 
deployment of a comprehensive, closed-loop privacy program and our active 
engagement with regulators around the world. 

The Global Privacy Office reports to our chief ethics and compliance officer 
who reports directly to our chief executive officer. Oversight of our global 
privacy program is conducted within the Privacy and Data Protection Board 
(PDPB). This is a cross-functional governance board that connects to our 
Company's Corporate Compliance Committee. The PDPB meets quarterly. 

We are increasingly reliant on third-party partners and service providers to 
assist us in our global operations. Just as we need to pay close attention to 
privacy and data protection, so do the third parties that comprise our supply 
chain. Our Company employs a robust third-party due diligence process to 
ensure that we only do business with reputable third parties who share our 
values and standards.

Our approach is one of accountability and transparency. The heart of this 
program is a leveraged, world-class Global Privacy Program that manifests 
itself throughout the world as a network of over 250 Privacy Stewards. 
Program maturity is measured through a combination of annual privacy 
self-assessments at the entity and organization level, and by comprehensive 
privacy audits conducted by internal audit.

We also provide annual mandatory cybersecurity training to communicate 
and reinforce the guidelines in the Information Security Standards Handbook 
and our commitment to a strong cybersecurity culture. We have established 
a systematic approach for ensuring employees can understand and comply 
with Company policies. We developed a robust cybersecurity training 
and awareness program that frequently and consistently delivers both 
compulsory and voluntary learning opportunities designed to encourage 
employees to make security-aware decisions regarding our Company’s 
information security risks. Topics include, but are not limited to, information 
protection, identity, email, browsing and mobile security. Employees are also 
expected to maintain an up-to-date record of their qualifications that details 
relevant cybersecurity work experience, skills, certifications and internal, 
industry or vendor-provided training they receive.

Substantiated complaints regarding breaches of privacy 
or losses of personal data

We have a well-established process by which privacy incidents can be 
reported to the Global Privacy Office and be investigated. The first step of 
this process is to verify the facts reported and to substantiate the concern. 
In 2022, we received 217 substantiated privacy concerns, which marks a 
49 percent reduction compared to the previous year. This reduction was 
mainly due to consistent network traffic monitoring and increased privacy 
and cybersecurity awareness efforts. Four out of 217 incidents were deemed 
to be reportable to data protection authorities and/or data subjects.

We recognize and embrace the gender spectrum and diversity of our employees, and have internally established voluntary Self ID options for employees to self report on their gender identity.

The totals in this report may not equal 100 percent due to rounding or employees who have not reported their gender and or race ethnicity.

Thank you for your interest in Merck and our ongoing commitment to operating responsibly and creating value for patients, our stakeholders and our business.

We continue to take inspiration from our purpose and our unique opportunity to use the power of leading edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

Sustainable value creation is core to how we do business as we work to advance global health, apply innovative science and ultimately protect and improve the health of people and animals through the development and delivery of medicines, vaccines and technology solutions.

We are passionate about this work and committed to making a positive difference for patients and the world while driving strong business outcomes.

Working globally as One Team, we organize our sustainability efforts across four focus areas to create long term value: 1) expanding access to health 2) developing and rewarding a diverse, inclusive and healthy workforce 3) protecting the environment and 4) operating with the highest standards of ethics and values.

Two years ago, we set a goal to enable 100 million more people to access our innovative portfolio globally, through access strategies, solutions and partnerships, by 2025.

As a result, we increased our ambition and more than tripled our original goal.

We now aim to enable 350 million more people to access our innovative portfolio by 2025.

We are eager to reach more people not only now, but in the years to come.

To this end, we pursued new scientific discoveries with an investment last year of 13.5 billion in research and development.

In total, our products and pipeline seek to address 83 percent of the top 20 global burdens of diseases.

In 2022, our MECTIZAN Donation Program turned 35 years old.

The longest running disease specific drug donation program of its kind, this successful effort to combat river blindness and lymphatic filariasis reached nearly 360 million people last year.

We also invested 38 million to advance health equity through initiatives like Merck for Mothers.

These investments support our goal to reach over 30 million people in low and middle income countries (LMICs) and in U.S. underserved populations with our social investments, by 2025.

Our new goal is to reach over 50 million people in LMICs, underserved populations in the U.S. and, going forward, underserved populations in other high income countries, by 2025.

We are committed to investing in our colleagues and building a strong pipeline of talent as an employer of choice.

Across our organization, we value diversity and inclusion as both an ethical and business priority.

Merck Impact Report 2022 2023 four year college degrees.

In order to create more access to meaningful career opportunities for diverse candidates, we posted about 900 job openings not requiring a four year degree, which was twice as many as the previous year.

In addition, in 2022 we hosted 90 student interns through Year Up, a nonprofit serving economically disadvantaged young people.

Women represented more than half of our new hires globally, and in the United States, 47 percent of new hires came from underrepresented ethnic groups.

We have a longstanding commitment to fair and equitable pay for all employees doing similar work.

In the U.S., our 2022 study found that we had achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for female and male employees, as well as non white (including Black, Hispanic and Asian employees) and white employees.

Our commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends to our business partners.

Last year, we spent 3.2 billion with diverse Tier 1 and 2 suppliers globally.

Our Company has a long history of environmental stewardship, and we believe a healthy planet is essential to improving health and protecting the sustainability of our business.

As part of this work, we have committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to set a net zero target for our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our global operations (Scopes 1, 2, 3).

We know that each of our research, production and office facilities plays a role in achieving our goals for energy efficiency, waste reduction and overall sustainability.

In 2022, we created a Waste Diversion Playbook to help sites contribute to our goals through local waste diversion strategies, such as composting and recycling, and environmentally responsible procurement practices.

We operate responsibly every day, holding ourselves to the highest standards of ethics and values.

Our code of conduct defines our corporate character and helps us protect our reputation as a trustworthy company.

We maintain 100 percent compliance to regulatory requirements for active incident monitoring, risk and harm analysis, and timely notification of data breaches.

We also encourage employees to speak up and report potential concerns, ensuring our ethics and values are reflected in all we do.

As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), Merck remains committed to improving our communities through our operations, aligning our efforts with the Ten Principles of the UNGC.

In late 2021, we announced the issuance of our first 1 billion sustainability bond to support initiatives and partnerships contributing to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Through June 2022, we allocated 760 million of the net proceeds toward social and green projects, in alignment with our sustainability financing framework.

While my colleagues and I are pleased by our 2022 progress, we remain committed to doing more to advance and protect the health of our employees, communities and planet.

Indeed, I want to thank our colleagues and partners for the passion and expertise brought to this work every day.

I am honored to work alongside such a talented and dedicated team.

Thank you again for your interest in our Company’s progress and performance.

We are excited for our future and the unique opportunity we have to make a difference through our research, our medicines and vaccines, and our enduring commitment to sustainable innovation and value creation.

At Merck, known as MSD outside of the U.S. and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

For more than 130 years, we have brought hope to humanity through the development of important medicines and vaccines.

We aspire to be the premier, research intensive biopharmaceutical Company in the world and today, we are at the forefront of research to deliver innovative health solutions that advance the prevention and treatment of diseases in people and animals.

We strive to foster a diverse and inclusive global workforce and operate responsibly every day to enable a safe, sustainable and healthy future for all people and communities.

We manage the Company through two operating segments, Pharmaceutical and Animal Health.

The Pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products.

Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders.

The Company sells these products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions.

Human health vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines, which are sold primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities.

The Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of veterinary pharmaceutical and vaccine products, as well as health management solutions and services, for the prevention, treatment and control of disease in all major livestock and companion animal species.

The Company also offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification, traceability and monitoring products.

Animal Health products are sold to veterinarians, distributors, animal producers, farmers and pet owners.

For more than 130 years, we've been dedicated to operating responsibly and creating value for society.

That commitment is one of our ongoing strengths and core to our business, which is why operating responsibly is part of the foundation of our Strategic Framework, denoting our commitment to enable a safe, sustainable and healthy future for people and communities.

We believe creating greater accountability for our sustainability strategy will help drive financial results and long term shareholder value.

This is why we added new measures to our 2023 Company Scorecard that link the compensation for a majority of our employees, including our executives, to certain key sustainability metrics in the areas of Access to Health and Employees.

We operate responsibly every day on behalf of society, shareholders and all our stakeholders to enable a safe, sustainable and healthy future for people and communities everywhere.

Over the past year, we challenged ourselves to innovate and make ambitious commitments within each of our focus areas.

Through collaborative partnerships and a holistic approach, we’re creating scalable solutions to major global issues.

In collaboration with key stakeholders, we work to ensure our science advances health care, and our products are accessible and affordable to those in need.

Our Company’s success is built on a culture that embraces different perspectives and values the contributions of each individual.

We recognize that our competitiveness is strengthened by a diverse, skilled and engaged workforce.

A healthy planet is essential to human health and the sustainability of our business, while also providing opportunities for product innovation and reducing cost and risk.

Our Company has a long history of environmental stewardship and compliance, and we realize that our strategy and efforts need to continuously evolve in the face of a changing climate.

We operate with the highest standards of ethics and integrity.

By putting our ethics and values at the foundation of everything we do, we create an accountable culture that betters our Company’s decision making, adaptability and reliability.

We operate responsibly every day on behalf of society, shareholders and all our stakeholders to enable a safe, sustainable and healthy future for people and communities everywhere.

There are hundreds of ESG topics a company can focus on at any given moment.

An ESG materiality assessment is the process through which our Company gathers information about the external landscape, and our internal priorities, in order to fine tune this larger list down to the most important strategic topics for our Company to address.

Understanding and prioritizing the issues that matter most to our business and stakeholders enables us to focus, act and report on them effectively and transparently.

Our ESG materiality assessment process helps us to focus on potential business risks and opportunities that influence our ability to create value.

It helps us determine where we should be prioritizing our efforts in order to maximize the benefit for our stakeholders, our Company and the world.

To learn more about our ESG materiality process, please see page 49.

The SDGs represent the international community’s plan of action for people, planet and prosperity.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for the planet and its people.

At its core are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

We believe we have an important role and a responsibility to help reduce the burden of disease and improve access to medicines and vaccines around the world.

That is why SDG 3 (Good Health and Well being) is at the heart of our business.

It also aligns with our purpose to save and improve lives.

While every SDG is essential to fostering sustainable development, we have prioritized eight goals where we believe we can have the biggest impact.

Black African Americans in the U.S. to 10%, up from 3% in 2020.

Hispanics Latinos in the U.S. to 10%, up from 5% in 2020.

Any remaining emissions will be offset with high quality offsets in 2025.

We're proud that our longstanding commitment to drive responsible actions across the business has received external recognition as we strive to manage ESG related risks and create value for our Company, society and our stakeholders.

Access to Health is core to our Company’s purpose to use the power of leading edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

We focus on discovering, developing and delivering innovative products and services that improve health and address unmet needs.

We actively work in partnership with a range of stakeholders, including multilateral organizations, NGOs, and governments to strengthen health systems, doing our part to ensure care is affordable, efficient and equitable.

Our multi prong, enterprise wide approach is anchored in our Access to Health Guiding Principles, which are embedded across our Company, with accountability for progress held at leadership levels.

These Principles include leading scientific discovery and invention of medicines and vaccines that address unmet need ensuring availability and affordability of our innovative portfolio and addressing barriers to health equity.

Our Access to Health goals reflect our commitment to deliver on these Principles for all stakeholders.

Further advance health equity by reaching 30 million people in LMICs and in U.S. underserved populations with our social investments, by 20252,3.

Reach at least 75% of countries around the world annually with our products4.

Enable 100 million more people to access our innovative portfolio globally, through access strategies, solutions and partnerships, by 20255.

In 2022, we reached more than 500 million people with our innovations across commercial channels, clinical trials, access strategies like our partnership with Gavi and UNICEF, voluntary licensing of antiviral treatments including our investigational antiviral COVID 19 medicine, and medicine and vaccine donations.

We build on our legacy of putting patients first by inventing medicines and vaccines to address unmet medical need, including for conditions with high global burden of disease.

As part of our R D strategy, we evaluate our candidates early for their potential to address significant public health concerns in underserved settings, including LMICs.

Our research pipeline, products which we currently market, and our external collaborations seek to address 83 percent of the world’s top health burdens, including some that primarily affect LMICs.

For example, our investigational vaccine for dengue fever is currently in a Phase 2 trial.

With approximately half of the world’s population, or four billion people, at risk for dengue disease, dengue is a critical public health challenge.

Annually, there are an estimated 105 million dengue infections worldwide on average, 50 60 million of those cause symptoms.

We also have a collaboration with Instituto Butantan to share data and learnings from our dengue vaccine programs.

In addition, we collaborate with academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, government entities and other biopharmaceutical companies, so we can follow the latest science and bring our medicines and vaccines to patients.

In 2022, we entered into 97 significant external licenses, collaborations, and acquisitions with a broad range of partners, from early stage science to clinical stage programs.

These collaborations are deemed significant because they involve an asset or technology with the potential to make an important enhancement to our R D capabilities or potential portfolio.

We continue our strong legacy of infectious disease research, including for those diseases with greater impact to LMICs like tuberculosis (TB), HIV and malaria.

In late 2022, Merck entered into a licensing agreement with the Bill Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute for two preclinical candidates with potential in combination regimens for treating TB, one of the top 10 causes of death in LMICs one of these compounds advanced to a Phase 1 clinical trial earlier this year.

Merck scientists discovered the compounds as part of the TB Drug Accelerator, a collaboration among biopharmaceutical companies, research organizations and universities to accelerate new TB therapies, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

HIV is a global epidemic that disproportionately affects populations in LMICs in sub Saharan Africa.

In fact, two thirds of the more than 35 million people living with HIV reside in the region, accounting for about 75 percent of HIV related deaths, globally.

Merck continues its more than 35 years of scientific research to address the HIV epidemic.

We have a broad R D program, including a Phase 3 development program for a new once daily two drug regimen and a Phase 2 study evaluating an investigational weekly oral combination treatment of our antiviral islatravir and Gilead Sciences’ lenacapavir, part of an agreement with Gilead to study long acting HIV treatments.

In addition, as part of our ongoing partnership with the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation, we recently began a Phase 1b study to evaluate potential mechanisms for an oral long acting HIV prevention option.

We continue to collaborate on new options for malaria, an infection with rising resistance to existing treatments and which remains one of the largest killers of pregnant women and children under the age of five in most resource poor countries.

A new antimalarial drug candidate, discovered through our longstanding collaboration with the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Australia and with funding from the Wellcome Trust, recently entered Phase 1 clinical testing.

We strive to discover treatments for diseases that affect people across a breadth of countries globally, such as cardiovascular disease.

Merck has a long history of developing treatments for cardiovascular disease.

More than 60 years ago, we introduced our first cardiovascular therapy and our scientific efforts to understand and treat cardiovascular related disorders have continued, including with our investigational, once daily oral proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor in adults with hypercholesterolemia.

Merck plans to start a Phase 3 pivotal study of the potential treatment in the second half of 2023.

Did you know Analysis from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation notes a growing global disease burden from chronic issues like high cholesterol.

Our R D expenditure In 2022, Merck’s R D spend was 13.5 billion, making us a leader in funding R D within the biopharmaceutical industry.

With a focus on improving adherence and enhancing the patient experience, we also strive to provide new options that increase the ease of administration.

For example, in HIV, we are researching long acting medications designed to reduce the frequency of administration.

Clinical trials play a critical role in advancing scientific innovations.

Our Company is determined to expand access to trials including through increased diversity.

In 2022, we reached more than 85,000 people through our clinical trials in more than 60 countries worldwide.

It will take a comprehensive approach to increase the diversity of participants in clinical trials, which is why we are tackling a variety of associated factors, many in partnership with other stakeholders.

Our team of clinical trial operations experts implements best practices in our studies globally.

For every late stage trial, we require plans to recruit patients that appropriately reflect the diversity of the people who will ultimately take the medicines we make.

We also prioritize placement of study sites in communities with higher populations of individuals who have historically been underrepresented in clinical trials.

In 2022, approximately 50 percent of enrollees were from underrepresented groups.

Partnerships are critical to increasing diversity in clinical trials.

In 2022, we joined the Novartis led collaboration Beacon of Hope, a 10 year program that establishes clinical trial Centers of Excellence at four Historically Black Medical Schools to increase diversity among clinical trial investigators and participants.

We are also a contributor to sponsorships to connect with, support and train more clinicians from underrepresented groups.

To ease logistical barriers that make it difficult for some patients to visit clinical trial sites, we’re working with Greenphire, a provider of global financial lifecycle management solutions for clinical trials.

The organization’s ClinCard debit card provides direct stipends and travel reimbursement.

In addition, we have developed tools to reach study participants within their communities, including through local pharmacies and mobile study sites.

For more information, please see the Discovery Invention section in GRI 203 on pages 54 57.

At Merck, we believe scientific innovation fuels long term value to society.

And to make those innovations as impactful as possible, we must also focus on strong commercialization, quality manufacturing, and operational excellence in our global supply distribution, while reducing our environmental impact.

Our goal to reach at least 75 percent of countries in the world annually with our medicines and vaccines demonstrates our commitment to global product availability.

In 2022, we surpassed our goal for the second consecutive year, reaching 76 percent of countries around the world with our products.

Through our manufacturing and supply division, we strive to maintain a reliable global supply network of the highest quality.

Our supply chain is designed to operate a lean and efficient network that produces our medicines and vaccines to the highest quality, safety and environmental standards, in full compliance with regulations and current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs), as well as industry best practices.

Through digitally enabled end to end supply planning, we are modernizing our manufacturing operations and conducting efficient and balanced planning to maximize business results and deliver medicines and vaccines to customers, when and where they need them.

Our facilities, along with our external suppliers and partners, make up an integrated, interdependent global manufacturing network.

From digital upgrades to blockchain technology, integrated access planning early in the product development cycle and planning for new manufacturing models, we are evolving systems to ensure broad availability of our medicines and vaccines to better meet patient needs.

In the last few years, countries have introduced new or expanded routine vaccination programs, creating unprecedented increases in the global demand for vaccines.

To meet this demand, we have increased our capacity and supply capability across our vaccines portfolio and are committed to continuing to do so.

For more information, please see the Availability section in GRI 203 on pages 58 63.

We can never rest until a way has been found to bring our finest achievements to everyone.

Our purpose to deliver medicines and vaccines to save and improve lives is not fulfilled if our inventions cannot reach the people who most need them.

It’s why we are committed to helping shape the health care ecosystem, ensuring people are empowered with the options to pursue high quality, affordable medicines and vaccines, in a sustainable way.

In 2021, we set a goal to use strategies, solutions and partnerships to enable 100 million more people to access our innovative portfolio globally by 2025.5 In 2022, we were proud to exceed this goal, having enabled access for more than 189 million people.

This is why we are taking our goal further, increasing it to 350 million people by 2025.

Merck Impact Report 2022 2023 In addition, we are committed to engaging with global health organizations to improve the resilience of immunization programs and to advance equitable access to our vaccines, especially in LMICs. For example, through our long term commitment to Gavi and UNICEF, we broaden access to our vaccines to help prevent HPV related cancers and diseases in Gavi supported countries by providing them at an accessible price.

Access planning is a key part of our research and development process.

One example is our global, multi faceted strategy to facilitate timely and equitable access to our investigational antiviral COVID 19 medicine.

This strategy was particularly important in the face of the global COVID 19 pandemic.

Our strategy includes advance purchase and supply agreements with more than 40 countries and voluntary license agreements with Indian generic manufacturers and the Medicines Patent Pool, enabling availability of generic versions of our investigational antiviral COVID 19 medicine to more than 100 LMICs. In addition, we allocated up to three million courses of therapy to UNICEF for LMICs as a bridge strategy until the voluntary licensees were able to produce supply.

Thanks to this strategy, more than five million courses of our investigational antiviral COVID 19 medicine have been delivered to over 20 LMICs through 2022.

In addition, Merck’s direct supply has treated more than four million patients worldwide through 2022.

For more information, please see the Affordability section in GRI 203 on pages 64 69.

To advance our goal of enabling more people to access our innovative portfolio, we are focusing on building health care capacity, strengthening channels for care delivery and fostering sustainable financing.

In building health care capacity, we help to create greater efficiency for patients in the health care system through collaborations with hospitals and health care networks.

For example, we work with partners using a data based approach to understand how a patient’s cancer journey can be optimized from earlier diagnosis through to treatment.

We also collaborate with different financial institutions and payers, supporting them to expand funding options that help patients and their families cope with potentially high out of pocket costs caused by critical illness.

Through collaborations that reach underserved populations, we are working with health care providers and others in the digital health and financial sectors to develop solutions that enhance disease awareness and health care access.

When market based solutions are inadequate or unavailable, we pursue programs to provide direct access to our medicines and vaccines, including through product donations.

One donation program we’re particularly proud of is our longstanding MECTIZAN Donation Program (MDP).

For more than 35 years, the MDP has donated our medicine MECTIZAN for the treatment of onchocerciasis (known as river blindness) and, for more than 25 years, also for the treatment of lymphatic filaraisis.

MDP is the longest running disease specific drug donation program and partnership of its kind and is widely regarded as one of the most successful public private health collaborations in the world.

Our Merck Medical Outreach Program (MMOP) is the primary way we donate our medicines and vaccines for global disaster relief and humanitarian assistance in LMICs. In 2022, we reached more than 118,000 people through the MMOP.

For more information on our product donations, please see GRI 203 on pages 69 72 for more information.

Maternal health outcomes can serve to shine a light on the strength of a health system.

In many countries, inequitable maternal health outcomes persist despite having preventable causes.

Merck for Mothers is our 650 million global initiative to create a world where no woman has to die while giving life.

For more than a decade, the program has brought Merck’s scientific and business expertise to help make maternal health outcomes more equitable and pregnancy and childbirth safer.

For more information, please visit the Merck for Mothers website.

To save and improve lives with our medicines and vaccines, we recognize we have a role to play to help advance global health, and to reduce barriers for underserved populations so that all patients have access to high quality health care.

Our focus on health equity aligns to our deepest held Company values.

In 2022, we invested 38 million in social investments to address health equity.

Our social investments help advance health equity around the world by addressing the barriers that many individuals face in seeking and receiving high quality health care.

We provide support in several ways, including through key initiatives like Merck for Mothers, health equity initiatives, and our impact investments.

Our Foundation is funded entirely by our Company and is our chief source of financial support for qualified, eligible nonprofit organizations whose programs align with our philanthropic priorities.

In 2021, we set a goal to reach 30 million people with social investments for health equity in LMICs and underserved populations in the U.S.

Through 2022, we exceeded this goal, reaching more than 33 million people, including more than 18 million in 2022 alone.

To drive continued action, we have increased this health equity goal to now reach 50 million people by 2025.

We’re now including underserved populations in high income countries beyond the U.S. in this goal as our health equity investments evolve to meet the needs of underserved populations everywhere.

Our social investments support multiple programs and partnerships to advance more equitable cancer treatment.

In the U.S., we have supported the American Cancer Society’s Get Screened Initiative aimed at reducing disparities in cancer screening.

These disparities have been exacerbated by the COVID 19 pandemic.

Also, through the CEO Roundtable on Cancer, we support Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions in improving health equity, education, and access in communities disproportionately affected by cancer.

In addition, through a nearly 2 million grant from our Foundation, we support the American Cancer Society in establishing patient navigation programs in resource limited settings in sub Saharan Africa.

The output includes a toolkit that can help other countries adopt similar programs.

Another way we advance health equity is through impact investments, which deploy financial resources to generate improved health care access all while growing a sustainable global health ecosystem and attracting additional capital and partners.

For example, we invest in Mamotest, a company in Latin America providing AI enabled telediagnosis for breast cancer.

Learn more about our impact investments on our corporate site, as well as in GRI 201 1 on page 51.

In 2022, we launched a 1 million Health Equity Catalyst Fund for employees to empower our teams to develop solutions that promote equitable health outcomes, particularly for underserved populations.

The fund currently supports 15 community level efforts, initiated by employees, in 13 countries.

In 2022, we built on the success of our Alliance to Advance Patient Centered Cancer Care with a new U.S. based initiative the Alliance for Equity in Cancer Care.

Over the next five years, this 20 million commitment from our Foundation will address persistent disparities across the cancer care continuum and improve the delivery of equitable, culturally responsive care in underserved communities in the U.S.

For more information on our cancer care initiatives, see GRI 203 on page 74. business strategies, and track our progress in reducing barriers to access.

These efforts serve as a mechanism to engage our employees in innovative thinking that reduces inequities, advances our goals and extends our corporate purpose to save and improve lives.

For more information, please see the Strengthening health systems and addressing inequity section on pages 73 76.

Our best in class talent share in our purpose to save and improve lives.

We have demonstrated progress against our baseline diversity measures.

We’re delivering on our commitments overall, as well as addressing annual fluctuations in senior management (vice president senior vice president) representation to ensure we’re well positioned to meet our multi year targets.

Along the way, we are building a strong pipeline of talent: globally, 52 percent of new hires in 2022 were women and in the U.S., 47 percent were members of underrepresented groups.

We aid our employees’ growth through broad leadership development programs as well as through affinity based initiatives that consider our colleagues' unique backgrounds.

One of the primary ways we attract and retain the best talent is through training and development.

By investing in our employees, we also invest in their ability to deliver innovative medicines and vaccines for patients.

Our leadership development programs cut across all levels, divisions and geographies of the Company.

Some focus on business acumen, others on creating positive change.

For example, our General Management Acceleration Program is an application based, early talent development initiative that grows participants’ business and financial acumen as well as their critical thinking abilities.

Our affinity based development programs for female, LGBTQ , Hispanic Latino, and Black colleagues build a sense of community and aim to increase the number of diverse leaders ready to progress in their careers while furthering leadership capabilities and business acumen.

Enhancing diversity in Merck’s employee population betters our understanding of our customers, promotes the inclusion of diverse populations in our clinical trials, and encourages the innovation that drives our business.

Put simply, diversity and inclusion is a business imperative.

Our GD I strategy also supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to advance gender equality, provide fulfilling work and economic growth, reduce inequalities within and among countries, and strengthen our global partnerships.

Our enterprise wide strategy demonstrates our commitment to diversity and inclusion as a business priority.

It is endorsed at the highest levels of the organization, including by the CEO and Executive Team.

Our Board of Directors also has a diversity policy.

We also have collaborative, cross functional teams who integrate diversity and inclusion (D I) capabilities into our operations, and employees are encouraged to link their annual priorities to D I.

Our 10 Employee Business Resource Groups (EBRGs) include almost 20,000 members.

For more than 50 years, we have built communities within our Company that foster retention, facilitate growth, provide mentorship and strengthen networks.

They also make direct contributions to our business strategy with culturally relevant insights that drive our success and improve our decision making.

We have had a longstanding commitment to fair and equitable pay for all employees doing similar work.

In 2022, our pay equity study achieved nearly worldwide coverage, encompassing approximately 90 percent of our global employee population, or nearly 60,000 employees.

In the U.S., our study showed that we have achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for female and male employees, and that we have achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for non white (including Black, Hispanic and Asian employees) and white employees.

Read more about our efforts toward pay equity in GRI 405 on page 134.

Did you know In 2021, we created a global digital accessibility policy to ensure equal access across our digital landscape, for stakeholders both internally and externally.

In 2022, we strengthened our support for digital accessibility with a five year roadmap to ensure we have a universal design standard for our facilities around the world.

These guidelines reflect designing for accessibility, usability and inclusion, and go beyond the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Merck Impact Report 2022 2023 For the third year in a row, we were proud recipients of the Peter J. Dunn Award for Green Chemistry and Engineering Impact, an award given by the American Chemical Society in recognition of outstanding implementation of novel green chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry.

The team earning this 2022 award reduced an 11 step synthesis for a product to just two steps, replacing toxic solvents with biorenewable ones.

Did you know Since the establishment of the Green Chemistry Challenge Awards by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the American Chemistry Society (ACS) in 1996, we have been recognized with nine Green Chemistry Awards for innovative process improvements, with six of those consecutively since 2017.

Our local sites are crucial to achieving our ambitious environmental sustainability goals, and we continue to launch tools to assist them, particularly for our climate and waste targets.

In 2021, we launched our Low Carbon Transition Playbook (LCTP), a common platform that includes a gap assessment to help our global sites evaluate the maturity of their energy programs and help create short and long term plans to reduce sites' carbon intensity and build toward a low carbon future.

Based on learnings from use, LCTP 2.0 was issued in 2022 with a capability to facilitate knowledge sharing across sites.

Thanks to the success of the LCTP, we took a similar approach for waste diversion.

In 2022, we created the Waste Diversion Playbook to guide sites on developing a roadmap to our shared 2025 goals, including local waste diversion strategies and environmentally responsible procurement practices.

These tools aid in the reporting and tracking of projects that support achievements towards meeting our corporate targets.

Meeting our environmental sustainability goals is intrinsically linked to the creation of innovative, cost efficient manufacturing processes with low environmental impact.

We see transformative science engineering and innovation as critical enablers to developing sustainable, low cost manufacturing processes that provide environmental and economic benefits over the life cycle of our products.

Our aim is to develop the most efficient and sustainable processes at product launch, with the goal of minimizing material use and waste from our commercial manufacturing.

Our Company utilizes an innovative green by design development strategy to progress from an initial early clinical supply route to a fully optimized and sustainable commercial manufacturing process.

We continuously evaluate our sites’ waste disposal methods to gain a better understanding of our network and changes therein, as well as to identify risks and opportunities in our value chain.

Based on our evaluation, we implemented programs resulting in diversion of 60 percent of landfill waste from our highest landfill generating sites.

We are currently meeting our 2025 public waste diversion goal with 16 percent of total operational waste being sent to landfill or incineration without energy recovery, and we will continue to strive to improve our waste minimization, recycling and diversion efforts.

Access to clean water is critical for human health.

As water is a key input to our manufacturing operations, we assess water risk throughout our network as a standard business practice.

Both of our priority water stress risk sites have conservation plans in place and are actively working on water use reduction and recycling improvement projects.

In 2022, we achieved a 17 percent reduction in our water use compared to our 2015 baseline.

This reduction is consistent with our ongoing commitment to achieving our stated target: by 2025, we will maintain global water use at or below 2015 levels.

Our sites are employing various technologies and techniques aimed at reducing our water footprint and improving operational performance.

Our continued endorsement of the UN CEO Water Mandate enables continued alignment of our water program with its principles directly in our operations.

We continued to identify partnerships that will help us advance our water stewardship priorities in the areas in which we operate.

Our stakeholders trust us to do the right thing, and it is imperative we uphold that trust.

That means operating responsibly to enable a safe, sustainable and healthy future for people and communities everywhere, and to always put patients first.

Our strong commitment to ethics and integrity is the bedrock of our Company and enables us to fulfill our purpose.

Our policies and procedures reinforce that commitment, from how we conduct research and development, to the management of our supply chain, to available and affordable products.

Employees and suppliers can anonymously (where permitted by law) raise concerns or ask questions at MSDethics.com.

The reporting tool is available via phone or online, and in employees’ preferred languages.

In 2019, we introduced an industry leading program to build trust between employees and management and to promote our speak up culture through the use of listening circles facilitated by regional ethics officers.

Today, the Ethics and Integrity Culture Building Assessment and Listening Program continues to empower employees to share their views on the Company's speak up culture.

Managers gain perspective on the strengths and opportunities for their teams' cultures, and action plans help to address what’s learned.

In 2022, the program was rolled out in two markets, Japan and Brazil.

It is expanding to additional markets in 2023 as we continue to invest in our ethical culture and our people.

The Company’s integrity extends to our political giving, where we carefully make bipartisan contributions on a case by case basis in support of policies that enhance innovation and patient access to health care.

For the last six years, the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School's Center for Political Accountability at the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics and Research has named us a Trendsetter in their annual CPA Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability report, demonstrating our commitment to transparency around our political giving.

Our respect for human rights extends to our suppliers, all of whom must follow our Business Partner Code of Conduct.

We are also committed to the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) Principles.

In addition, to manage potential risks associated with third party business relationships, our Global Supplier Management Group (GSMG) uses a third party risk management committee and program to evaluate risks for Labor and Human Rights (LHR) in our supply chain.

Our sourcing professionals also receive appropriate training on evaluating partners for these risks.

We investigate any concerns quickly, and regularly conduct due diligence on our suppliers, including audits to verify they uphold LHR standards.

Where we find issues, they are held accountable for addressing them.

We also ask suppliers to support initiatives like the PSCI Human Rights.

All of our contributions can be found on the Transparency Disclosures page of our corporate website.

Donations include people reached with products through the MECTIZAN Donation Program, U.S.

Patient Assistance Programs, and the Merck Medical Outreach Program.

Sources of data are Merck Co., Inc. and third party data sets that are tracked within an enterprise wide internal database.

The people reached metric for all sources is calculated as doses sold divided by the average dose schedule for a given market in a given year.

People taking multiple products may be counted as multiple people towards the total estimate.

In some instances, this estimate may include people enabled to access our products through access strategies, solutions and partnerships, which are calculated as part of our goal to enable access to our innovative portfolio (page 10).

The people reached metric does not include people reached through social investments, which are calculated as part of our goal to further advance health equity for underserved populations (page 10).

Underserved populations are defined as those that face health disparities due to disadvantages related to insurance status, social determinants of health, race, ethnicity, gender identity sexual orientation, age and or language preference.

The goal is cumulative across the reporting period of 2021 2025, and is independent of a baseline period.

In some cases, third party reports may include cumulative people reached for the reporting period, and or data that is attributable to other partners as well as our Company's philanthropic investment.

Innovative portfolio of products refers to our Company’s on patent products.

Enable more people is defined as implemented and launched in market and will be in comparison to the baseline (2020) as of 2025.

Evidence for metrics are sourced from the best publicly available data and proxy sources by market.

While proxies differ by market, all methodologies are evaluated and represent the best estimate of people enabled to access our innovative portfolio through access strategies, solutions and partnerships (see page 19 for additional information).

People who were enabled to access innovative medicines and vaccines did not necessarily receive such innovative medicines and vaccines.

Our Company is committed to the highest ethical standards to help maximize the long term sustainability of our business, and of the communities in which we operate.

We strive to conduct business with third parties that share our commitment to high ethical standards and operate in a responsible and ethical manner.

The term third party is broadly interpreted to include any individual or entity that provides any type of goods or services in support of our sourcing initiatives.

We expect all third parties with whom we engage to comply with all applicable regulations, as well as share in our commitment to the principles outlined in our Business Partner Code of Conduct.

We manufacture, package and distribute products to many markets around the world.

We have established business relationships with thousands of suppliers, including direct suppliers (including external manufacturing providers), capital expenditure suppliers, indirect suppliers and research providers.

Our direct suppliers provide us with goods such as packaging, components and ingredients.

Capital expenditure suppliers provide goods and services such as engineering and construction.

Our indirect suppliers include those that provide services such as logistics, travel and meetings, facility management, and marketing.

Our research providers include lab supplies and other research and development related services.

We have a sourcing management process in which environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and economic inclusion and supplier diversity principles are integrated in each stage.

Throughout the supplier life cycle, our Company establishes expectations, assesses risk, supports supplier development and manages performance.

Our Global Supplier Management Group (GSMG) is responsible for driving our Sustainable Sourcing program and maintaining the associated standards and processes by which suppliers are identified, qualified and managed.

Integration into our Global Sourcing Procurement Strategy and processes.

A cross functional team that oversees program development and the processes and guidelines to encourage best practices, prevent violations of supply chain standards and limit risk.

Established sustainability requirements that are communicated to our suppliers and included in supplier selection.

Review, tracking and communication of supplier sustainability programs.

Collaboration as we educate and learn from our supply chain, peer companies and best in class organizations.

To help manage and address potential areas of risk associated with third party business relationships, we have an established Third Party Risk Management program and committee chaired by the senior vice president for Global Procurement.

The committee establishes, implements and monitors environmentally sustainable, socially responsible and ethical sourcing practices to ensure that performance is aligned with our purpose.

In 2022, cross functional leaders sponsored an enterprise wide program to streamline our third party due diligence process, leveraging one IT platform to launch assessments, and to review and mitigate risks from Compliance, Global Safety and the Environment, Information Technology Risk Management Security, Pharmacovigilance and Global Security.

We select suppliers that share our commitment to our values and principles.

We expect appropriate standards of conduct and respect for human rights from our suppliers, contractors, vendors and external partners, consistent with our own.

We use our Business Partner Code of Conduct to communicate our expectations for Human Rights, Labor Employment, Health, Safety Environment, and Ethical Business Practices.

Our Business Partner Code of Conduct, along with our Supplier Performance Expectations, are communicated to existing and potential third parties.

They are included in requests for information, proposals and quotes, as well as in our purchase order terms and conditions.

We make our Business Partner Code of Conduct available in 26 languages.

Our Business Partner Code of Conduct references the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management (the Principles).

PSCI is a group of more than 50 pharmaceutical and health care companies which promotes sustainable sourcing and better business conditions across the industry, and the Principles set the standard for human rights, ethics, labor, health and safety, environment and related management systems.

The member companies share a vision of better social, health, safety and environmental outcomes in the communities where we buy.

We have a defined risk management process, and our supply base is measured against the process criteria.

Using a risk based approach, supplier assessments and audits are conducted based on multiple factors (e.g., risk profile, engagement and activity type, geography).

The assessments and audits evaluate a supplier’s ability to meet both industry and our own standards for quality, safety and ethical business practices.

Results are reviewed with senior management across the Company.

Some of our suppliers, such as contract research organizations, market research agencies, information technology systems developers, corporate card suppliers, and travel and meeting agencies process personal information in connection with their performance of services for our Company.

We require these suppliers to provide appropriate privacy protection for personal information that they handle in accordance with our privacy policies and applicable privacy laws, regulations and guidelines.

See more about our privacy program in GRI 418 on page 156.

We understand the importance of training, and continue to develop numerous training events that are assigned to employees and provided to industry peers and suppliers.

Most of our internal classes are assigned through our centralized learning system.

In addition to providing training through our internal systems, we also work with PSCI to develop and provide training to our suppliers and peers.

Additional details regarding our supplier focused programs can be found in.

GRI 204 on page 77, GRI 308 on page 112 and GRI 414 on page 145.

Where assessments and audits identify deficiencies or opportunities for improvement, we monitor suppliers to ensure that our concerns are addressed in a responsible and compliant manner.

As part of our oversight and monitoring, we have established mechanisms to report, track and monitor supplier plans to address nonconformance and help drive continued improvement.

Additional review(s) are performed for external manufacturing suppliers and suppliers that manage personal and private information.

During 2022, we reviewed the following metrics to help us assess the effectiveness of our efforts in our business and supply chain.

We use these measures to monitor our performance and identify opportunities to help improve our programs.

Prior to 2020, informal training was provided on an as needed basis.

Decrease in number of assessments was due to the change in criteria in late 2020 for when a Supplier Self Assessment is required using a risk based approach.

All CAPAs from previous reporting periods have been closed.

Third party contractors include the Company’s temporary workers, independent contractors and freelancers who are viewed as full time equivalent employees.

The PEC, under the guidance of the Executive Team, serves to ensure the Company is advancing its strategic framework through public policy and sustainability efforts that proactively shape and respond to the changing landscape in which the business operates.

This group of cross functional senior leaders recommends positions for decision to the Executive Team on critical public policy and sustainability issues, and monitors related performance across regions and functions and resources allocated to meet goals and objectives.

With guidance from the PEC, the ESMT advises, shapes and drives the Company’s long term sustainability strategy, including providing recommendations regarding risks and opportunities to the Company.

The role of ESMT is to create long term value, differentiate our Company as a leader in sustainability, and answer to stakeholder demands about key issues across our four focus areas: Access to Health, Employees, Environmental Sustainability, and Ethics Values.

The ESMT works to ensure that our sustainability strategy and priorities are aligned with and support our corporate strategic framework, in order to meet the Company’s public commitments and expectations of our stakeholders.

Our 2023 proxy statement (pages 8 14, 18 26, 32 39, and 112) includes information on our Board nomination process and the Board's roles and responsibilities for the management of and reporting on sustainability topics at the Company.

We are committed to governance policies and practices that serve the interests of the Company and its shareholders.

Our governance structure is an integral part of this commitment.

Our Executive Team (ET) and senior management are responsible for reviewing, refining and implementing our Company’s long term sustainability strategy.

Through groups such as the Policy and ESG Council, senior leaders from across the Company direct the day to day supervision of our efforts supporting this strategy.

Our ET updates the Board on our long term sustainability strategy and performance as part of the Board’s annual strategic planning meeting.

Discussions and updates also occur at the Board and its Committees on specific topics.

For example, the Board's Governance Committee, which monitors and assists the Board in its oversight of sustainability matters, ensures that relevant issues are subject to review by Board committees with relevant areas of competency.

The team is responsible for raising the visibility of sustainability issues and activities across the Company, and fostering connections across business units and functional areas to assist with the integration of sustainability principles into business policies, strategies and practices.

This includes producing the Company's annual Impact Report.

We take a precautionary approach when evaluating potential human exposures and environmental impacts resulting from our manufacturing processes.

Conservative assumptions are made when data is limited, and safety factors are added to address uncertainty and variability in our assessments.

This type of approach is particularly relevant to our work in toxicology, industrial hygiene, biosafety and environmental protection.

Our Company’s Office of Ethics is responsible for ensuring that employees are aware of and trained on the Code of Conduct and corporate policies addressing ethics and compliance.

Our Code of Conduct is available in 21 languages and applies to all employees worldwide.

Corporate policies are reviewed every three years by business content owners and updated as needed.

We abide by strict ethical standards in our own operations and, to the extent possible, we insist on equivalent standards from our suppliers.

Our Business Partner Code of Conduct reflects similar and consistent principles for our business partners.

The Office of Ethics also serves as a channel for the receipt, triaging and redress of ethics and compliance related concerns.

Depending on the concern type, the concerns will be investigated by the Office of Ethics, the Office of General Counsel, Global Security or Human Resources.

Employees are encouraged, prepared and empowered to raise their concerns to their management, Human Resources, Legal, Compliance or the Office of Ethics.

The Office of Ethics maintains a global Speak Up program and the MSDethics.com reporting tool.

The reporting tool is operated by an independent third party and is available 24 7.

MSDethics.com allows employees and suppliers to raise concerns or ask questions confidentially and anonymously (where permitted by law) in their preferred language via phone or online.

The Company communicates regularly with employees to encourage and foster a Speak Up culture and ensure that they understand how they can report potential misconduct or concerns.

In alignment with our priority to protect and enhance our Company’s reputation through safe, ethical and compliant behaviors, and to foster a strong culture of ethics and compliance, regional ethics officers manage a network of site based volunteer ethics ambassadors outside of the U.S.

These ethics ambassadors are trained to answer employee questions about the Company’s reporting and investigation process and actively support the Speak Up program.

We maintain a fulsome process for escalation and investigation of potential compliance related concerns.

The process is designed to ensure that we promptly and discreetly investigate all reports of conduct and or behavior that could violate our policies, values or standards.

If allegations of misconduct are substantiated, appropriate remediation and disciplinary actions are taken to ensure that those who were responsible are held accountable and recurrence is prevented.

Disciplinary actions can include, but are not limited to, dismissal from the Company, issuance of final written warning letters and or financial penalties.

In addition, we take appropriate steps to address any needed improvements in organizational and process controls.

We report all forms of EHS compliance notices using the term Notices of Violation (NOVs), which includes citations, letters of warning and notices of noncompliance from environmental and safety focused regulatory agencies.

In 2022, we had 196 EHS related regulatory agency inspections of our facilities around the world.

We received 3 safety related and 11 environmental related NOVs, and paid 6,693 in fines in 2022.

None of the environmental related NOVs were the result of a significant spill.

Subject to local law, the Company also has the discretion to reduce incentive payments made to employees in certain instances of misconduct.

This may apply when employees engage in misconduct that results in a material policy violation.

Retaliation against employees who report concerns is a violation of corporate policy and is strictly prohibited.

The Office of Ethics and the Office of General Counsel are responsible for overseeing investigations into potential ethics and compliance concerns to ensure consistent and timely resolution of potential concerns and implementation of remediation actions.

Please visit our corporate website for more information on our Code of Conduct.

As an example of an industry leading best practice, our Company developed the Ethics and Integrity Culture Building Assessment and Listening Program which aims to build and sustain trust between employees and management and to promote and enhance our Speak Up culture.

In 2022, we brought the program to two markets: Japan, across all divisions and Brazil, where we focused on an Animal Health manufacturing plant.

In both markets, our regional ethics officers partnered with local teams to facilitate a series of listening sessions with management and employees.

During the sessions, employees were empowered to share their views on the Company's culture with respect to speaking up and listening up.

At the same time, managers were able to gain valuable insights into the strengths and areas of opportunity for their own teams' cultures.

After the listening sessions were completed, leaders implemented action plans to further strengthen their organization's Speak Up culture.

This program supports the Company’s priority to Invest in the growth, success and well being of its people.

It also reflects a commitment to two of the Company's Ways of Working: Speak up and be open minded and Embrace diversity and inclusion.

The program aligns with our sustainability goals by helping to build diverse and inclusive team cultures while enhancing employee engagement.

For more information regarding compliance related matters, please see GRI 416 on pages 148 153.

Our Company is a member of numerous U.S. based industry and trade groups.

We work with these groups because they represent the pharmaceutical industry and business community in debates led by governments and other stakeholders, and because they help the industry reach consensus on policy issues.

Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).

When our trade associations actively lobby on our core business issues, we seek to align their positions with our own.

There are times, however, when we may not share the views of our peers or associations both on issues that are central to our business and on those that, while important, are not directly material to our purpose.

With representatives on the boards and committees of industry groups and trade associations, we can voice questions or concerns we may have about policy or related activities.

We may even recuse ourselves from related trade association or industry group activities when appropriate.

The Governance Committee of the Board of Directors has ongoing oversight of our membership in trade associations and grassroots lobbying activities.

Each year, the full Board of Directors receives a report that lists for the previous year (a) the U.S. industry and trade groups in which we are a member for which our dues are greater than 25,000 and (b) the amount of our dues that were spent by these groups on lobbying and political activity in the U.S.

Please see the Transparency Disclosures page on our corporate website for a list of our U.S. industry and trade groups.

In 2022, we conducted a climate policy alignment assessment of U.S. trade associations in which we were a member in 2021 and for which our dues were greater than 25,000.

For this assessment, we determined whether these trade associations had publicly disclosed formal positions on climate change and, if so, we reviewed those positions in the context of our Company's own position on climate change.

This assessment can be found on the Sustainability Resources page on our corporate website.

Information on our approach to climate change, and related performance data, can be.

Throughout the year, we regularly engage with our shareholders and seek to better understand their perspectives.

We have established a proactive shareholder engagement program, in which members of Investor Relations, the Office of the Secretary, Human Resources and the ESG Strategy Engagement Team, as well as other subject matter experts within the Company, engage with our shareholders to remain well informed regarding their perspectives on current issues and to address any questions or concerns.

These teams serve as liaisons between shareholders, members of senior management and the Board.

In addition, we conduct an extensive shareholder outreach program twice a year focused on governance, executive compensation and sustainability matters.

We believe it is most productive to discuss these matters well in advance of the annual meeting.

This enables management and the Board to gather information about investor perspectives and make educated and deliberate decisions that are balanced and appropriate for our diverse shareholder base and in the Company’s best interests.

In 2022, we hosted a virtual investor event with our CEO and other members of his Executive Team to discuss our Company’s sustainability priorities and goals, and how our sustainability strategy is fundamental to our long term business value and success.

A webcast of this event is available on our corporate website.

Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

These risks can be either acute (short term) or chronic (long term).

The adverse impacts of climate change include increased frequency and severity of natural disasters and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornados, wildfires (exacerbated by drought), flooding and extreme heat.

Extreme weather and sea level rise pose physical risks to our facilities as well as those of our suppliers.

Such risks include losses incurred as a result of physical damage to facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by such natural disasters and extreme weather events.

Other potential physical impacts due to climate change include reduced access to high quality water in certain regions and the loss of biodiversity, which could impact future product development.

These risks could disrupt our operations and our supply chain, which may result in increased costs.

New legal or regulatory requirements may be enacted to prevent, mitigate or adapt to the implications of a changing climate and its effects on the environment.

These regulations, which may differ across jurisdictions, could result in our Company being subject to new or expanded carbon pricing or taxes, increased compliance costs, restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, investment in new technologies, increased carbon disclosure and transparency, upgrade of facilities to meet new building codes, and the redesign of utility systems which could increase our operating costs, including the cost of electricity and energy we use.

Our supply chain would likely be subject to these same transitional risks and would likely look to pass along any increased costs to our Company, all of which may affect our ability to procure raw materials or other supplies at the quantities and levels required for the operation of our business.

While we understand the potential risks to our Company, there is limited data around the potential financial implications of these risks.

In 2022, we continued performing a Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) gap analysis.

This included a high level TCFD aligned qualitative physical and transitional climate risk and opportunity scenario assessment to examine which parts of our business are at highest risk due to climate change, and the associated costs.

These potential risks are integrated into our business planning, including investment in reducing energy usage, water use and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).

We have made it a priority to reduce our demand for energy, and have established internal policies and practices focused on reducing energy use at our sites and minimizing GHG generation throughout the Company.

By taking these steps, we are not only minimizing GHG emissions but also reducing operating costs and mitigating the business impacts expected to be associated with future climate change requirements.

Our Sustainability Capital Fund is used exclusively for environmental sustainability projects that bring long term value to the Company, focusing on carbon footprint, water use and solid waste reduction at our sites around the world.

The fund allocates up to 12 million per year, which allows us to adopt low carbon technology, better positions us to respond to climate change and supports a more circular economy.1 Since 2015, our sites have completed more than 159 projects through the Sustainability Capital Fund, which has avoided the production of an estimated 57,100 metric tons of carbon emissions per year.

Worldwide, we offer core and ancillary financial security and retirement benefits that routinely rank among the most valuable and progressive of other large multinational corporations.

Outside the U.S., we have more than 80 pension plans (including defined benefit, cash balance and defined contribution plans) in over 40 countries.

These plans often supplement government sponsored social security pension benefits to improve employees’ financial security through added retirement income.

Management does not believe that expenditures related to our environmental sustainability initiatives should have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources for any year.

For more information, please see GRI 305 on page 101.

Our CDP Climate Change Questionnaire is available on CDP’s website, which CDP has aligned to the TCFD reporting recommendations.

In the U.S., we offer a defined benefit pension plan as well as a 401(k) plan with matching contributions.

The average employee contribution rate of pay into the 401(k) plan is approximately 10 percent.

Approximately 97 percent of U.S. based employees participate in the 401(k) plan, and 100 percent participate in the pension plan.

Additionally, U.S. based employees who are at least age 55 and those who have at least 10 years of service after age 40 are eligible for subsidized medical benefits at retirement.

Benefits vary based on region and country, employee group and status, collective bargaining agreements and local legal requirements.

For information on our other benefits, please see our Well being Report on our corporate website.

For more than a century, we have been inventing medicines and vaccines for many of the world’s most challenging diseases.

We are committed to addressing unmet medical needs through innovative research and development (R D).

Our R D expenses of 13.5 billion in 2022 reflected robust clinical development spending as well as increased investment in discovery research and early drug development from 2021.

As defined by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) visualization tools developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), the diseases that our products address rank high on the list of worldwide causes of illness, disability, and death.

Our research into vaccines and infectious diseases seeks to address major burdens of disease that are prevalent in all countries.

We believe that the resulting vaccines and treatments can have the greatest impact in lower income countries where drug donation and immunization programs have been shown to save lives and prevent disease and disabilities, reducing the risk of extreme poverty and economic instability.

Considering our pipeline, the list of products we currently market, and our external collaborations, we estimate that our Company is seeking to address 83 percent of the top 20 global burdens of disease as defined by the IHME. This is higher than the 71 percent reported in 2021 due to the inclusion of external malaria and maternal health partnerships, which were not accounted for in prior years.

As we pursue our core purpose to use the power of leading edge science to save and improve lives around the world, we also work with key stakeholders to help ensure that our science advances health care and that our products are accessible and affordable to those in need.

Discovering and inventing medicines and vaccines that address vital global health needs where we can have the greatest impact, now and in the future.

Making available a reliable, safe global supply of quality medicines and vaccines, and investing in solutions to enable timely access to our products in a responsible and sustainable manner.

Developing, testing and implementing innovative solutions that address barriers to access and affordability of our medicines and vaccines.

Through partnerships, investment and innovation, applying our expertise and investing our human and financial resources to address systemic barriers to access to health and health equity.

Our multi pronged, enterprise wide approach to access is guided by our Access to Health Guiding Principles, and is responsive to internationally recognized standards and priorities.

We embed strategies and actions across the Company to enable access.

We exclude road injuries and age related hearing loss from our GBD accounting, as they are not subject to pharmaceutical intervention.

As such, impact from more recent diseases like COVID 19 is not accounted for.

We also do not include road injuries or age related hearing loss in our GBD accounting since they are not subject to pharmaceutical intervention.

Embedded within our development R D process, we systematically evaluate our candidates to identify the potential to address significant public health burden and unmet medical needs in underserved health care settings.

This evaluation process informs our product access strategies, with the goal of making our medicines and vaccines available to as many people as possible through sustainable solutions.

To facilitate access, we undertake a systematic evaluation at the onset of Phase 2 clinical studies to determine a candidate’s potential to address unmet medical needs in LMICs.

Our approach involves evaluating the level of disease burden that exists, the availability of alternative medications, and the appropriateness of our pipeline candidates to improve public health.

For candidates with significant potential in underserved settings, access planning may start in the pre clinical phase.

Additionally, understanding where health system infrastructure and funding mechanisms are in place is an important component of enabling safe and effective usage, which ultimately facilitates meaningful patient access.

Our R D Governance Committee is accountable for the evaluation process, and all recommendations are reviewed by our Policy and ESG Council (PEC), an internal cross divisional forum of senior leaders.

When a drug or vaccine candidate with the potential to address significant public health burden in underserved health care settings is identified, the access planning process includes engaging all parts of our enterprise, as well as external stakeholders, to identify the optimal solution.

Once approved, we commit to making the product available in all countries where clinical trials have been conducted.

Products continue to be evaluated for their potential to address disease burden throughout their life cycle to account for changes in the external environment.

Sometimes the evaluation of a candidate during the R D process reveals barriers to access in low income countries or underserved settings.

In these situations, the evaluation process can inform our approach to strengthening health systems and improving health equity.

We recognize that addressing the complex and multi faceted challenges to accessing health care in LMICs requires the collaboration of multiple stakeholders.

We actively seek partnerships to achieve solutions that enable access.

One example of our approach to early access planning in the clinical trial process is our global access strategy for our investigational antiviral COVID 19 medicine.

This strategy aims to ensure timely and widespread access in the context of a pandemic.

For details on our work to accelerate broadening the reach of this medicine, please visit the Affordability and Sustainable Access section on page 69.

Merck Impact Report 2022 2023 and approaches to build relationships and reach potential study participants within their own communities (e.g., partnerships with local pharmacies and mobile study sites).

Consistent with ICH GCP requirements, as part of the informed consent process clinical trial participants are made aware of the compensation or treatment available to them and whom to contact in the event of a treatment related injury.

In addition, we maintain procedures that address the costs of treatment in the event of trial related injuries, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.

Our Global Clinical Development organization is responsible for conducting clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our pipeline candidates.

In accordance with our Public Policy Position Statement on Clinical Trial Ethics, all investigational studies in human subjects are conducted in a manner consistent with laws, regulations and guidelines for the protection of human subjects, including those issued by the International Council for Harmonisation: Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP).

However, individual country regulations and guidelines remain the primary determinant of specific requirements for the conduct of medical research.

We are committed to the study of appropriately diverse patient populations including groups that have been previously underrepresented in clinical trials: women and children, people of varying ages, sexual orientation and gender identities, various socioeconomic backgrounds and other characteristics in our clinical trials.

Currently, we conduct our trials in more than 60 countries worldwide.

In support of this commitment, we have implemented a number of programs and processes over the past several years.

Internally, we have a team of clinical trial operations experts focused on ensuring our clinical trials reflect the broad diversity of the populations we serve, and on implementing best practices in the conduct of clinical trials globally.

This begins with the selection of clinical trial sites in communities serving historically underrepresented ethnic groups.

We also provide resources and training to increase awareness and best practices for improving diversity in clinical research.

Clinical research studies sponsored by our Company are also planned and conducted to incorporate enrollment and other goals focused on increasing diversity.

Externally, our Company continues to be an active contributor and participant in various collaborations intended to connect with, support and train more U.S. based clinicians from underrepresented groups.

The aim is to help drive equitable access to clinical research at the community level.

We also co sponsor the Improving Patient Access to Clinical Trials (IMPACT) study at the Lazarex Cancer Foundation.

IMPACT is a three year pilot program that strives to increase the diversity of patients enrolled in clinical trials, as well as improve retention and equitable access in oncology trials.

Compliance in our research laboratories is focused not only on the conduct of clinical trials, but also on helping ensure robust oversight of effective policies and procedures, training, auditing and risk management, as well as sponsoring risk identification, prioritization and mitigation for our Merck Research Laboratories (MRL).

We have a Compliance Committee within MRL, with the objective of ensuring ongoing compliance through appropriate management structure, processes and training.

The Compliance Committee comprises members of the Research Leadership Team (RLT). Including the RLT in the Compliance Committee ensures cross functional awareness and ownership of ethics and compliance at the senior management level.

The Compliance Committee promotes ethical science and provides guidance to our employees within the research organization on our Company’s standards and corporate policies, as well as necessary education related to specific requirements applicable to the research community.

The rapid development of new technologies that interrogate variability in human DNA and RNA, combined with powerful computing hardware and software, has made it practical to investigate genetic and genomic determinants for risk of human disease or predictors of human response to drugs.

We conduct genetic and genomic research within our clinical trials and in collaboration with external organizations that have collected human genetic and genomic samples and health data.

We also conduct genetic and genomic analysis of our clinical trial samples, primarily to understand how genetic and genomic variation impact patient responses to medicines.

This enables us to communicate information to regulatory authorities and prescribers that will improve the use of our medicines and the understanding of how genetics contribute to the underlying disease, which has the potential to identify new drug targets.

We obtain subject consent for use of genetic and genomic samples in accordance with ethical principles of human subjects research, which include respect for persons autonomy, beneficence and justice, consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki, U.S. FDA requirements, ICH E6 Good Clinical Practices guidelines and the 1997 UNESCO Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights.

When collaborating with external organizations, we also ensure they've obtained consent from individuals who have contributed DNA, RNA and or health related data.

Together with the scientific community, we believe that research using stem cells has the potential to help identify medicines, therapies and vaccines to help treat, cure or prevent disease.

Many of the most advanced scientific technologies in regenerative medicine involve animal or human embryonic stem cells.

For more than a decade, we've applied advances in stem cell technologies to support our research and development.

The capacity of stem cells to differentiate into specific cell types underscores their versatility and utility, from early target validation and identification, to the screening and testing of potential new therapeutics, disease modeling and pre clinical proof of concept.

We conduct research using stem cells in full accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, and our own internal research policies.

Our research policy involving stem cells adheres to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences guidelines as well as those of the International Society for Stem Cell Research.

Our Regenerative Medicine Oversight Committee, which comprises both internal and external experts, oversees Company sponsored research involving stem cells, including highly targeted research using human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells.

The committee is responsible for ensuring that all projects involving stem cells adhere to our policies.

Scientific innovation relies on excellent manufacturing and commercialization execution to support broad access across the world, enabling our inventions to reach all patients in need while reducing our environmental impacts.

Our supply chain is designed to ensure we operate a lean and efficient network that produces our medicines and vaccines to the highest quality, safety and environmental standards, in full compliance with regulations and current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs), and industry best practices.

Our Company is adapting, innovating and planning for a dynamic, evolving landscape so we can continue to expand availability of lifesaving medicines and vaccines.

Some of this evolving landscape includes significant global economic pressures, including rising inflation, geopolitical insecurity and climate related disasters.

We continue making investments and driving innovations in our supply chain, with a focus on both the short and long term horizon.

Adaptations in manufacturing and supply that support greater complexity of oncology and vaccine value chains, driven by new product modalities, new delivery mechanisms, and evolving regulatory requirements.

Planning for increased demand for several new indication approvals in oncology, in addition to multiple new medicines launching in multiple countries over the short and long term.

Supporting channel expansion for vaccines, including through new public tenders.

Responding to an expanding base of customer decision makers and expanding our distribution models to address increasing shifts in private and public channel mix, including government distributors handling a greater proportion of our products.

Strong supply chain systems, made more robust with innovations for efficiency and distribution to under resourced and remote locations, will be the engine that helps us navigate these challenges.

These innovations are also driving our focus to address key supply chain constraints, while delivering on our Company’s goals for environmental sustainability.

Our Company has made significant inroads in digital capabilities across supply chain processes to respond in real time to the evolving health care ecosystem.

The most notable digital capabilities impacting availability include orchestrating the supply chain ecosystem, supply chain planning, strengthening logistics capabilities and connecting distribution channels.

We are improving the quality and agility of strategic and integrated decision making across a supply chain ecosystem.

Our objective is to connect manufacturers, transporters, third party providers, suppliers and partners with real time data.

These improvements have shortened sales and operations planning cycle time from seven weeks to four weeks, increasing our ability to respond to customer opportunities and to meet patient needs.

Throughout 2022, we worked to improve real time supply chain analytics and execution, increasing resiliency and adaptability to future supply chain disruptions and customer opportunities.

In addition, we have established automated data governance with centralized resources for master data, which has allowed for demand forecast automation and significantly improved forecast accuracy.

This planning enables us to continue to surpass our target of 95 percent of orders shipped on time and in full, with an achievement of 98.2 percent in 2022 (see Availability table on page 60).

We are building digital capabilities and enhancing business processes to create a more agile, efficient and sustainable distribution and logistics infrastructure.

These enhancements give us visibility into shipments in transit through digital logistics, enable interventions to prevent loss of product, and ensure reliable product delivery.

We also maintain our commitment to logistics security, including our track record of 100 percent of logistics partners completing security assessments (see Availability table on page 60).

We are using blockchain and advanced technologies to improve the end to end, secured flow of information with trading partners, industry peers, regulators, health care professionals and patients.

In addition, we’re collaborating on the development of an industry technology platform, PharmaLedger, to enable e leaflet capabilities at scale.

Our goal is to provide patients and health care professionals a streamlined access to the latest product information approved by health authorities and to enhance safety and adherence to treatment.

As we onboard an increasing number of markets, we are committed to significantly reducing the number of paper inserts while improving regulatory compliance.

Protect affordability: innovating supply chain designs enabling affordable, compliant and reliable access to our innovative medicines.

Flex operations: plan for supply disruptions with improved risk management and business continuity planning, including flexible manufacturing, to enable accelerated pharmaceutical formulation and process development.

Modular and podular laboratory and manufacturing allows for rapid reconfiguration to implement new process capabilities for innovative drug delivery technologies.

Adapt to exceed customer expectations: agile supply chains can pivot when the unexpected happens, improving strategic and integrated decision making to rapidly react to patient and customer opportunities and increase the reach of new medicines.

Reduce environmental impact: lower our carbon footprint and increase the sustainability of our supply chains.

Appropriately ensure people with unmet medical needs have access to our innovative, high quality products.

Maintain and grow a responsible and sustainable business.

For our manufacturing efforts, this means we are balancing internal and external licensing opportunities, including assessing new voluntary licensing and technology transfer strategies and expanding our network for supply chain design.

This business strategy enables enterprise level strategic segmentation, highlighting the specific access gaps in markets and guiding us to commercially sustainable solutions, including new archetypes for manufacturing and supply execution.

As part of the enterprise wide strategy, our manufacturing division will engage early in the life cycle of a program through a new product development and commercialization process to understand and facilitate future manufacturing, supply chain and network needs.

While not all elements will be known, an early concept of the supply and manufacturing strategy will be critical to preserve future options.

This means we start supply chain design early in Phase 1 of development.

To accelerate broad global access, our comprehensive supply and access approach includes producing millions of courses of our investigational antiviral COVID 19 medicine through our global network, which includes manufacturing sites in nine countries across three continents.

Currently, more than 20 percent of the world's population cannot be reached through health care delivery systems.

No one in need should be denied access to lifesaving medicines due to lack of infrastructure or transportation.

Our Company’s vision to increase access to our medicines and vaccines across the globe includes exploring the delivery of our products by drones in rural areas.

Drone delivery helps us serve low resource settings with limited logistical capabilities.

It also helps us provide medical supplies during and after acute events like natural disasters or pandemics.

We started exploring the use of drone delivery after Hurricane Maria isolated many people in Puerto Rico.

The use of drones can be a safe, compliant and reliable method of delivering cold chain dependent products when patients are isolated.

We have also developed a proof of concept drone delivery with a validated thermal protection system for isolated Native American communities in rural Alaska and in North Dakota.

The proof of concept showed we can create access to our patients and customers despite logistical challenges.

In the last few years, various countries have introduced new or expanded routine vaccination programs creating unprecedented increases in global demand for vaccines.

To meet this demand, we will continue to increase our capacity and our supply capability across our vaccine portfolio.

Our Company plans to invest approximately 20 billion in capital projects from 2021 2025, with a portion dedicated to vaccines.

We continue to invest in manufacturing and end to end supply improvements in both capability and capacity to help ensure a sustainable, reliable supply of quality and affordable vaccines to serve global needs.

Our manufacturing division continuously works to improve manufacturing processes and reduce operating costs by increasing efficiency, minimizing procurement spending and improving supply performance.

To provide high quality vaccines to people who need them, we manage our supply chain through policies and procedures designed to keep the distribution system secure.

We also continue to explore potential strategic partnerships with other manufacturers to increase supply and promote greater access in local markets.

The global reach of our vaccines has increased significantly.

Ex U.S. distribution of our vaccines was 78 percent in 2022, up from 34 percent in 2013.

This represents important progress toward ensuring that these vaccines reach people around the world, including in LMICs, who are at high risk for certain vaccine preventable illnesses.

For example, we have committed over 100 million doses of our HPV vaccine for use in Gavi supported countries from 2021 2025.

ERVEBO (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live) is the world’s first FDA approved, WHO prequalified vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus disease.

Through our agreement with UNICEF, we have built a 500,000 dose ERVEBO stockpile, and continue delivering licensed doses to maintain the stockpile.

As of March 2023, the vaccine has been approved in ten African countries.

Additionally, in response to the health and humanitarian crisis of the Sudan ebolavirus outbreak in Uganda in 2022, our Company collaborated with IAVI, a global nonprofit scientific research organization, to produce and donate vials of investigational candidate Sudan ebolavirus vaccine for use in IAVI’s Sudan ebolavirus vaccine development program.

The vials were produced from existing investigational bulk drug substance previously manufactured by our Company.

We seek to ensure global access to our medicines and vaccines by obtaining and maintaining up to date product registrations around the globe.

In order to make our products available to the people who need them throughout the world, we registered 156 products and devices in 2022.

The majority of these products were registered in LMICs in the Asia Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Americas regions.

In addition to having our medicines and vaccines approved by regulatory authorities, when relevant to enhancing access in LMICs, we also work to have certain medicines and vaccines prequalified through the WHO prequalification process so that our products may be easily procured by and distributed to these LMIC populations.

The table on the following page summarizes the registration and WHO prequalification status of a select list of our vaccines.

WHO prequalification facilitates product procurement by United Nations agencies in many LMICs.

In the absence of stringent national medicine authorities, it serves to certify products meet required quality, safety and efficacy standards.

WHO’s prequalification program covers routine vaccines and medicines for HIV AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis, diarrhoeal diseases and select neglected tropical diseases.

We have made efforts to address the unique needs of LMICs where the infrastructure and personnel to deliver immunization services can be severely limited.

Specifically, we have focused on product improvements such as the introduction of vaccine vial monitors (VVMs) for use to assess controlled temperature chain conditions.

In May 2022, we obtained WHO approval for our Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines’ compatibility for use outside the cold chain for up to four days.

This helps enhance accessibility for hard to reach populations.

Not currently available through UNICEF procurement awaiting Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM).

Inspired by our former chairman, George W. Merck, who once said We can never rest until a way has been found to bring our finest achievements to everyone, we are working towards a world where everyone, everywhere has the option to receive the right medicines or vaccines when they need them.

We strive to do this in a way that creates sustainable access to innovative medicines and vaccines, creating long term value for patients, health systems and our Company.

We seek to understand the barriers that stand in the way of people receiving the right medicines and vaccines when they need them.

The underlying challenges that constrain patient access range from adequate capacity and channels for care delivery to sustainable financing.

Within a wider ecosystem, different stakeholders including private, governmental, multilateral and nonprofit organizations have a unique role in reducing barriers and expanding sustainable access to health.

Our approach is predicated on the belief that broadening access to medicines and vaccines is best achieved through collaborating with multiple stakeholders to enable solutions that solve the needs of people today and for generations to come.

We recognize that an enabling policy environment is critical to solving access and affordability challenges.

Therefore, we engage with governments, industry associations, trade and economic forums, think tanks and academia to advocate for evidence based policy solutions.

For example, we are actively involved in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation’s (APEC) Health Care Financing initiatives.

Through this effort, we are creating a roadmap that outlines priorities, objectives and targets for strengthening health care financing, sharing best practices from APEC economies, and strengthening the dialogue across industry, governments and academia to diagnose and solve pressing affordability challenges.

We also participated in dialogue at the Health20 (H20), Business20 (B20) side event, with the Atlantic Council, the World Cancer Congress, and alongside the UN General Assembly to promote evidence based policies that can improve investment in health.

To achieve sustainable access, health care resources must be used in a more efficient and equitable way.

This transformation can only be achieved by learning and progressing together with cross industry partners.

The Global Coalition for Value in Healthcare was launched at the World Economic Forum in 2019, and aims to accelerate the development of value based healthcare around the world.

We are also contributing to the Global Innovation Hub Expert Review Committee by acting as advisor to the group.

By supporting early adopters in value based health care and spreading the learnings, we are working to inspire other health systems around the globe to embrace and implement value oriented health care strategies and models, which would contribute to achieving sustainable access.

Similarly, we work with organizations like ThinkWell to study and promote policies for sustainable financing for immunizations and comprehensive cancer prevention and care.

Through collaborating with multiple stakeholders to address access to health challenges, we believe that more patients would benefit from a broad range of innovative medicines and vaccines, including ours.

We work in partnership to develop and deliver solutions that enable more people to have sustainable access to medicines and vaccines.

In 2021, we set a goal to enable 100 million more people globally to access our innovative portfolio through access strategies, solutions and partnerships by 2025, relative to a 2020 baseline.

In 2022, we exceeded this goal and enabled access for 189.2 million people (see table below).

We are committed to continue driving our aspiration and therefore increased this goal from 100 million to 350 million more people enabled to access to our innovative portfolio by 2025.

We continue expanding the reach of our innovative portfolio through developing therapy specific access strategies, solutions and partnerships.

We operate as an integrated Company across global, regional and market teams to address access challenges through multiple initiatives.

We have established a systematic framework, which is available to all our markets, for diagnosing barriers to access, designing and delivering practical solutions that can help solve access challenges.

We have also established a dedicated internal unit to systematically accelerate innovation, continuously evolve the relevant capabilities and capture learnings across various countries.

Through this approach we have been able to accelerate the development of innovation in patient access models and solutions to expand the accessible population across the globe.

In collaboration with Financial Times Longitude, we launched the Sustainable Access website to advocate for greater collaborations among various stakeholders to develop, test and scale solutions that help expand sustainable access to innovative treatments and vaccines.

Innovative portfolio of products refers to our Company’s on patent products.

Enable more people is defined as implemented and launched in market and will be in comparison to the baseline (2020) as of 2025.

Evidence for metrics are sourced from the best publicly available data and proxy sources by market.

While proxies differ by market, all methodologies are evaluated and represent the best estimate of people enabled to access innovative medicines and vaccines.

People who were enabled to access innovative medicines and vaccines did not necessarily receive such innovative medicines and vaccines.

Total people reached with the MECTIZAN Donation Program increased in 2022 as partner countries resumed additional MECTIZAN distribution following disruptions due to the pandemic.

For more information on the details related to the people reached through donations, please see page 70.

We have been building capabilities to support a portfolio of initiatives aimed at advancing sustainable access globally.

These include enabling health care systems to better serve those in need through customer collaborations, health care financing, employer benefit design, and new delivery channels in LMICs.

We recognize that in some environments, the challenge lies in having resilient health care systems that can reach patients at the right time with the right intervention.

That is why we collaborate with health care and service providers in the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Brazil and Colombia to understand challenges across the care pathway and help advance solutions that can strengthen health care systems.

Leveraging our clinical expertise, particularly in oncology, and our deep understanding of the health care ecosystem, we partner with the health care systems to better understand cancer patient pathway constraints and identify solutions that enable access and the optimal use of resources.

We convened a broad coalition of eight National Health Services (NHS) Cancer Alliances and five national representative organizations to create the Do It For Yourself Campaign.

This campaign raises awareness of distinguishing symptoms of lung cancer from those of COVID 19, and encourages people living in areas with high incidence to seek advice from their doctors if they have concerns about such symptoms.

We also partner with more than 20 NHS Trust and Cancer Alliances to leverage data and analytical tools to help them better understand oncology treatment capacity constraints and explore opportunities to optimize their existing capacity.

In Colombia, we have been working with multiple health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and oncology health care providers (HCPs) to identify inefficiencies and pain points in diagnosis pathways in lung and breast cancers to reduce the time to diagnosis.

One of the recurring access challenges in LMICs is the potentially high out of pocket costs for critical illness treatments.

Recognizing this issue, we have continued collaboration with reinsurers and insurance companies in, among others, South Africa, Thailand and Indonesia to develop affordable health insurance products for the population, including covering innovative cancer therapies.

We are also actively collaborating with public health authorities to provide access to immunotherapy financing through supplemental medical insurance in China, providing options for the population and driving greater health care inclusion.

We believe that expanding the reach of insurance products will help solve major access hurdles and, in turn, help increase access to innovative cancer therapies for patients.

This collaborative approach to addressing access challenges reinforces our commitment to being part of a wider ecosystem, collaborating with others with complementary capabilities to tackle these access challenges.

In the U.S., employers play an important role in the health care system through their employee health plans.

In recent years, many organizations have faced spiraling costs especially related to cancer care and treatment.

The principles of value based insurance design (V BID) focuses on structuring health plans so that they incentivize high value interventions and disincentivize low value care.

This aims to achieve two outcomes: improve patient outcomes and manage costs, which allows funding to be reallocated to support innovative new treatments.

Identify opportunities to move from low value to high value care.

Use data continuously to refine and evolve the plan.

We have been sharing the lessons that we have drawn from this pilot with various stakeholders and other employers.

By sharing our experience, we hope that this will help other employers to develop their own innovations to improve their employee health care plans and widen access to quality care.

Many underserved populations around the world rely heavily on the private sector for accessing health care.

This is exacerbated in LMICs, where supply chain and distribution in these markets are often highly fragmented and multi layered.

To address these challenges, we are supporting local networks and leveraging technology solutions that optimize supply chains in resource constrained settings.

For example, we are one of the sponsors of the Investing in Innovation (i3) initiative, a global network of industry players, donors and international organizations that seeks high potential startups who aspire to transform the availability, accessibility, affordability, quality and visibility of health products at scale across Africa.

Another example is our collaboration with a health care provider with a presence in 12 African countries.

Through this partnership, we seek to reimagine the prevention, screening and treatment of cervical cancer across Africa.

We are committed to working with the health care providers on disease awareness and in designing innovative access solutions to our medicines and vaccines by increasing affordability for more people.

Additional information on sustainable access strategies, solutions and partnerships can be found on the Sustainable Access website.

Inequitable access to vaccines and vaccination services threaten to stall and even reverse progress made in combating the spread of vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs).

Every year, 1.5 million deaths occur due to VPDs, particularly among historically marginalized groups and populations.

We are committed to expanding access to our vaccines for people and communities around the globe.

Collaborating with Gavi and UNICEF to expand global access to our vaccines.

Obtaining approval in May 2022 from WHO for our HPV vaccines to be used outside the cold chain for up to four days, helping to enhance accessibility for hard to reach populations.

Establishing a research and development collaboration with Hilleman.

Developing an investigational vaccine for the prevention of dengue fever in collaboration with Instituto Butantan (IB). Under the agreement announced in December 2018, we and IB are sharing clinical data and other learnings from their respective dengue vaccine development programs.

Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) is a public private partnership that helps vaccinate half the world’s children against some of our planet's deadliest diseases.

According to its Annual Progress Report, since its inception in 2000 Gavi has helped to immunize a whole generation reaching one billion children and prevented more than 16.2 million future deaths.

Gavi's work has cut child mortality in half in 73 lower income countries.

Gavi also plays a key role in improving global health security by supporting health systems and funding global stockpiles for Ebola, cholera, meningococcal and yellow fever vaccines.

As a permanent member of Gavi's board, and the world's biggest buyer and supplier of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF has a pivotal role in implementing immunization programs in Gavi supported countries and in shaping the Vaccine Alliance's policies.

UNICEF's Supply Division procures the majority of Gavi funded vaccines.

It helps countries analyze and overcome obstacles to improving immunization coverage and equity, and works with WHO to support countries applying for and implementing health system strengthening grants.

Our commitment to helping protect global health by improving the resilience of immunization programs and broadening access to our vaccines around the world is fundamental to our mission and highlighted through our long term commitment to Gavi and UNICEF. To broaden access to our Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which is indicated to help prevent HPV related cancers and diseases, our Company provides this vaccine to the public sectors of countries that are eligible for support from Gavi at an access price that is significantly less than the value based price in other countries.

Through a long term agreement with UNICEF, we committed to provide over 100 million doses of our HPV vaccine for use in Gavi supported countries, from 2021 2025.

In addition, through our agreement with UNICEF, we have built a 500,000 dose ERVEBO stockpile, and continue delivering licensed doses to maintain the stockpile.

As of March 2023, the vaccine has been approved in ten African countries.

Finally, for 2021 2025, we committed to extend our current Gavi prices for our HPV vaccine to Gavi graduated countries with a per capita gross national income (GNI) not exceeding 3,200.

This greatly assists in expanding and sustaining access in countries that have transitioned out of Gavi support.

We believe that our pricing approach in conjunction with our commitment to partner with stakeholders to strengthen resilience of immunization programs contributes to broader access to our vaccines worldwide.

We expand reach of our innovations to at need population and patients including those in LMICs through our access strategies and planning as well as programs and partnerships, taking into consideration unmet public health need, economic conditions and health care infrastructure.

We have a long history of making our medicines and vaccines accessible and affordable through responsible pricing practices and industry leading patient access programs.

We are working to bring our medicines and vaccines to more people around the world in ways that are as accessible and affordable as possible for the patients who need them.

In 2017, we began disclosing information about the price of our medicines in the U.S. Our 2022 U.S. Pricing Transparency Report shows an average annual net price increase of 4.3 percent in 2022.

The average annual list price across our portfolio increased by 4.4 percent in 2022.

The Company’s gross U.S. sales were reduced by 39.7 percent in 2022 as a result of rebates, discounts and returns.

For more information on our approach to pricing, please see our U.S. Pricing.

Transparency Report which is available on the Transparency Disclosures page of our corporate website.

We entered into advance purchase and supply agreements with the governments of more than 40 countries, and are currently in discussions with additional governments, implementing a tiered pricing approach based on World Bank country income criteria to reflect countries’ relative ability to finance their health response to the pandemic.

We signed voluntary license agreements early on during the clinical development process, with multiple established Indian generic manufacturers and the Medicines Patent Pool to facilitate the availability of generic versions of our medicine to more than 100 low and middle income countries.

We allocated up to three million courses of therapy to UNICEF for low and middle income countries as a bridge strategy until the voluntary licensees were able to supply.

This strategy has been successful to minimize the gap between the supply to high income counties and the supply to LMICs.

We welcomed the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation’s commitment of 120 million to accelerate access to generic versions of our medicine.

This commitment complements our voluntary license agreements with generic manufacturers and highlights the importance of actions from multiple stakeholders to effectively increase timely access to medicines for patients globally.

Through our licensing agreements with generics manufacturers and the Medicines Patent Pool, more than five million courses of generic therapy have been delivered to more than 20 low and middle income countries included in the licenses from 2021 2022.

When market based solutions are inadequate or unavailable, we pursue programs to provide direct access to our medicines and vaccines, including product donations and patient assistance programs.

In 2022, we reached over 359 million people with product donations through the MECTIZAN Donation Program, the U.S.

Patient Assistance Program, and the Merck Medical Outreach Program (MMOP) for disaster relief and humanitarian aid.

Patient Assistance Program, or the Merck Medical Outreach Program.

Estimated figures assume all product reached patients, and are based on converting volume of medicines and vaccines donated.

This estimate calculates the number of people who accessed the treatment, and is therefore a sub set of treatments approved.

Volumes vary across years based on changes in covered product offerings and changes across the health care landscape.

Volumes in 2021 reflect a decline as a result of products transitioned to Organon Co. in the 2021 spin off.

Conversion factors for this estimate were developed using a combination of IQVIA SMART Data and U.S. product information found on our product website.

Our Company has committed to providing as much MECTIZAN as needed for as long as needed to treat river blindness through the MECTIZAN Donation Program (MDP) globally.

The 35 year, global program is the longest running disease specific drug donation effort of its kind.

Our donation commitment has expanded over the years to include the treatment of lymphatic filariasis.

Since the program’s inception, our Company has donated nearly five billion MECTIZAN treatments and has made significant impacts on health systems in some of the hardest to reach communities around the world.

The MDP is one of the most successful public private health partnerships of its kind.

For more information, please see the MECTIZAN story on our corporate website.

We are committed to supporting communities around the world that are affected by natural disasters and humanitarian crises.

We look to local authorities and humanitarian relief agencies to first assess need and then respond in a timely, coordinated manner.

We provide aid through financial and product donations to meet the immediate needs of affected communities.

Value also includes relief for Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Fiona and support to the Red Cross' efforts.

As a demonstration of our commitment to helping low income, uninsured patients gain access to Merck medicines and adult vaccines, we participate in the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Medicine Assistance Tool (MAT).

MAT is a free search engine designed to help patients, loved ones and health care providers access hundreds of public and private assistance programs.

To date, this tool has helped millions of Americans in financial need get free or reduced cost prescription medicines.

The Merck Medical Outreach Program (MMOP) is the primary means through which we donate pharmaceuticals and vaccines for humanitarian assistance in the developing world and in support of disaster relief worldwide.

The MMOP helps expand access to our products, particularly in developing countries, by donating pharmaceuticals and vaccines to a limited number of qualified, U.S. based NGO partners.

The scope and reach of the MMOP varies from year to year and is influenced by changing medical needs in developing countries, the quantity of our medicines available for donation and the unpredictable nature of emergencies or disasters.

As the war in Ukraine continues, we’re committed to getting life saving support, medicines, vaccines and supplies to those who need them most.

In 2022, we committed donations of more than 100 million in essential products and funds to various organizations, working in tandem with our own subsidiary in the region to ensure that refugees and those who remain inside the country have access to health care.

As the COVID 19 pandemic continued through 2022, our Company donated 100,000 courses of our investigational antiviral COVID 19 medicine to Direct Relief, a global humanitarian aid organization, for distribution to refugees, including 50,000 courses for people affected by the invasion of Ukraine.

For more information, please visit the MMOP page on our corporate website.

In 2022, we invested 38 million in partnerships, programs and impact investments that support health care capacity building and address underlying barriers to access to health.

These social investments accelerate our Company’s purpose of saving and improving lives by advancing global health equity, deploying our resources where and when needed, and creating long term value for society and our business.

We are improving cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment strengthening the vaccination ecosystem advancing maternal health and strengthening health systems to advance equitable health outcomes for all patients.

We provide this support in several ways, including through philanthropic social investments, key initiatives and impact investing.

To be most effective, where appropriate we align our investments with country and community led priorities and partner with governmental, multilateral and nonprofit organizations.

We reached more than 18 million people in LMICs and underserved populations in the U.S. in 2022 with our social investments, bringing our two year total (2021 2022) to more than 33 million people, beyond our initial five year goal of reaching 30 million people.

We are further strengthening our longstanding commitment to advancing health equity by setting a more ambitious goal to reach 50 million people by 2025.

In addition to the people we reach through our social investments, we also track health care workers trained through the initiatives we support extending impact for years to come.

In 2022, our partners trained an estimated 316,000 health workers.

This result includes a significant increase in health workers trained through our Merck for Mothers program as we continue to scale those efforts.

Underserved populations are defined as those that face health disparities due to disadvantages related to insurance status, social determinants of health, race, ethnicity, gender identity sexual orientation, age and or language preference.

The goal is cumulative across the reporting period of 2021 2025, and is independent of a baseline period.

In some cases, third party reports may include cumulative people reached for the reporting period, and or data that is attributable to other partners as well as our Company's philanthropic investment.

Our philanthropic investments help advance health equity around the world by addressing the barriers that many individuals face in seeking and receiving high quality health care.

Meeting critical global health needs where we can have a meaningful impact.

Promoting health equity by helping to reduce health disparities in underserved communities.

Collaborating with diverse partners across sectors to build healthier, stronger communities culturally responsive care in underserved communities in the U.S. With a 20 million commitment over five years, the Foundation will support the development and implementation of innovative, comprehensive cancer care programs that can improve patient outcomes and help ensure equitable care by addressing access barriers related to social determinants of health.

The Foundation also supports programs that aim to improve the delivery of cancer care in low and middle income countries.

Through a grant of nearly 2 million over five years, the Foundation is supporting the American Cancer Society to establish patient navigation programs in resource limited settings in sub Saharan Africa and develop a toolkit to help other countries adopt navigation programs as part of delivering comprehensive cancer care.

Through these programs, we believe that by working closely with others governments, donors, patient groups, health care professionals, nonprofit organizations, academic institutions, multilateral agencies and the private sector we can help build stronger health systems that provide better and more equitable care.

Our Foundation has invested in programs that help people living with chronic conditions, including cancer, to receive high quality health care.

Over the past five years, we have supported efforts to increase timely access to patient centered care and reduce disparities in cancer care across the U.S. through the Alliance to Advance Patient Centered Cancer Care.

This 15 million initiative supports evidence informed, multi faceted programs to enhance the delivery of equitable cancer care in underserved communities across six U.S. cities.

We also recognize that our success depends in large part on our relationships and interactions with local communities, including patients, community leaders, nonprofit organizations, local businesses, schools, elected officials and local media.

The communities where we operate are home not only to our customers but also to our workforce and many of our suppliers.

It is critical to understand the concerns and needs of our communities and address local challenges so that we can help build stronger communities and support the sustainability of our business.

We contribute to the economy of local communities directly and indirectly through employment, training, support of local suppliers, local R D and paying taxes.

We also strive to have a positive impact on communities by protecting the environment, maintaining safe operations and respecting human rights.

Our community engagement programs aim to strengthen communities where our employees live and work by helping address critical health and social needs.

The Solutions for Healthy Communities program formerly known as the Neighbor of Choice program seeks to catalyze innovation in community solutions that facilitate access to quality health care for underserved populations.

This program invests in NGOs that are addressing cross cutting barriers to heath care access in the global communities where we operate.

Maternal health outcomes highlight the strength of a health system.

In many countries, unacceptable and inequitable maternal health outcomes persist.

Merck for Mothers is our 650 million global initiative to help create a world where no woman has to die while giving life.

For a decade and counting, we have brought Merck’s scientific and business expertise to help carve a path to a better world where maternal health outcomes are more equitable, and pregnancy and childbirth are safer.

Our efforts are focused on bringing fresh thinking and infusing new approaches to help end the longstanding challenge of maternal mortality.

We focus on strengthening health systems to sustain the delivery of high quality maternity care services that benefit women and their communities.

With our grantees and collaborators, we are improving health systems for women today and for the long term by advancing quality standards, catalyzing solutions that respond to community needs and harnessing private sector innovations for maternal health.

For more information, please visit the Merck for Mothers website.

In addition to the philanthropic investments mentioned above, we are building a range of partnerships to strengthen cancer prevention, care and support systems to help improve health equity in underserved communities.

In the U.S., we have supported the American Cancer Society’s Get Screened campaign, aimed at reducing existing disparities in cancer screening that have been exacerbated by the COVID 19 pandemic.

Through the CEO Roundtable on Cancer, we support Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) in Going for Gold to help improve health equity, education, navigation and access in communities disproportionately affected by cancer.

Globally, we collaborate with City Cancer Challenge Foundation to improve equitable access to quality cancer care in nine cities around the world by strengthening patient navigation, care coordination and data capacity through the integration of digital platforms in health systems.

In working with Go Further, we have created a partnership that aims to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in women living with HIV who reside in one of 12 African countries, which have some of the highest rates of HIV prevalence and cervical cancer incidence in the world.

Impact investing is one of our core approaches to advancing sustainable global health solutions and health equity in line with our Company’s overall objectives.

Through impact investing, we deploy financial resources in ways that may generate not only improved access to health care for underserved populations, but also financial returns and strategic opportunities all while growing a sustainable global health ecosystem and attracting additional capital and partners.

In addition, to support the sustainability of our work, we intend to direct any financial returns from our impact investing into new investments to grow our portfolio.

For example, our Company is an investor in Mamotest, a company providing AI enabled telediagnosis for breast cancer and digital solutions for oncology patient support for women in Latin America.

For more information, please visit our Impact Investing page on our corporate website, as well as GRI 201 1 on page 51.

Our approach to health equity is key to our Sustainability and Global Diversity Inclusion (GD I) commitments, and is reflected in how business units across the enterprise are integrating health equity goals and capabilities in their business strategies and performance objectives.

These efforts are guided by an enterprise Health Equity Strategic Framework that lays out clear goals, and a roadmap with an implementation plan to guide how we integrate health equity across our core business functions and practices.

In 2022, we launched a 1 million Health Equity Catalyst Fund to empower teams at the local and regional levels to create solutions that promote more equitable health outcomes and care experiences, particularly for populations who are underserved.

The Health Equity Catalyst Fund is supporting 15 community level efforts in 13 countries to remove barriers to care and or strengthen health systems to deliver on high quality and accountable care.

We are also investing in strengthening internal data capabilities so that we can apply social determinants of health data to support the design and rollout of effective solutions and partnerships, as well as track key metrics that help us to better understand the impact of our social investments.

We support our employees so that they have the latest knowledge and data through the development of training resources, guidelines, tools and a collaborative health equity learning network.

Global Economic Inclusion Supplier Diversity (EI SD) is integrated into our overall Global Diversity Inclusion (GD I) strategy, and supports our corporate aspiration.

Global Economic Inclusion and Supplier Diversity is a key priority of the GD I Business Consortium (for more information, see GRI 405 on page 134).

The EI SD Center of Excellence (CoE) is the epicenter of our Company’s diverse and inclusive procurement practices.

We create economic opportunities for underrepresented communities by procuring products and services from minority , women , veteran , LGBTQ and disability owned enterprises.

Our goals go beyond the amount of money we spend with small and diverse owned businesses, as we focus on the growth and development of our suppliers to drive economic impact and value delivery to our Company.

We are committed to supporting the small and diverse businesses that are the economic engine of growth around the world through global economic inclusion.

High performing businesses not only build diverse workforces, but also effectively leverage talent to fully realize diverse perspectives.

Part of leveraging diverse talent involves partnering with suppliers that understand how to lead and motivate others to achieve common goals, communicate strategies effectively and make sound financial decisions.

The Advanced Leadership Program (ALP) for Diverse Suppliers provides an executive development opportunity for diverse business owners to enhance their leadership and business acumen to strengthen and grow their business.

Designed in collaboration with Drexel University and Diversity Alliance for Science (DA4S), this experiential development program focuses on application and is supported by evidenced based research and practitioner industry experience.

Participants have an opportunity to engage with Drexel University faculty, their peers, and organizational leaders from our Company in thought provoking, facilitated discussions that enhance self reflection and personal development while building relationships across the broader community network.

The ALP integrated program modules support an overarching theme of growing and scaling small and or diverse businesses by building the leadership abilities and business acumen of diverse business owners.

Led by an interdisciplinary faculty and subject matter expert team, each module provides an experiential and applied approach to executive development.

In addition, participants complete a Request for Proposal (RFP) Capstone Challenge that offers an invaluable experience through the coaching and feedback they receive on their presentations and overall performance.

In 2022, we had 15 diverse suppliers graduate from our second cohort.

We are proud to continue with this program in 2023.

In 2022, our spend with minority , women , veteran , LGBTQ and disability owned business enterprises represented 14 percent of our total procurement spend.

We have expanded our supplier diversity program through our Second Tier Diverse Supplier Program.

In addition to monitoring our own purchases to ensure we have diverse suppliers providing quality goods and services, we also monitor our large Tier 1 suppliers to ensure the inclusion of diverse suppliers within their own supply chain as well.

The overall objective is to encourage the development of sustainable opportunities for diverse suppliers to participate in the procurement process.

The Second Tier Diverse Supplier Program serves as an enhancement to, and not as a replacement for, existing efforts aimed at increasing meaningful opportunities for diverse suppliers to participate at the Tier 1 level.

In 2022, 21 Tier 1 suppliers participated in our Second Tier Diverse Supplier Program, generating an impact of over 258 million through their inclusion and utilization of diverse suppliers for direct purchases on behalf of our Company.

University of Washington, Foster School of Business.

Our ongoing economic inclusion and supplier diversity efforts will enable us to continue our membership in the Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR), an exclusive industry organization that recognizes and celebrates corporations that achieve spending of at least 1 billion with minority , women , veteran , LGBTQ and disability owned enterprises headquartered in the U.S. and globally.

Our membership in the BDR allows us to share and access best practices in supply chain diversity excellence with other organizations that have also achieved this status.

As part of our 35 years of inclusion and impact, we hosted the 2022 Billion Dollar Roundtable Summit with the theme, The Future is Now: Supplier Diversity as a Force of Sustainability, Economic Equality and Societal Impact.

The Summit provided another opportunity to chart a course for the bold and transformative steps that are urgently needed to ensure we are optimizing positive economic impact to some of our most distressed areas, sharing best practices and encouraging global partners to continue to deliver on our purpose.

For more than 10 years, we have pursued economic inclusion and supplier diversity efforts outside of the U.S. as well.

We believe that global supplier diversity can help foster inclusivity, drive innovation, expand market reach, reduce risks, comply with regulations and build a positive reputation.

One example of our efforts outside of the U.S. is in South Africa, where we are proud to be creating a more sustainable and resilient supply chain while making a positive economic impact.

Despite the right to equality, not all people in South Africa are born into equal circumstances.

The history of South Africa has resulted in an economic and opportunities disparity based on race, and has resulted in many Black people in South Africa continuing to experience economic marginalization in one of the world's most unequal societies.

Broad Based, Black Economic Empowerment (B BBEE) is a government policy to advance economic transformation and enhance the economic participation of Black people in the South African economy.

B BBEE related strategies that we establish help achieve this goal and ensure that our South African subsidiary is compliant with the government’s B BBEE regulations while helping to transform South Africa.

The B BBEE program is also an important strategic enabler to our Company’s growth strategy in the region and key to addressing the significant unmet health needs of patients.

Our efforts include a 756,000 grant through MSD for Mothers to Unjani Clinics.

This clinic is a South African based, low fee primary health care organization that services patients in disadvantaged communities who cannot afford private health insurance, so that they can access basic services such as maternal health.

As part of this grant, we supported the ACFS Feeding Scheme, a nonprofit organization that provides meals, school materials, clothing and toiletries to 1,000 children from child headed households.

These households are led by children largely due to the continuing challenges linked with HIV AIDS.

Furthermore, to address youth unemployment, which sits at a staggering 59 percent in South Africa, we are a proud participant in the Youth Employment Service (YES) Initiative.

This program seeks to connect talented and engaged young work seekers to various opportunities, and hosts its own biennial graduate development program, which has provided jobs to 30 youth since its inception in 2021.

For more information on our procurement practices and supplier diversity, please also see GRI 2 6 on page 35, GRI 308 on page 112, GRI 405 on page 134 and GRI 414 on page 145.

Our Company is built on its reputation for ethics and integrity forged with health care professionals (HCPs), patients and other stakeholders.

Bribery and corruption are illegal, tarnish a company's reputation, and undermine public trust.

Offering or paying bribes or kickbacks is against the laws of the markets where we do business.

We are committed to observing the laws and regulations that govern our operations and activities wherever we do business.

To that end, we maintain policies, procedures and processes that apply to Company activities involving transfer of value (TOV), including TOV to HCPs and third party intermediaries that perform agreed to services on our behalf.

We have a well established global ethics and compliance program that is consistent with the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA) Code of Practice requirements, as well as with other applicable regional or country industry codes of conduct, including those issued by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).

Our Board of Directors and senior management, including our chief ethics and compliance officer, provide the foundational elements of leadership, accountability and structure to oversee the Company’s global ethics and compliance program.

Our chief ethics and compliance officer reports directly to our CEO, and provides regular updates to senior leaders and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on key indicators of ethical culture and compliance and risk trends.

This reporting structure supports transparent and independent communication of relevant risk information relating to ethics and compliance issues.

Our Company’s anti bribery anti corruption program and policies give employees (and third parties with whom we engage) the awareness, knowledge and resources to operate with integrity and comply with applicable laws and regulations, and to understand that we will not tolerate any act, or even the appearance, of impropriety.

Our corporate anti corruption policy prohibits the offer, promise or giving of any payment or benefit at any time to an individual or entity for the purpose of improperly influencing decisions or actions with respect to our business.

The policy also prohibits any act that may give the appearance of offering anything of value for a business advantage.

It applies to direct engagements (i.e., those conducted by our Company) as well as to indirect engagements (i.e., those managed through a third party intermediary or partner).

There are additional divisional policies reinforcing these principles in connection with certain activities.

Our Business Partner Code of Conduct presents similar and consistent principles for our business partners.

It states that business partners shall not offer pay, ask for or accept anything of value or give the appearance that they do in order to improperly influence decisions or actions with respect to any Company business or government activities.

We expect all our business partners to adhere to these principles and operate in full compliance, including maintaining processes and procedures to prevent and detect corrupt activities.

An important component of our corporate ethics and compliance program is our annual ethics and policy certification.

The annual review process requires selected employees to certify adherence to the Code of Conduct and corporate policies on preventing bribery and corruption, antitrust law compliance, conflict of interest and insider trading.

These employees are also expected to regulate their outside activities to avoid any conflicts of interest and to certify, in writing, whether actual or potential conflicts of interest exist.

Where potential conflicts are identified, the Office of Ethics will work with management to take actions to mitigate the potential conflict.

In addition, U.S. based (including Puerto Rico) employees must certify compliance with our policy on the effects of exclusions, debarments, suspensions and health care related criminal convictions, reporting and screening.

The annual compliance certification process is supplemented by periodic market and regional risk based discussions and ongoing risk data monitoring.

Training is an important part of creating a strong ethics and compliance culture.

To ensure that all employees understand our ethical expectations and principles, we provide an annual ethics and compliance training series that includes relevant content to enable employees to perform with integrity and to make appropriate value based decisions in the course of their work.

In 2022, more than 99 percent of our employees completed assigned training on anti bribery and anti corruption.

Supplemental training on anti bribery and anti corruption is provided for employees who engage with non U.S. government officials.

As our Company is headquartered in the U.S., with a global footprint, our employees in the Human Health Division outside of the U.S. are made aware of the implication of statutes like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

Employees in the Human Health Division in the U.S. are also required to understand, among other things, their responsibilities under the Anti Kickback Statute, the U.S.

Our Company believes that our customers and society as a whole benefit from fair, free and open markets.

While ours is a competitive industry where it is important that we compete aggressively, it is equally important that we do so fairly, legally and based on the merits of our products and services.

Our interactions with customers, suppliers and competitors are governed by antitrust and competition laws, as well as corporate policies.

We enforce these external and internal standards through our ethics and compliance program.

We recognize that our reputation for integrity, trust, honesty and fair dealing continues to be dependent on our ethical practices.

Consequently, we want to make certain that the ways in which we promote customer choice, business relationships and business practices are positive and fair.

Our professional sales representatives are guided by our policies to recognize that competitive advantage is gained through the merits of our products and services, never through unethical or illegal business practices.

We believe that our marketing, sales and advertising activities make an important contribution to medicine by informing our customers of treatment options based on the most recent scientific information and findings from rigorous clinical studies.

Our sales and marketing practices are governed by external laws and regulations and industry codes of conduct, our own global Code of Conduct, our corporate policies and procedures, and our ethics and compliance program.

Our ethics and compliance program addresses and seeks to prevent inappropriate practices, and we evaluate our policies and procedures as appropriate.

Our practices are monitored and compliance is enforced, to ensure that our interactions with customers and consumers do not include making unsubstantiated competitive claims.

Also, a part of the business requires the Company to communicate with policymakers and other stakeholders to address certain gaps in a market and promote patient access.

In such interactions, we are careful not to develop tactics aimed at preventing or delaying access of generic products into the market, and such communications are governed by our marketing communications principles.

All new employees receive training and testing, and must be certified on relevant policies and our Company’s ethical operating standards.

Although many of our employees who market and sell our medicines and vaccines have advanced scientific or medical degrees and backgrounds, all of our sales representatives must complete general sales and product training.

Training is specific to the country where an employee is based and covers the scope of the employee’s responsibilities in ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

We stress that if our employees are unsure about the appropriateness of the conduct that they ask for help.

There are several places where employees can turn for assistance.

In addition to mandatory training on our Code of Conduct, employees receive training on other levels of business practice and compliance according to their roles and responsibilities.

We evaluate and update the content for all marketing and sales training periodically to ensure that it remains relevant and current.

While antitrust and competition laws may differ in the countries where our Company operates, the fundamental principles remain the same.

From a broad perspective, antitrust and competition laws are legislated to promote competitive markets with the notion that when competitors and sellers can compete effectively against each other, customers will be the ultimate beneficiary.

All employees are educated on the overall principles and, with the help of the relevant legal and compliance functions, they are expected to carry out their duties in a pro competitive manner while safeguarding and advancing the Company’s interests.

By using more efficient and innovative processing methods and technologies, we are reducing the amount of energy, water and raw materials we use to make our products, thereby minimizing the amount of waste we generate.

We go to great lengths to ensure that our products are designed and made in a safe, effective and environmentally sound manner.

We deliver on this commitment by maintaining a highly trained and capable scientific staff, and by actively pursuing manufacturing process improvements that minimize environmental impacts.

We have set environmental sustainability goals with concrete targets and timelines to demonstrate this commitment.

To ensure that our knowledge stays current with that of thought leaders and experts in the industry, we also collaborate with external resources and industry groups, such as the American Chemical Society (ACS), the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) and Animal Health Europe (AHE).

We conduct extensive testing of our products to identify and understand any potential safety, health and environmental hazards.

We manage and communicate information about hazardous materials to keep our employees, contractors, transporters and other partners safe.

We are actively engaged in conversations on product stewardship to understand and act on the issues specific to our industry worldwide.

We share best practices within the industry via our membership in the Conference Board Product Stewardship Council, the American Chemistry Council’s (ACC) Green Chemistry Initiative, the EFPIA, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA) and the ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable (ACS GCIPR).

Our objective is to maintain compliance and assure supply of lifesaving medicines as we look to further minimize our future environmental footprint.

Our Company also supports the development of science based, cost effective and environmentally sound programs that promote the proper disposal of unused medicines and their packaging in accordance with regional requirements.

For more information, see our position statement on the responsible disposal of medicines, which can be found on our corporate website.

Our efforts in this area are overseen by our Green Sustainable Science Steering Committee and our Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Council.

Our chemists and engineers are trained in green design principles and are provided with tools and resources to help them develop manufacturing processes that use safer chemicals and reduced quantities of raw materials.

We use innovations like nanotechnology to make our products more effective, while ensuring that product safety always remains of utmost importance.

Complying with chemical substance and product requirements is a top priority for us.

We track numerous existing and emerging chemical control regulations that require us to register specific types of chemicals with the proper authorities.

To meet these requirements, our scientists complete assessments of the environmental and human health risks of the substances with which we work and submit the required regulatory notifications.

Additionally, we provide details on product use and risk based control measures in accordance with applicable regulations.

Our product stewardship program extends to our customers and patients through the design of effective, low impact product packaging.

These packaging materials serve a range of important purposes the foremost is to protect the purity, efficacy and physical integrity of the products that reach our patients.

Packaging also helps ensure our products are used safely, conveniently and with adherence.

Prescribing and educational information is conveyed at the point of purchase and packaging can include child resistant access, tamper evident features and anti counterfeiting features.

In addition to these critical packaging functions, we recognize the environmental impact of our packaging.

After it has served its critical functions, packaging becomes our patient or caregiver’s waste and therefore must be accounted for.

We are actively re imagining our approach to reducing the environmental impact of our packaging.

We have developed a long term roadmap to fundamentally change our business processes, including better prediction, quantification and verification of impact to drive changes in product, packaging and supply chain designs.

We intend to integrate this roadmap into our ways of working, and ultimately use it to reduce our environmental impact.

A foundational part of our path forward includes evolving how we measure and maintain packaging data to enable transparent, data driven decision making.

Minimization or elimination of materials of concern.

Introducing more recycled content into our packaging.

Increasing the recyclability of our packaging systems.

We continue to use a simplified life cycle analysis tool as a standard business practice.

All new human health packaging designs are reviewed in the development process to understand and minimize environmental impacts as much as possible, while still providing adequate protection for our products.

We continue to monitor global trends around packaging and packaging materials, and work to incorporate circular economy concepts into the critical functions of packaging for pharmaceuticals.

Environmental packaging is managed by the Global Pharmaceutical Commercialization and Global Pharmaceutical Operations areas of the Company with oversight from our Environmental Health and Safety Council.

A comprehensive and effective chemical management program is critical to the safety and protection of our employees, the communities in which we operate, and the environment.

In 2022, we responded to the CDP forest questionnaire for timber products, specifically for paper and secondary and tertiary packaging.

CDP graded our disclosure with a C Awareness rating, indicating that we have Knowledge of impacts on, and of, forests issues .

According to CDP, our Company is among 57 percent of companies that reached Awareness level in our Activity Group (Biotech and pharma) for timber.

We performed a gap assessment of our questionnaire response and developed a roadmap for improvements in this area over the next several years.

We are in the early stages of our program development and are in the process of assessing the impact of other forest risk commodities.

Solvents play a key role in the research and manufacturing of our products, as well as in equipment cleaning.

Because of their significance to our business and the life cycle impact they represent, we focus on designing our processes to minimize or avoid their use where practical.

Where we do use solvents, we maximize efficiency and control them in our emissions, effluents and waste.

We have an active Green and Sustainable Science program (see page 28) to design our new processes using fewer, less toxic solvents and other hazardous materials, and to reuse and recycle more of the solvents we do use.

For cleaning our manufacturing equipment, we use water based methods where they are as effective as solvents.

At each of our manufacturing sites, we have engineers who are responsible for identifying and driving process improvement projects.

When it is not practical to reuse regenerated solvents in our own production processes, we work with suppliers who recover the spent solvents for resale to other industries or safely burn them as a source of energy, where feasible.

Any used solvents that leave our site as hazardous waste are managed at off site facilities that are on our list of approved waste management sites.

We have put in place procedures, systems and processes to manage the approval, procurement, inventory, receipt, transfer, storage, use and disposal of chemicals at all of our sites.

We provide our employees and others with information about the identities and potential hazards of the chemicals in our operations and final products through proper labeling of chemicals and the creation of safety data sheets.

Green and sustainable science is the development and application of green chemistry principles and quantitative sustainability metrics and goals to the process of scientific inquiry.

Our Company employs this framework because we recognize that our ability to meet our environmental sustainability goals is intrinsically linked to the creation of innovative and cost efficient manufacturing processes with low environmental impact.

Green and sustainable commercial chemical route development also helps to mitigate potential issues in the supply chain of tomorrow by reducing our raw material requirements today.

Our Company’s objective in this space is to be the industry leader for the development of innovative, efficient, green and sustainable commercial syntheses of our small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) from sustainable commodity raw materials.

We are also exploring ways to reduce the environmental impact of biologics and vaccine manufacturing.

Our integrated strategy involves several stages and aims to provide innovative solutions rather than incremental improvements to historical practices.

We aim to develop the most efficient and sustainable processes at product launch, with the goal of minimizing material use and waste from our commercial manufacturing.

Our Company utilizes an innovative green by design development strategy to progress from an initial early clinical supply route to a fully optimized and sustainable commercial manufacturing process.

As part of our Green Sustainable Science program, we calculate the process mass intensity (PMI) of our small molecule human health products.

PMI represents the number of kilograms of raw materials (including water) used to produce one kilogram of an API, and indicates the efficiency by which we convert raw materials into final products.

We use this metric internally to compare different manufacturing methods, identify process improvement opportunities and track our progress.

We have developed a SMART (in Silico MSD Aspirational Research Tool) PMI tool which provides ambitious, molecule aware PMI targets for our API manufacturing processes.

We routinely evaluate PMI at every stage to drive the development of all our new small molecule processes to achieve our aspirational goals for green and sustainable processes.

For our large molecule processes, we are pioneering new modality appropriate metrics which outperform PMI in their ability to recommend ways of reducing the environmental impact of biologics and vaccine manufacturing.

We are also using streamlined life cycle analysis tools to further evaluate the environmental impacts of our processes.

We are a founding member of the American Chemical Society's (ACS) Green Chemistry Institute (GCI) Pharmaceutical Roundtable, a partnership between the ACS GCI and member pharmaceutical companies.

The Roundtable drives the advancement of education and research on new ways to apply green and sustainable science to pharmaceutical discovery and manufacturing.

This is done through the development of industry wide sustainability metrics, tools and technologies.

Since the establishment of the Green Chemistry Challenge Awards by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the American Chemistry Society (ACS) in 1996, we have been recognized with nine Green Chemistry Awards for innovative process improvements with six of those consecutively since 2017.

The Green Chemistry Challenge Awards have been sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and or ACS, and we are proud to have been recognized.

In 2022, we were recognized for developing a greener process to manufacture our investigational antiviral COVID 19 medicine.

Lastly, our Company has been honored by ACS as the winner of the Peter J. Dunn Award for Green Chemistry Engineering Impact in the Pharmaceutical Industry for the last three years.

Learn more about the Green Chemistry Awards and how we are safeguarding the environment through green chemistry on our corporate website.

We recognize the important role we play in identifying, adapting and responding to the public health risks associated with climate change, such as threats to clean air and water, insufficient food supplies and the spread of disease.

Our longstanding support of stronger health systems in underserved areas is even more important given the evidence that certain disease patterns are associated with changing climate conditions.

Energy demand reduction and the utilization of renewable energy are an essential part of our climate mitigation strategy, as it positively impacts our efforts to reduce our direct GHG emissions.

We have established internal policies and practices focused on reducing energy use at our sites.

We will achieve this by optimizing systems and equipment, consolidating excess facility space when possible and designing with the environment in mind.

In addition, we have launched initiatives to understand and reduce our supply chain related impacts.

By taking these steps, we are not only minimizing GHG emissions but also reducing our operating costs and mitigating the business impacts associated with climate change.

Our manufacturing facilities, warehouses, laboratories, offices and vehicle fleet are the primary targets of our energy demand reduction programs, as they represent the majority of our energy consumption.

Our Global Energy Sustainability Center of Excellence (CoE) supports sites by providing them with tools, best practices and access to funding for energy saving projects.

For further information on our Sustainability Capital Fund, please see GRI 201 2 on page 52.

To support our sites’ energy reduction plans, we have created a Low Carbon Transition Playbook (LCTP).

The LCTP was the result of a cross functional effort at our Company that pulled together experts into a design thinking workshop organized to develop strategies to reduce GHG emissions.

The LCTP includes a gap assessment for sites to evaluate the maturity of their energy programs and helps create short and long term plans to reduce sites’ carbon intensity and build toward a low carbon future.

We have committed to sourcing 100 percent of our purchased electricity from renewable energy by 2025.

Photovoltaic (PV) arrays, wind turbines and other renewable energy installations avoid emissions, help reduce energy demand peaks and postpone or preclude adding new power plants.

We continually look for opportunities for new on site installations, vendor supplied renewable energy through the electrical grid and virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) and power purchase agreement (PPA) projects.

All new laboratories, offices and major renovations are built following cost effective and energy efficient practices, and are designed to meet the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, or a comparable country standard (e.g.

Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method BREEAM , Excellence in Energy Efficiency Design EXEED , Haute Qualit Environnementale HQE , etc.).

Offices and laboratories are expected to achieve LEED Gold certification at a minimum.

Construction at our sites over the past few years has resulted in two recent laboratories receiving LEED gold ratings, one in the U.S. and one in Europe.

As of early 2023, our continued efforts at renewable energy procurement since 2019 have resulted in a total of 208 MW of VPPA and PPA commitments.

In addition to these commitments, a 7.3 MW solar PV array installation was completed at a site in Ireland in 2022.

This array is providing 20.6 percent of the total site demand.

Approximately seven percent of our total energy use is associated with our vehicle fleet.

We have a roadmap to transition to a full battery electric vehicle (BEV) fleet.

The implementation depends on the availability of like for like electric vehicles (EV) and the development of public charging infrastructure.

Our current emphasis includes introducing hybrid vehicles as a bridge in Latin America and Asia Pacific Japan (APJ), deploying EVs in mature European, Middle Eastern and African (EMEA) markets, and starting EV pilots in North America.

Currently, these vehicles account for 18 percent of our fleet in EMEA 59 percent in APJ and 1 percent in Latin America and North America.

However, the worldwide vehicle supply shortage has slowed our transition.

Note: We have defined purchased electricity as electricity sourced from external suppliers as well as renewable electricity that was generated and utilized on site where we retained the renewable attributes or where we have obtained renewable attributes through contract.

In 2022, our sites’ fuel usage and purchased electricity consumption increased due to capital expansion, but our purchased steam and biomass consumption decreased due to boiler efficiency initiatives.

In March 2023, the U.S. EPA again recognized our Company with our 16th consecutive Sustained Excellence Award.

This is also the 18th consecutive year in which we have been recognized by ENERGY STAR for excellence in energy management.

In 2023, we continued to successfully use ENERGY STAR benchmarking tools such as the ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager to obtain the ENERGY STAR Certified Building label for four buildings.

Our Puerto Rico facility was awarded the ENERGY STAR Pharma Energy Performance Indicator (EPI) for superior energy efficiency and environmental performance among U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturing plants for the 14th consecutive year.

Our global water strategy aims to achieve sustainable water management within our operations and our supply chain, which supports UN SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.

Ensuring that our wastewater discharges comply with local and national standards, as well as internal requirements.

Understanding and controlling our operational water footprint.

Managing water risk at our facilities and in our supply chain.

In our Business Partner Code of Conduct, we request that suppliers conserve natural resources and engage in activities aimed at reducing water usage.

We also ask that they have systems in place to quantify the amount of water used.

For more information on supplier engagement on water related topics, please see.

Each site is responsible for management of water resources.

Water management is overseen globally by the Water Center of Excellence (CoE).

This CoE reviews water data to monitor sites’ progress and provides assistance as needed to support sites’ work towards meeting our goals.

The Environmental Review Committee provides oversight in establishing our internal Environmental Quality Criteria (EQC) standards.

For more detailed information on our environmental management and governance, please see the Environmental Health and Safety Management and Governance document on the Sustainability Resources page on our corporate website.

We have established water goals to help us manage water related risks in our operations.

We will maintain global water use at or below 2015 levels.

We have endorsed the UN CEO Water Mandate, a public commitment to adopt and implement a comprehensive approach to water management, and we have aligned our water program with its principles.

CEO Water Mandate endorsers have a responsibility to make water resource management a priority and to work with governments, UN agencies, NGOs, local communities and other interested parties to address global water challenges.

We continue to work to identify partnerships that will help us advance our water stewardship priorities in the areas in which we operate.

These projects also support the goals of SDG 15, which strives to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems.

We report our water security annually through CDP.

In 2022, CDP graded our disclosure with a B management rating, indicating that we provide evidence of actions associated with good environmental management and are taking coordinated action on water security.

In 2022, through The Nature Conservancy (TNC) we supported the implementation of green stormwater infrastructure projects in the Delaware River watershed.

This was done in collaboration with private, community based landowners such as affordable housing providers, schools and social service institutions, along with the Philadelphia Water Department.

The project aims to reduce stormwater runoff and improve water quality to help make the Delaware River and its tributaries more swimmable, fishable and drinkable for millions of residents in the region.

Green stormwater infrastructure presents an attractive and effective water quality solution using tangible, on the ground, nature based projects rain gardens, permeable pavements, green roofs, pocket parks, planters and other water slowing, natural solutions to keep stormwater runoff out of sewer systems, rivers and streams while adding safe, beautiful, green spaces to communities.

The contribution to TNC will support the design and implementation of projects across multiple blocks in the city that will filter stormwater pollution, restore urban habitat, create new green spaces, and provide many other layered benefits to residents.

Our West Point, Pennsylvania facility is located within the Delaware River watershed and this project demonstrates our commitment to collective action in the catchments where our manufacturing sites operate.

As a result of COVID related delays, the project is taking place in 2023.

In 2021, through TNC, we supported a watershed conservation project in Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, Brazil with a 100,000 contribution to the Belo Horizonte Water fund, led by the Agencia Peixe Vivo.

As a result of COVID related delays, the project was completed in 2022.

This TNC sponsored project promotes governance strengthening of local partners to enable the restoration of native forest, implement soil conservation techniques, make improvements to dirt roads and conserve existing forests in the Juramento River watershed.

The Juramento River is a source of potable water for the City of Montes Claros, and the water security at our manufacturing operations in Montes Claros is directly impacted by this project.

Creating a more stable outflow of water over the course of the year.

Access to clean water is critical for human health and is a key input to our manufacturing operations.

We assess water risk throughout our network as a standard business practice.

The World Resource Institute’s (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool is used as an initial step to map water risk.

Sites are categorized annually using the Baseline Water Stress indicator, which is the ratio of total annual water withdrawals to total annual renewable supply and accounts for upstream consumptive use.

Higher stress values indicate more competition among water users.

Water conservation plans are put in place at high risk sites that use more than 100,000m3 of water per year.

We work with a third party water use expert to evaluate opportunities for water use reductions at these sites, resulting in site specific water conservation plans.

Performing this assessment ensures that we can adapt our strategy to changing stressors in each catchment.

It enables us to better prioritize facilities and catchments for water stewardship activities and lays the foundation for potential future water targets in priority locations.

In 2022, the WRI tool identified four of our manufacturing and or research facilities as being in areas with extremely high Baseline Water Stress, and 12 as being in areas with high Baseline Water Stress.

In 2022, there were two more sites in areas of extremely high and four more sites in high risk than in 2021 due to sites coming in and out of the network.

As a result of the above methodology, we continue to have two sites that have water conservation plans in place.

The sites that use the most water in our network are located in the U.S. Of these, two are in areas of high Baseline Water Stress according to the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool but, through the assessment process described above, are considered medium risk.

We conduct environmental risk assessments on our products (small molecules, biologics and vaccines) from the development phase through product launch, to understand and manage product impacts both from manufacturing and patient use.

We assess products in a manner consistent with the most stringent applicable global regulations, including the regulatory review processes of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.

Product environmental safety profiles are reassessed during periodic renewals of product filings, and risk mitigation actions are implemented when needed.

We use the information from our risk assessments to establish or update our internal, compound specific EQCs, which are used to confirm that wastewater discharged from our facilities does not contain levels of residual products that present a risk to human health or the environment.

Our manufacturing facilities are required to use these EQCs, along with industry accepted risk assessment methods, to establish procedures for managing and controlling active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in their wastewater.

Assess the potential risk from its operations using science based and industry accepted risk assessment methods.

Minimize environmental impacts from wastewater discharges in the local watershed.

Establish procedures for managing, treating or controlling APIs in wastewater prior to discharge where needed.

Our facilities have, or will be provided with, API treatment technology such as advanced oxidation where needed, so that our wastewater discharges meet both regulatory requirements and these internal standards.

We also provide wastewater discharge criteria to suppliers that manufacture pharmaceutical compounds for us and have initiated detailed assessments of our suppliers to better understand and address potential impacts.

As a member of the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Alliance and signatory to the Industry Roadmap for Progress on Combating AMR, we are working to deliver on our commitments to reduce the environmental impacts from antibiotic residues in wastewater through implementation of the AMR Alliance Common Antibiotic Manufacturing Framework.

We have reviewed the operations of our human health antibiotic manufacturing facilities and third party human health antibiotic suppliers to assess their wastewater treatment controls.

We have developed a mechanism for transparently demonstrating that our supply chain meets the standards in this framework, which was presented in the AMR Industry Alliance Progress Report.

We participate in efforts to address water discharge related impacts with various organizations, including the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).

The EFPIA, Medicines for Europe and the Association of the European Self Medication Industry (AESGP) have worked together to develop the Eco Pharmaco Stewardship (EPS) initiative.

The EPS initiative considers the environmental impacts of a medicine throughout its entire life cycle, and addresses the roles and responsibilities of all parties in managing those impacts.

This includes public services, the pharmaceutical industry, environmental experts, doctors, pharmacists and patients.

These goals were developed to align with the latest climate science and address the rising expectations of our customers, investors, external stakeholders and employees regarding the environmental impact of our operations and supply chain.

Reduce our operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e., Scopes 1 2) 46% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline.

In March 2023, in alignment with the Paris Agreement on climate change and in accordance with our commitment to operating responsibly, we committed to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) to set a net zero target for greenhouse gas emissions across our global operations (Scopes 1, 2 and 3).

We have committed to becoming carbon neutral across our operations (Scopes 1 2 GHG emissions) by 2025, to reduce our Scopes 1 2 GHG emissions 46 percent by 2030 from a 2019 baseline (including biogenic emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks), and to reduce our value chain (Scope 3 GHG emissions) 30 percent by 2030, also from a 2019 baseline.

These reduction targets have been verified by the SBTi.

We seek to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations with ongoing innovation to increase energy efficiency, applying sustainable building standards and continuing to transition away from fossil fuel use.

Remaining Scope 1 emissions will be balanced each year by investing in high quality carbon offsets, including carbon removal offsets.

We continue to find ways to decrease energy demand and have increased the amount of renewable energy we purchase.

Our procurement team is engaging our strategic suppliers in our efforts to reduce the environmental impacts within our supply chain.

In our Business Partner Code of Conduct, we request that suppliers conserve energy and engage in activities aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Reduce our value chain (Scope 3) GHG emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline.

Source 100% of our purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.

Achieve carbon neutrality across our operations by 2025 (Scopes 1 2 emissions).

Any remaining emissions will be offset with high quality offsets in 2025.

We have committed to sourcing 100 percent of our purchased electricity from renewable energy by 2025.

This target will help us reduce our Scope 2 emissions and meet our Scopes 1 2 reduction goal.

We ensure our ongoing commitment to these areas through thoughtful governance.

The Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Council, which comprises top level executives from throughout the Company, provides enterprise leadership and sponsorship for our environmental sustainability strategy.

The EHS Council monitors progress towards our public targets, influences decisions for environmental sustainability strategy implementation, and also increases visibility and transparency internally to the business, Executive Team and the Board of Directors.

Our internal Environmental Sustainability Implementation Steering Committee also comprises top level executives from throughout the Company, oversees progress of initiatives at the enterprise level, and provides support and guidance on the implementation plans and resourcing of our environmental sustainability strategy globally.

This steering committee is informed by leaders from the Environmental Sustainability Center of Excellence (CoE), Global Energy Sustainability CoE and Energy Procurement CoE, who develop our goals in alignment with stakeholder expectations, track their progress, and develop and provide continuous improvement on plans to achieve and sustain our public commitments.

Each site is responsible for the management of its energy use.

In many cases, we also partner with our third party Integrated Facility Management (IFM) providers to manage energy use and work toward achieving the corporate goals.

In 2022, we conducted a climate policy alignment assessment of the trade associations referenced in GRI 2 23 on page 42 by determining whether they had publicly disclosed formal positions on climate change and, if so, reviewing those positions in the context of our Company’s own position on climate change.

This assessment can be found on the Sustainability Resources page on our corporate website.

Our Company is performing a high level qualitative physical and transitional climate risk and opportunity scenario assessment aligned with the framework created by the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

For more information regarding TCFD, please see GRI 201 2 on page 52.

ERM CVS provided limited assurance of select 2022 greenhouse gas and water data included in this report and submitted to CDP.

To view the ERM CVS limited assurance statement for our environmental data, please visit the Sustainability Resources page of our corporate website.

The limited assurance engagement was performed in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000.

Adjustments also reflect changes in methodology to ensure consistency from year to year, including Scope 2 emission factor updates E GRID (2022), IEA (2022), EU Residual (2022), UK Defra (2022) Inventarios Corporativos (2022) and Scope 1 3 emission factor updates EPA Climate Leaders (2022) .

The World Resource Institute’s Greenhouse Gas Protocol defines Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as direct emissions from owned or controlled sources such as on site fuel combustion and fleet vehicles.

Scope 2 GHG emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy consumed by the reporting company.

Scope 3 GHG emissions include all other indirect emissions in a company’s value chain.

Only those facilities over which our Company has operational control are included in the GHG inventory.

We assumed that all downstream material would first have been stored, transported and handled upstream.

This category currently includes the impacts of our Animal Health products ENGEMYCIN (oxytetracycline), NEO SPRAY CAF (oxytetracyclinum), OXYTETRIN LA (oxytetracycline) only.

Packaging material data was used with the U.S. EPA’s WARM Model.

The total reported for Category 6 includes non primary travel vendor data emissions which were based on our 2022 third party spend data and an Economic Input Output Model performed by Climate Earth, Inc. 2021 reimbursable mileage data was used as a proxy for the 2022 calculations.

From 2021 to 2022, our combined year over year Scope 1 and market based Scope 2 GHG emissions remained about the same.

While we implemented several projects that reduced our GHG emissions, we also experienced capital expansion, which resulted in no net reduction in GHG emissions from the last year.

We have analyzed and reported our Scope 3 impacts using primary activity data and accepted emission factors in addition to an economic input output model based on our third party spend.

In 2022, our Scope 3 GHG emissions decreased as compared to 2021.

While performance was mixed across our reported categories, a decrease in our largest category, Purchased Goods and Services, led to an overall decrease from 2021.

Our analysis shows that our Scope 3 GHG emissions impacts are nearly seven times greater than our combined Scopes 1 2 emissions.

We are working to reduce those impacts through activities such as reducing waste in our operations, creating more sustainable packaging, and changing the way we commute to work and travel for business.

We are also engaging with our strategic suppliers to identify ways to reduce GHG emissions in our supply chain.

These actions not only reduce our environmental impact, but also benefit the business by reducing costs.

We report our GHG emissions as required by regulations in certain countries and annually through CDP Climate.

In 2022, CDP graded our disclosure as a B or a rating of management, indicating that we are taking coordinated action on climate issues.

Our CDP Climate Change Questionnaire is available on CDP's website.

Corporate policy: Respect for Environmental Health and Safety.

We are committed to controlling air emissions from our facilities to reduce local, regional and global environmental impacts.

Air emissions are generated by our manufacturing and research operations, as well as by burning fuel in on site equipment and fleet vehicles.

Our Air Management Standard requires our facilities to quantify and control air emissions to comply with both applicable regulations and emission standards.

Where regulations do not mandate emission quantification, our facilities are required to use guidelines and tools associated with Air Management Standard to estimate emissions.

These guidelines and tools were developed using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) emission calculation methodologies.

Any increase in production can negatively impact our emissions trends.

While there are efforts to minimize solvent use in production, solvents are needed for cleaning and disinfecting purposes.

As we transform from manufacturing of pharmaceuticals to biopharmaceuticals, mandatory cleaning and disinfection protocols associated with biologics and vaccines are increasing solvent based emissions.

The Montreal Protocol mandates phase out of refrigerants that are ozone depleting substances (ODS) per schedules approved for individual countries.

Our facilities strive to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements that have been established in accordance with each country’s commitments.

Our Air Center of Excellence (CoE) provides assistance as needed to our facilities to obtain appropriate environmental permits, and to quantify and control air emissions to comply with applicable regulations and emission standards.

Many of our pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, cleaning disinfection operations and research laboratories require the use of solvents.

Evaporation of solvents into the air is our primary source of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.

In an effort to reduce VOCs, reductions in solvent usage has been incorporated as an element of our Green Sustainable Science program.

Key elements of the program include designing efficient processes that use fewer and less hazardous organic solvents, and using water based methods for cleaning our process equipment where they are equally effective as solvent based methods.

To reduce emissions from processes where organic solvents are used, we use pollution control technologies such as conservation vents, carbon filters, thermal oxidizers, condensers and scrubbers.

For more information on this program, please see GRI 301 on page 84.

Air emissions are also generated by burning fuel in our boilers and power generation turbines (for heat and energy), and by other combustion processes such as thermal oxidizers (for treating air emissions) and incinerators (for destroying waste).

Our fleet vehicles and aircraft also burn fuel and generate air emissions.

These combustion processes result in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx) and VOCs.

We strive to make our facilities more energy efficient through our energy management programs and to improve the fuel efficiency of our fleet vehicles.

Our company’s actions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to meet our public climate commitments will also result in a reduction of NOx, SOx and VOC emissions.

The increase in NOx and SOx emissions from 2021 to 2022 is a result of the combination of multiple factors, including an increase in the use of jets compared to pre pandemic levels, an increase in the combustion of diesel fuel at a couple of our facilities (addressing a power failure due to a hurricane and a natural gas curtailment during winter), more accurate emission tracking methods and variations in energy needs at multiple facilities.

VOC emissions decreased from 2021 to 2022 due to variations in production, replacement of solvent based cleaning with water based cleaning at one of our facilities, and data collection improvements with the adoption of more accurate emission tracking methods.

Emissions of ozone depleting substances are the result of non routine releases from temperature control and fire suppression systems and can vary from year to year.

Note: Previously reported data have been restated per our methodology, which includes adding facilities that have been acquired and removing facilities that have been sold or spun off.

The proper management of waste from our facilities is important to the communities in which we operate and is a focus of our environmental permits and other regulatory requirements.

Our waste management standard requires our facilities to comply with applicable generation, management and disposal regulations and standards.

To minimize our environmental footprint and align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we look for opportunities to avoid the use of hazardous materials, to reuse or recycle materials and to prevent the generation of waste.

When prevention, reuse and recycling are not practical or feasible, we apply controls and treatment technologies to prevent human health impacts and minimize environmental impacts.

Waste management is overseen globally by our Waste and Dangerous Goods Center of Excellence (CoE).

Each site is responsible for the management of its waste.

In many cases, we partner with our third party Integrated Facility Management (IFM) partners to manage site waste and work toward realizing the waste goals.

The amount of waste we generate reflects the efficiency of our manufacturing processes.

Waste minimization begins with the evaluation of our product designs and manufacturing processes.

Through our Green Sustainable Science program (see GRI 301 on page 84), we design processes that use safer chemicals, consume less energy, use less water and other resources, and generate less waste.

Our process development biologists, chemists and engineers have the expertise to create more sustainable ways to make our products.

We continuously strive to reduce the amount of operational waste we generate and to maximize the use of environmentally beneficial disposal methods such as recycling, composting and waste to energy.

To ensure our waste is managed in an environmentally responsible manner, we use only approved waste disposal facilities.

Approved facilities demonstrate that they have the systems, technologies and practices to manage our waste streams responsibly and in compliance with all applicable requirements.

We routinely audit these facilities to verify the acceptability of their systems and practices.

Waste types are defined differently in various parts of the world.

Hazardous waste: Highly regulated or high risk waste streams that need to be neutralized, treated or destroyed to address a particular hazard such as toxicity, flammability, corrosivity, radioactivity, pharmaceutically active or infectious.

Non hazardous waste: Includes all other operational waste.

The amount of construction project related waste can vary significantly from year to year based on the number and size of projects.

Therefore, our definition of operational waste does not include construction or demolition waste from construction projects.

Over the past few years, a number of countries in Asia have enacted legislation restricting the acceptance of solid waste from other countries.

Historically, a large percentage of recyclable waste collected in the U.S. has been shipped to Asia for recycling, so this change had and continues to have the potential to affect the percentage of our non hazardous waste sent for recycling.

The amount of our non hazardous waste sent for recycling decreased by three percentage points from 2021 to 2022.

In 2022, two of the Company's largest sites sending non hazardous waste to landfills implemented diversion strategies to reduce the volume of waste going to landfill by 60 percent.

We also allocated approximately 142,000 to additional waste projects through the Sustainability Capital Fund.

The majority of this funding supported the installation at one facility of a biodigester that uses bacteria to break down organic waste matter.

The remainder was used to support water diversion awareness with AI sorting technology.

Potential waste related impacts are also associated with upstream activities such as external manufacturing of active ingredients, the purchase of raw materials and goods, and the return of off spec product.

Similarly, the impacts downstream of the packaging and waste generated from the use of our products is estimated in our Scope 3 GHG emissions.

For more information on our GHG emissions, please refer to section GRI 305 on page 101.

While we may not be in full control of the waste generated in our value chain, we pursue various initiatives to reduce the impact through our product and material choices.

According to our Business Partner Code of Conduct, partners shall operate in an environmentally responsible and efficient manner to minimize adverse impacts on the environment.

Partners are encouraged to conserve natural resources, to avoid the use of hazardous materials where possible and to engage in activities that reuse and recycle.

For more information on our environmental management with suppliers, please see.

By 2025, no more than 20% of our global operational waste will be sent to landfills and incinerators (without energy recovery).

By 2025, at least 50% of our sites will send zero waste to landfills.

Therefore, to be consistent with the definition for generator of record, we do not track operational waste beyond the initial waste treatment facility.

The waste directed to this disposal technology was previously classified as incineration without energy recovery, but with this updated information it has been reclassified as incineration with energy recovery as per our internal definitions.

Only the 2022 reporting year reflects this reclassification.

Reporting for the years prior to 2022 with this reclassification will be included in the 2023 2024 Impact Report.

Therefore, to be consistent with the definition for generator of record, we do not track operational waste beyond the initial waste treatment facility.

Only the 2022 reporting year reflects this reclassification.

Reporting for the years prior to 2022 with this reclassification will be included in the 2023 2024 Impact Report.

Approximately 14 percent of our hazardous waste was sent offsite for recycling and was either returned to us for reuse or sold to other industries.

This is a decrease from the 19 percent that was recycled Company wide in 2021, and is attributed to reduced production at one of our manufacturing facilities that is in the process of being closed.

Another 60 percent was burned to generate power, up from 28 percent in 2021.

About 19 percent of the total hazardous waste generated was incinerated without energy recovery, down from 44 percent in 2021 due to a reclassification based on new information as explained in footnote 2 on the previous page.

Less than one percent was sent to hazardous waste landfills.

Therefore, to be consistent with the definition for generator of record, we do not track operational waste beyond the initial waste treatment facility.

In 2022, 16 percent of our non hazardous waste was composted, a decrease from 19 percent in the previous year.

Approximately 39 percent of our non hazardous waste was sent offsite for recycling, a decrease from 42 percent in 2021.

Another 29 percent was burned to generate power, up from 22 percent in 2021.

A contributor to this increase included one of the Company's largest sites generating non hazardous waste to landfill transitioning a portion of its waste from landfill to energy recovery.

About 3 percent of the total non hazardous waste generated was incinerated without energy recovery (unchanged from 2021), and 10 percent was sent to non hazardous waste landfills, down from 12 percent in 2021.

Therefore, to be consistent with the definition for generator of record, we do not track operational waste beyond the initial waste treatment facility.

The waste directed to this disposal technology was previously classified as incineration without energy recovery, but with this updated information it has been reclassified incineration with energy recovery as per our internal definitions.

Only the 2022 reporting year reflects this reclassification in this Impact Report.

Reporting for the years prior to 2022 with this reclassification will be included in the 2023 2024 Impact Report.

In 2022, we managed 83,333 metric tons of waste from our operations, a two percent increase from 2021.

Of this total, 48,540 metric tons were hazardous waste.

Of the hazardous waste we generated in 2022, 75 percent was beneficially reused (reused, recycled, composted or sent for energy recovery), up from 50 percent in 2021 (see footnote 2 of the table above for explanation of these changes).

We beneficially reused 87 percent of the 34,793 metric tons of nonhazardous waste we generated in 2022.

We are evaluating and refining the programs currently in place at our manufacturing, research and office sites to reduce waste generation and increase recycling.

Approximately 49 percent of our facilities sent zero operational waste to landfill in 2022, down from 52 percent in 2021.

The decrease was due to additional sites coming into the network.

Year over year, there was no net change in the number of sites that sent zero operational waste to landfill.

The overall percentage of waste sent to landfill decreased from five percent in 2021 to four percent in 2022.

We continue to work to identify alternate methods of waste management that will reduce the amount of waste sent to incinerators (without energy recovery) and landfills.

We do not collect data on the amount of product accepted for takeback, reuse or disposal.

Environmental sustainability principles are integrated into each stage of our supplier management program.

Our Global Supplier Management Group (GSMG) drives the program and maintains the associated standards and processes by which suppliers are identified, qualified and managed.

The environmental sustainability program is an essential element of supplier management along with social responsibility, economic inclusion and supplier diversity (EI SD).

Please visit GRI 2 6 on page 35, GRI 204 on page 77 and GRI 414 on page 145 for additional information regarding our integrated approach with our suppliers.

External manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished products are screened for environmental health and safety (EHS) compliance, in addition to quality, supply and technical competence requirements.

The EHS screening and on site assessment is led by GSMG and Global Safety and the Environment (GSE), and includes a survey covering such topics as regulatory compliance, fatalities and major incidents.

Based on the screening results and activities undertaken by the supplier, certain external manufacturers are subject to a more detailed on site assessment conducted by a multidisciplinary team, which may include our Quality, GSE, Global Technical Operations and GSMG representatives.

The external manufacturers with whom we contract are periodically reassessed using a risk based approach higher risk external manufacturers are subject to more frequent on site assessments.

We expect that observations made during the EHS assessment process will be remediated by our external manufacturers, and we monitor and track corrective and preventative actions (CAPAs) through completion.

Since 2020, the EHS assessment schedule has been negatively impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic.

Beginning in Q2 2022, EHS assessments have been primarily completed in person.

However, some assessments were completely virtual or a combination thereof.

While introductory goals were established in 2017, our Company continues to work to improve how we partner with our third parties to drive improved environmental sustainability throughout our supply chain.

Hiring, retaining and developing strong leadership is one of our Company’s top goals.

We know that diverse teams thrive and contribute to our Company’s overall success.

In 2022, 52 percent of all hires globally were female while in the U.S., 47 percent were from underrepresented ethnic groups.

We provide our managers and external recruiting organizations with the tools they need in order to succeed in mitigating unconscious biases throughout the hiring process.

We employ a targeted communication strategy with marketing, social media and alliances that reach broad and diverse pools of talent.

Despite lingering pandemic fears, 2022 continued to show significant hiring growth in many of our regions including the U.S., our largest volume hiring market.

We also saw hiring growth in Europe and Asia Pacific.

This global growth is largely due to investments in sales, clinical trials, IT, and digital and analytics.

As a result of the global pandemic, China’s 2022 hire rate decreased due to lockdowns and restrictions in the country.

Our hiring strategy in the region continues to focus on securing digital, analytical and automation skill sets across all divisions, especially in Oncology and Vaccines in Global Human Health and in our R D division.

As a global health care company, we strive to provide a safe and healthy workplace.

We seek to reduce environmental, health and safety (EHS) risks in order to eliminate work related injuries, illnesses and unplanned events from all aspects of our operations through a comprehensive EHS program.

We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace that complies with all applicable safety laws and regulations.

In addition, we aim for EHS performance that is among the best in the pharmaceutical industry.

All employees, service providers and Company managed contractors must follow the standards and requirements in our EHS management system.

Compliance with these requirements is measured through site audit processes and through peer reviews for construction.

Each year, we set targets and track leading and lagging safety metrics.

These metrics include safety observations, near miss incidents, peer safety reviews, Recordable Injury Rates (RIR), Lost Time Injury Rates (LTIR) and Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (DART) rates.

For consistency across the Company, and to enable us to compare our injury rates with those of other multinational companies, we use the U.S. based OSHA recordkeeping criteria for recording and tracking work related injuries and illnesses.

We require all injuries, illnesses and incidents involving our employees to be reported and investigated to determine their cause.

We also require corrective and preventative actions be taken to prevent recurrence.

Please see GRI 403 9 and GRI 403 10 on pages 126 129 for our performance on these metrics.

Our Company’s EHS management system includes comprehensive programs focused on reducing risks, work related injuries illnesses and other safety incidents from our operations.

We focus on safe facility design, process controls, operation and maintenance procedures, protection systems and emergency response capabilities.

Our EHS Management System supports our Company’s objectives by promoting a strong EHS culture through visible leadership, active employee engagement and a focus on proactive identification and elimination of hazards.

Our Employee Safety Committees demonstrate this EHS engagement in action.

These Committees include workers and management in a partnership to proactively address EHS issues.

While we have reviewed the ISO 18001 Standard, we have not pursued certification because we believe that our current EHS management systems are robust and achieve our desired levels of EHS performance.

We identify work related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non routine basis and apply the hierarchy of controls in order to eliminate hazards and minimize risks.

We continually evaluate and work to improve our occupational health and safety management system.

Our process safety program identifies, controls and manages risks associated with the manufacturing and handling of our human and animal health products.

The program applies to operations that are subject to process safety regulations, and to our pilot plants, manufacturing operations and utility areas where process hazards may exist.

In addition, we have implemented a structured, chemical reaction hazard review program for our research laboratories.

In the early stages of product development, we conduct chemical reaction and thermal testing of our intermediate materials and products to identify potential reactivity, fire and explosion hazards, and environmental risks.

This testing continues throughout the life cycle of each product to ensure that we are aware of the process risks of each material and can properly manage these risks.

Global process safety professionals work with operations and engineering personnel to conduct process hazard analyses to thoroughly evaluate our operations.

These structured reviews take place at every stage from the initial start up through the final process design.

This ensures our facility design, equipment, operating controls and maintenance procedures are effective in identifying, evaluating, managing and mitigating process related hazards.

We have a strong construction safety program with a focus on zero harm to people, property and the environment.

Our Global Engineering Solutions (GES) group oversees hundreds of contractors and thousands of skilled craft workers on our construction projects worldwide.

Safety is integrated into all stages of our construction projects, beginning with the concept and design phases, and is carried through to Detailed Design, Construction and Commissioning Qualification.

In 2022, 10.5 million hours were spent in construction on GES Capital Project work.

Our construction safety program mandates pre job planning, hazard assessments and daily safety checks.

We also conduct peer reviews by bringing together in house engineers, contractors, the EHS construction team and other partners to conduct thorough project safety evaluations and share best practices.

In 2022, we completed 64 peer safety reviews on projects, covering 100 percent of our active projects that were chosen for peer safety reviews.

The construction industry continues to see a negative trend related to the availability of contractor and craft resources.

The impacts of this trend require management of resource availability issues, varied levels of experience and safety competencies.

GES continues to use a hyper care program to ensure additional supervision and safety oversight of new contractors, high risk work scope contractors and less experienced contractors.

We have developed global safety standards to minimize the potential for serious incidents when working at heights, entering confined spaces and working on or near machinery, piping and electrical systems.

This global effort is focused on creating a rigorous and safe approach to risk reduction when performing these non routine, high hazard work activities.

GES also uses a rigorous, third party prequalification program Highwire to evaluate and score contractors and subcontractors.

This tool allows the team to evaluate contractors’ safety programs, past safety performance, safety incident rates, experience modifier rate and training verification of craft, and reviews any regulatory citations prior to allowing them to bid on any projects.

All contractors working at our sites are required to follow a prequalification and EHS evaluation process as specified in our Company's Global Contractor Management Standard.

They are assigned an internal contractor liaison to monitor EHS compliance, perform EHS inspections and evaluations and ensure they follow their safety compliance plans.

Contractors are required to report and investigate all EHS incidents and near miss events.

The purpose of the motor vehicle safety program is to promote a strong safety culture for our employees who operate vehicles during the conduct of Company business.

The program is designed to reduce the number and severity of motor vehicle accidents and injuries along with a reduction in violations.

Our global motor vehicle safety standard and adopted programs, such as predictive analytics assessments, allow us to develop employee specific defensive driving action plans, and to promote safe driving skills and behaviors for our sales and marketing employees (who operate the majority of our business use vehicles).

We prioritize the prevention of incidents through equipment and facility design, operational and maintenance procedures and employee training.

However, in the event that unplanned incidents occur, we maintain emergency preparedness and response capabilities at our facilities.

Emergency response programs help secure the safety and well being of our employees and visitors, the protection of the environment and nearby communities, as well as protecting our physical assets.

We also conduct pre emergency planning for credible emergency scenarios such as process upsets, fires, spills, releases, severe weather and security related incidents.

Site specific emergency response procedures include incident reporting and management, personnel evacuation, and medical and incident response and control.

We routinely conduct emergency response drills and train employees in job specific and site specific emergency response duties.

Many of our manufacturing plants have on site, trained emergency response teams and mobile fire and rescue apparatus that can respond to fires, medical emergencies, technical rescues and spills releases.

Most of our emergency response teams interact directly with their local community based emergency responders and, in some cases, assist off site when requested.

We proactively assess and manage the risks associated with fires and natural catastrophes (e.g., hurricanes, floods, windstorms and earthquakes) through our Loss Prevention Program.

Fire suppression, detection and specialized protection systems.

Emergency response and business continuity programs.

We engage globally recognized, external loss prevention engineering service providers to routinely inspect and review designs and modifications of facilities.

This posture assists us in maintaining a high standard of loss prevention that corresponds to the level of operational risk, monetary value and supply chain importance.

The Industrial Hygiene (IH) program helps safeguard employee health throughout all stages of research and manufacturing.

Our IH professionals identify chemical, physical and biological hazards, and assess exposures and control risks.

Based on industry leading best practices, we accomplish this through a hierarchy of controls.

These include: Prevention Substitution Engineering Administrative and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

Our practice when designing new processes and facilities is to build safety into our designs organically by eliminating risks, substituting less hazardous processes or materials and installing effective engineering and operational controls.

We also confirm the ongoing effectiveness of these controls after installation through a robust monitoring program.

We use a similar approach when addressing existing processes and facilities.

Our priority is to eliminate hazardous materials and processes.

When elimination is not possible, we use less hazardous substitutes and then evaluate potential engineering controls to mitigate the remaining risk.

Where engineering controls are insufficient, or not feasible, we establish effective work practice controls, including those that may require selected types of PPE.

Our biological safety program aims to protect our employees, customers and communities by identifying, assessing and controlling biosafety and biosecurity risks.

We also supported the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Zodiac Project to improve biosafety in veterinary diagnostic laboratories globally, and presented on sustainable effluent decontamination at the International Veterinary Biosafety Workgroup.

In 2022, our biological safety professionals facilitated 293 biorisk assessments to support research and development and manufacturing activities across all Company divisions.

By developing and leveraging an asset called Biorisk Assessment and Repository (BAR), we believe that we have set new biorisk management standards for the industry.

BAR evaluates biosafety, bioethics and biosecurity risk associated with biological materials and establishes sustainable risk control strategies that protect human health and the environment.

We have implemented a program focused on the reduction of ergonomic risk in process, equipment design and the work environment.

We identify ergonomic risk and exposure of tasks in all areas of the organization.

Our ergonomic programs encourage employee participation in workplace assessments, risk identification and implementation of sustainable engineering controls.

Where engineering controls are not feasible, administrative and behavioral controls are implemented including, but not limited to, job rotation, job hazard identification and body mechanics training.

We also require an ergonomic design standards review for all new or renovated facilities and projects to maximize worker comfort and health and minimize ergonomics hazards and risk factors.

In 2022, there was a 47 percent reduction in ergonomic lost time injuries (15 in 2021 vs 8 in 2022).

Our remote worker ergonomic assessment process and work from home furniture policy continues to prove successful in eliminating injuries and encouraging good working habits.

This policy provides hybrid and remote workers with access to resources that guide proper home office workstation setup and identify appropriate furniture, equipment and solutions needed to maintain a healthy work from home environment.

As a result of this program, there were no lost time, recordable or first aid ergonomic cases associated with work from home computer workstations in 2022.

Occupational health principles apply to all employees and directly supervised contingent workers.

We have had a longstanding commitment to fair and equitable pay for all employees doing similar work.

This commitment is consistent with our core values of integrity, fairness and treating all people with dignity and respect.

Having the right culture, systems and practices for talent recruitment and development are critical in driving our ability to compete in global markets where talent is increasingly scarce and diverse.

Diversity, equity and inclusion are among our ethical and strategic imperatives.

Pay equity is a critical principle at our Company.

We maintain a Pay Equity Council that is deeply engaged in our pay equity initiatives.

The Pay Equity Council is jointly led by our vice president of Diversity and Inclusion and senior vice president of Global Rewards HR Operations.

Among its members are leaders within our GD I, Compensation and Benefits, Talent Acquisition and Employment Legal organizations.

Pay equity is a topic that is rightly receiving a great deal of attention.

While many other organizations have only recently begun to explore how to pay their employees equitably, providing fair and equitable pay has been one of the pillars of our compensation philosophy for many years.

Establishing clear and transparent pay practices and policies to ensure that we are paying our employees equitably across all genders, races and ethnicities.

Basing compensation on job related factors such as the nature of the job, work location, and employees’ relative skills and work experience.

Training our people managers on our diversity, equity and inclusion policies to ensure that decisions regarding employees, including those related to compensation, are based on legitimate job related criteria and not personal characteristics such as gender, race or ethnicity.

Affirming our commitment to fair and equitable pay by encouraging dialogue between people managers and employees to address pay related questions and concerns.

In 2022, as part of our commitment to increase transparency and visibility into our pay equity efforts, we conducted several education sessions, equipped our leaders with pay equity resources and engaged with employees around the globe.

With the support of external experts and legal partners, we have continued to conduct annual pay equity studies in the U.S. and abroad.

The pay equity studies take into account job related factors as described above, and allow us to identify whether any adjustments to compensation would be sensible to ensure that we continue to pay our employees equitably.

Where appropriate, based on the determinations of our pay equity studies, we make base salary adjustments to maintain pay equity across gender, race and ethnicity.

In 2022, our pay equity study achieved nearly worldwide coverage, encompassing approximately 90 percent of our global employee population, or nearly 60,000 employees.

In the U.S., our study showed that we have achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for female and male employees, and that we have achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for non white (including Black, Hispanic and Asian employees) and white employees.

Globally, targeted base pay adjustments were rarely necessary.

We remain committed to ensuring that pay equity is maintained for all employees.

Our continuing focus on pay equity furthers our goal of being the employer of choice for workers of diverse backgrounds, and it supports our efforts to attract and retain the best talent and reward performance consistent with our Leadership Standards.

These are clear business imperatives for our Company, and we remain firmly committed to them.

See our Diversity Equity page on our corporate website for more information on our commitments to pay equity and gender equality.

As part of our strategy to drive business results and advance our purpose, we remain committed to leadership development to support equity for our employees across all dimensions of diversity, including those you can see and those you cannot.

We continue to develop and offer leadership programs to promote equality and publicly report on our progress to achieve gender equality.

See GRI 404 on page 130 for more information on our leadership programs to promote equality.

A major priority at our Company is to ensure our employees feel a sense of belonging.

We promote programs for people managers that support inclusion and that our leaders use to share their perspectives.

Our Pulse surveys allow us to measure our employees' perceptions on inclusion and other critical workforce issues.

The Pulse surveys are just one of the avenues we use to directly engage employees and remain accountable to their needs.

They also allow us to be responsive to employee feedback on workforce issues and to integrate their input into decision making.

We are proud of the fact that across an average of our 2022 surveys, 81 percent of our employees stated that they feel a sense of belonging at our Company.

Also, 87 percent of our employees felt their people leader actively supported diversity and inclusion in their work group.

Related to our focus on inclusion is our commitment to a decade long practice of understanding, measuring and acting to sustain high employee engagement.

We maintain a practice of listening deeply to our employees.

This is critical to our own decision making, and influences leaders across the organization.

Many of our EBRGs offer listening forums to colleagues to foster authentic and courageous conversations in an emotionally safe environment.

Going forward, we are publicly committed to maintaining or exceeding our current employee engagement index score through 2025, as measured through Pulse surveys, which are conducted multiple times a year.

The past year reflects our ability to continually attract and retain highly qualified people, strengthen our competitiveness and mitigate employee turnover.

We have held ourselves accountable to actions designed to provide equality of opportunity and have increased our diverse representation.

Last year, we also shared our goals for improving diverse representation in senior management, including women and people of Black African American and Latino Hispanic descent.

We aim to create more opportunities for underrepresented groups by evaluating our hiring processes to determine where we can remove barriers.

This includes training our people managers on strategies to mitigate unconscious bias in the candidate selection, hiring and recognition process.

In addition to our enterprise wide, unconscious bias education (first introduced to the organization in 2014), we have developed a Learning Journey framework focused on critical capabilities, behavioral expectations and targeted learning assets to continue to drive our strategic focus and investment in building a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment for all our employees.

We invest in an industry leading, rigorous and intelligence led product integrity strategy that is solely focused on protecting patients from the harm associated with counterfeit and diverted medicines.

Our Global Security Group oversees our global product integrity strategy and leads its execution.

In 2022, we continued our commitment to increasing our focus in this area and have strategically enhanced our ability to make a long term impact on patient safety through various education campaigns.

We are committed to cooperating with relevant government agencies, other pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, health professionals, consumer groups and key related organizations in fighting the problem of counterfeit pharmaceutical products, and in educating the public about the risks of counterfeit products and how to protect against them.

This effort includes a multi pronged approach to communicating the threat that counterfeit medicines pose and to mitigating this threat as effectively as possible while recognizing that it cannot be entirely eliminated.

Appropriate collaboration and information sharing in order to raise public and stakeholder awareness of the issue and risks are a crucial focus of our product integrity program.

Through active partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies, and with organizations focused on security, patient safety and public health, we provide effective advocacy on high priority anti counterfeiting policy initiatives.

These collaborative efforts support the production of reports, white papers and data circulation initiatives, as well as promote the intelligence sharing necessary to combat threats from counterfeit medicines.

The anti counterfeiting data below details the number of new suspected and substantiated counterfeit events in 2022 and for the previous four years.

It reflects the current status of each event for all years presented as of February 2023.

Throughout 2022, Global Security addressed 2,102 product integrity events in 90 countries, involving counterfeit, diversion, supply chain security, tampering and brand security (non Merck, unapproved generic product).

Approximately 20 percent of these events have been proactively investigated by Global Security to identify new or emerging product integrity threats, or to further characterize and mitigate known threats.

We enable meaningful enforcement actions as a key strategic priority, and in 2022 our product integrity activity led to 166 arrests and the seizure of more than 11,009 units of counterfeit or illicit versions of our products.

There were 65 prosecutions resulting from product integrity investigations in 2022.

Another crucial aspect of investigations is the forensic analysis of questionable products.

This forensic testing is aimed at concluding whether a questionable product is counterfeit, diverted or otherwise illicit.

Counterfeit products are characterized to gain further intelligence and understanding of the counterfeiters and the threats to public health.

We also have forensic detection devices in the field to analyze and detect counterfeits in regions around the world.

As counterfeiters improve their skills and techniques, our forensic scientists have pioneered the use of several analytical tools for the detection and characterization of counterfeit medicines and continue to explore new analytical tools that would increase their forensic testing capabilities.

Lab findings are shared with regulatory and or law enforcement agencies and may be used to support subsequent enforcement actions and legal proceedings.

There were 771 unique questioned samples received as evidence and prepared for forensic testing in relation to active events in 2022.

As part of our proactive awareness program, throughout 2022 Global Security trained approximately 1,734 law enforcement personnel in more than 44 countries regarding the patient safety risks associated with counterfeit and diverted medication.

Global Security also launched an internal training program on the Counterfeit, Diversion and Tampering (CDT) reporting process in late 2017.

To date, more than 96,000 employees and contractors have completed this training globally.

Our proactive focus on managing supply chain security risk is based on our careful implementation and management of strict policies and procedures designed to protect the legitimate distribution of our products.

We require customers to purchase our products directly from our Company or from authorized distributors listed publicly on our corporate website.

We maintain our commitment to ensure compliance with established Company policies, standards and procedures throughout the supply chain by identifying vulnerabilities and threats to the supply network.

Resources are positioned globally to monitor and manage our security programs and investigate incidents when they occur.

As a certified Importer under the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) Program, we are validated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection as an elite Tier 3 Member recognized as implementing best practices in supply chain security.

This adds an important layer to the security of our products and materials imported to the U.S.

Serialization adding a 2D barcode with a unique identification number on each package that goes to market is one of the tools we are investing in to secure our supply chain and prevent or detect counterfeiting.

A serial number on individual packages may enable anyone along the supply chain from a distributor to a pharmacist to a patient to scan the code and verify it as a serial number corresponding to a genuine product of our Company.

Serialization can add a robust layer to our product security platform.

When associated with a regulatory mandate that specifies effective implementation and reporting to a national database, this method of product tracking can become a more meaningful product security tool.

Many jurisdictions around the world are requiring serialization on pharmaceutical packages or are considering such mandates.

However, each country’s regulations are different, which makes it very challenging for our packaging sites and distribution networks to meet these diverse and intricate requirements, with additional complexity as reporting requirements are phased in.

We launched the Global Product Serialization Initiative in 2012, with the goal of meeting these varying requirements in a robust, standardized and effective way based upon GS 1 standards.

Through these efforts, we are currently in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements related to serialization.

We are also working with industry associations and regulatory authorities to better understand potential new requirements and to advocate for simple, standardized and common sense regulations that can be effective at protecting against counterfeit medicines.

In addition to our compliance with regulatory requirements related to serialization, we are also exploring opportunities to deploy voluntary serialization and secondary verification technologies to further enhance the security and traceability of our products.

These multifactor verification systems would be enabled by blockchain nodes and applications that allow for secure and immutable product tracing that could be accessed by all supply chain partners and end users.

We are currently running several proof of concept and pilot studies involving these emerging technologies, as well as participating in active industry associations, such as PharmaLedger, to further develop and apply these digital solutions.

We have a longstanding commitment to sharing the results of our clinical trials, regardless of their outcome, in a timely manner.

If a clinical trial of a marketed product is terminated early for safety reasons, we promptly disclose medically important information to regulatory authorities and the public, update the status on ClinicalTrials.gov within 30 days and submit a manuscript to a journal (or post a summary online) within 12 months after the last patient’s last visit occurs.

If the trial was terminated for efficacy reasons, the results will be disclosed within 12 months after the last patient’s last visit occurs.

Summaries of terminated trials will provide information about patient disposition, safety and adverse experiences, as well as an explanation as to why the trial was terminated early.

We comply with all applicable laws and regulations associated with the registration of clinical trials in publicly accessible registries and subsequent posting of the results from these trials.

We have put in place the processes necessary for compliance with the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and the EU Clinical Trials Regulation No 536 2014 (EU CTR), including those related to clinical trial registration and posting results.

For those who analyze, report or publish the results of clinical trials, a clinical trial registry also provides information on trials in progress and the ability to track such trials over the course of development.

Company sponsored and conducted clinical trials involving patients assigned treatment with investigational and marketed products are registered at trial initiation on ClinicalTrials.gov, EUclinicaltrials.eu and ENCePP.eu.

In accordance with our public policy position statement on clinical trial ethics, all investigational studies in human subjects are conducted in a manner consistent with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines for the protection of human subjects, including those issued by the International Council for Harmonisation: Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP).

However, individual country regulations and guidelines should remain the primary determinant of specific requirements for the conduct of medical research.

In all regions, we have a commitment, where appropriate, to the study of diverse patient populations, including underrepresented groups, women and children.

GRI 416 2 SASB 250a.1 SASB 250a.2 SASB 250a.3 SASB 260a.1 SASB 260a.2 populations, ensuring a thorough evaluation of the safety and efficacy of our medicines and vaccines.

These efforts allow us to seek regulatory approvals throughout the world and thereby offer our medicines globally to patients who need them.

We incorporate health literacy into all aspects of a product's development and life cycle, from clinical testing to labeling and packaging to patient education.

In 2020, we founded a worldwide community of practice for health literacy, with membership from eight different nations and various corporate divisions.

This community of practice was established to assist in identifying and organizing health literacy advocates with the goal of training and educating colleagues more broadly, both through formalized, concerted efforts and through incidental collaboration in the course of daily work.

In the fourth quarter of 2021, the community of practice launched an internal health literacy dictionary with more than 1,000 words, and established an internal health literacy portal for the exchange of materials and best practices.

We are dedicated to increasing people's health literacy in the U.S. and around the world.

As part of this commitment, our health literacy team has developed a novel method to enhance the patient labeling process for new compounds.

The purpose of this is to validate comprehension across all the different consumer categories, with a particular emphasis on those who have lower levels of health literacy.

To date, 10 of our medicines have FDA authorized patient labels that were produced with input from patients whose health literacy skills ranged from low to high.

Employees who create and assess patient labeling for novel compounds have been required to undergo training in health literacy methods for patient labels since 2021.

Information about our Company, products and people is one of our most valuable assets.

We are committed to the ethical use, management, and protection of information.

Our commitment applies not only to our Company’s information but also to the information entrusted to us by others.

Our tools, processes and procedures ensure that we appropriately collect, use and safeguard information throughout its life cycle to ensure integrity of information and to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure.

We have developed and continue to improve upon a comprehensive, global, state of the art information security and cyber resiliency program.

Over the past 20 years, we have developed and continually improved a comprehensive global privacy program that promotes organizational accountability for privacy, data governance, and data protection across our business and with our collaborative partners and suppliers.

We were the first in the world to obtain regulatory approval in the EU for Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), based in part on our existing Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules (CBPRs) certified program.

This achievement demonstrates that organizations can rely on common internal standards and processes to govern international data transfers across both the EU and APEC regions to simplify their ability to address the growing regulatory challenges in this area.

Our holistic approach to privacy has its origins in biomedical research ethics and the protection of participants in the research studies that we sponsor and conduct.

We have adapted human subject research ethics standards for risk benefit analysis, transparency, anonymization, coding, and prior review to other activities and processes involving data about people.

Regulators around the world are increasingly adopting regulations similar to, or modeled on, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

We are well positioned in that our global privacy program is based on the GDPR.

Our global privacy program is also intended to be flexible and adaptable to be compliant to new laws and regulations that take effect in the jurisdictions where we conduct business.

Examples include the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) the Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) in Virginia the Privacy Act (ColPA) in Colorado the Consumer Privacy Act (CPA) in Utah the Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring Act (PDPOMA) in Connecticut and major revisions to the Data Protection Acts in China, Canada, and Indonesia.

In addition, there is increased regulatory scrutiny and interest in companies that seek to collect and monetize personal information without full transparency and permission from data subjects.

We anticipate that regulators will continue to increase requirements in these areas and levy fines.

We believe that we are well positioned for these changes due to the deployment of a comprehensive, closed loop privacy program and our active engagement with regulators around the world.

The Global Privacy Office reports to our chief ethics and compliance officer who reports directly to our chief executive officer.

Oversight of our global privacy program is conducted within the Privacy and Data Protection Board (PDPB).

This is a cross functional governance board that connects to our Company's Corporate Compliance Committee.

We are increasingly reliant on third party partners and service providers to assist us in our global operations.

Just as we need to pay close attention to privacy and data protection, so do the third parties that comprise our supply chain.

Our Company employs a robust third party due diligence process to ensure that we only do business with reputable third parties who share our values and standards.

Our approach is one of accountability and transparency.

The heart of this program is a leveraged, world class Global Privacy Program that manifests itself throughout the world as a network of over 250 Privacy Stewards.

Program maturity is measured through a combination of annual privacy self assessments at the entity and organization level, and by comprehensive privacy audits conducted by internal audit.

We also provide annual mandatory cybersecurity training to communicate and reinforce the guidelines in the Information Security Standards Handbook and our commitment to a strong cybersecurity culture.

We have established a systematic approach for ensuring employees can understand and comply with Company policies.

We developed a robust cybersecurity training and awareness program that frequently and consistently delivers both compulsory and voluntary learning opportunities designed to encourage employees to make security aware decisions regarding our Company’s information security risks.

Topics include, but are not limited to, information protection, identity, email, browsing and mobile security.

Employees are also expected to maintain an up to date record of their qualifications that details relevant cybersecurity work experience, skills, certifications and internal, industry or vendor provided training they receive.

We have a well established process by which privacy incidents can be reported to the Global Privacy Office and be investigated.

The first step of this process is to verify the facts reported and to substantiate the concern.

In 2022, we received 217 substantiated privacy concerns, which marks a 49 percent reduction compared to the previous year.

This reduction was mainly due to consistent network traffic monitoring and increased privacy and cybersecurity awareness efforts.

Four out of 217 incidents were deemed to be reportable to data protection authorities and or data subjects.

Verified concerns are investigated as part of the Company's Incident Management Process which includes a determination of whether regulatory or data subject notification is required.

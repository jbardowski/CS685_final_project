 3John Deere had an outstanding year in 2023, delivering strong performance and making 
a signiﬁ  cant positive impact on those we serve.
In this inaugural Business Impact Report, we are proud to share the ﬁ  nancial and 
sustainable outcomes accomplished by John Deere this year. This comprehensive report 
highlights our dedication to creating long-term value for all stakeholders. 
Financially, 2023 was a remarkable year for us. Our net income reached a notable $10.17 
billion, surpassing the previous year’s $7 .13 billion. Our net sales and revenues experienced 
a 16% increase, totaling $61.25 billion. And our proﬁ  tability reached impressive levels, a 
signiﬁ  cant milestone for two key reasons. First, this success was achieved despite ongoing 
inﬂ  ationary pressures. Second, it is critical in enabling us to continue investing in the next 
generation of solutions for our customers. 
We also generated signiﬁ  cant cash ﬂ  ow which, in addition to investing in our business, 
we returned to shareholders through share repurchases of over $7 billion while 
simultaneously increasing the quarterly dividend by nearly 20%.
LEAPING TO A BETTER FUTURE
Our impact extended far beyond ﬁ  nancial success. We made strategic investments that 
advanced our Smart Industrial Operating Model and reinforced the achievement of our 
Leap Ambitions. These ambitious goals focus on delivering exceptional ﬁ  nancial and 
sustainable outcomes for our customers and all stakeholders, creating lasting value while 
also making a meaningful difference throughout the world.
For instance, in our Ag & Turf Division we launched a groundbreaking planting technology 
called ExactShot™ that reduces the amount of starter fertilizer needed during planting by 
more than 60%. We also made our advanced camera detection and artiﬁ  cial intelligence 
systems from our revolutionary See & Spray™ platform available as a precision upgrade 
for previous-generation sprayers, reducing herbicide use, lowering costs, and minimizing 
impact on crops and the land. And we extended our smarter spraying capabilities by 
acquiring Smart Apply, an intelligent spray control system that enhances the precision 
and performance of air-blast sprayers used in orchards, vineyards, and tree nurseries. CHAIRMAN AND CEO LETTER

 4FPO (CEO Letter)We also introduced several new products and upgrades that 
support our Construction & Forestry customers in working 
smarter, safer, and more sustainably. Our P-Tier line of excavators, 
optimized for increased productivity, efﬁ  ciency, and reduced CO2e 
emissions, has been well-received in the market. We expanded 
our Operations Center to include the Wirtgen Group’s equipment, 
unlocking enhanced operational analysis, monitoring, and project 
planning opportunities for our roadbuilding customers. Looking 
ahead, we are excited about our upcoming X-Tier Loaders with 
E-Drive technology, slated to deliver fuel savings, emission 
reductions, and productivity gains for our customers in 2024. 
To support our Leap Ambition of reducing variability 
in our performance by achieving 10% recurring revenue 
by 2030, we are implementing a Solutions as a Service 
business model. This shift involves transitioning certain 
solutions from a traditional upfront, one-time purchase 
model to a renewal-based structure. This beneﬁ  ts our 
customers by shifting cost from the up-front sale to 
technology utilization, paying for what their operation 
needs, and delivering continuous improvement of 
products over time.
Further demonstrating our commitment to sustainability, we 
are actively engaged in research and development, as well as 
collaboration efforts, to reduce our downstream greenhouse gas 
emissions. For example, we are enhancing our best-in-class engine 
technology to achieve higher levels of efﬁ  ciency and sustainable 
performance. Additionally, we are driving advancements in battery 
technology beyond our strategic investment in Kreisel Electric, 
including exploring full battery electric or hybrid applications 
across our product lines. And our belief in biofuels as a signiﬁ  cant 
opportunity to drive additional demand for the grains and oilseeds 
our customers grow, while also fostering a sustainable future for our larger products, further guides our investments and 
advocacy to enable agriculture to play a critical role in making 
transportation more sustainable.
EMPOWERING POSITIVE CHANGE
We are incredibly proud to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the 
John Deere Foundation and reﬂ  ect on its impactful contributions. 
Over the years, the Foundation has invested more than $400 
million in nonproﬁ  t organizations, with a remarkable $100 million 
given in just the last ﬁ  ve years. This support extends to our Deere 
home communities and farmers around the world, making a 
difference where it matters most. 
In 2023, the John Deere Foundation announced three of the 
largests grants in its 75-year history by directing $19 million 
toward initiatives focused on eliminating hunger by increasing 
food access, uplifting resource-constrained farmers, and 
strengthening global food systems. These efforts are aimed at 
creating sustainable solutions and making a positive impact on 
food security worldwide. 
Whether through donating to food banks for emergency 
hunger assistance or volunteering with local organizations, the 
entire Deere family is committed to working together to create 
meaningful impact. That’s why it was a true honor for us to be 
recognized for the second consecutive year as one of the 50 
most community-minded companies in the U.S. by Points of Light, 
the world’s largest nonproﬁ  t dedicated to accelerating people-
powered change.  
It goes without saying that none of these accomplishments 
would have been possible without the dedication and passion of 
our remarkable employees. They are the driving force behind our 
success, and we are grateful for their continued commitment.
To ensure we continue to attract and retain talent with the skills to 
solve our customers’ biggest challenges, this year we introduced a comprehensive People Strategy aimed at delivering an unmatched 
employee experience. This multiyear strategy is focused on 
inspiring and engaging our employees, building our global talent 
pipeline, refreshing our culture, and ensuring we have the data, 
technology, and insights to effectively manage and develop our 
global workforce. What’s more, we remain fully committed to 
fostering an inclusive workplace where everyone feels welcomed 
and valued, and where every individual can thrive and contribute 
their unique perspectives and talents.
EMBRACING CHALLENGES, HARNESSING OPPORTUNITIES
As I reﬂ  ect on our achievements in 2023, many of which are 
included in this Business Impact Report, I am proud of the 
outcomes we achieved together. 
Looking to the future, we are fully committed to creating lasting 
value for all stakeholders, delivering exceptional customer 
outcomes, and driving sustainable practices that make a 
meaningful difference. And while markets may ﬂ  uctuate due 
to global economic uncertainties, geopolitical instability, and 
weather variability, I am excited about what lies ahead for us. I 
truly believe that we have the power to make a signiﬁ  cant positive 
inﬂ  uence on our stakeholders and the world around us.
Finally, thank you for your continued support and belief in our 
company. As we move ahead, rest assured we will continue to 
push boundaries, innovate, and strive to achieve our higher 
purpose: We run so life can leap forward. 
Respectfully,
Chairman and CEO

“We are revolutionizing the ways our customers can 
maximize the capabilities of their equipment, investing 
only in the technology and services that deliver the 
greatest value, while at the same time delivering steady 
revenue streams for our dealers and Deere.”  
  
JUSTIN ROSE
President, Lifecycle Solutions, Supply Management,
and Customer SuccessDelivering and scaling our Solutions as a Service business 
model will deliver another leap forward for our customers, our 
dealers, and John Deere. The Solutions as a Service customer 
value proposition has three key elements: 1) It will allow lower 
up-front costs to engage our world-class technology, 2) It 
will allow customers to only pay for the technology they use, 
and 3) The technology will get better over time. 
This model will closely align and deepen our relationship with 
customers, allowing us to scale our technology across more 
acres, more quickly, while bringing cutting-edge technology 
not just to new machines, but to the entire installed base via 
retrofittable options.A Solutions as a Service business model will deliver more 
consistent revenue and profit stability, as well as allow us 
to reinvest in our solutions more consistently, continually 
improving the value we can create for our customers. 
 
Ultimately, scaling this model will be the key to achieving 
our goal of 10% recurring revenue by 2030 and delivers  
on the promise of significant value creation for  
John Deere shareholders.SMART INDUSTRIAL OPERATING MODEL
In 2020, the Smart Industrial Operating Model was designed and announced with the intention to propel our 
success and customer success to the highest levels. Since then, the operating model has continued to produce 
strong results, allowing us to focus on our objective of making our customers more profitable, more productive, 
and operating in a more sustainable way. We also sharpened our focus on our business portfolio through disciplined 
capital allocation and made significant strides in technological advancements. 
 
The operating model is designed around the needs of our customer and organized by production systems — the way 
our customers work. Additionally, a centralized technology stack ensures streamlined operations, while a heightened 
emphasis on delivering value throughout the product lifecycle underscores our commitment to customer satisfac-
tion. With a legacy of manufacturing excellence, the operating model emphasizes the importance of speed, 
accountability and driving continuous improvement. 
 
Our Leap Ambitions — the outcomes by which we measure success — showcase the capabilities of our Smart 
Industrial Operating Model. These metrics serve a crucial purpose in demonstrating the value we create for 
our customers. Importantly, they also highlight the significant growth potential that lies ahead for John Deere, 
identifying an incremental addressable market opportunity of at least $150 billion USD.SOLUTIONS AS

Margin Growth Coupled With Disciplined Asset ManagementExceptional Operating Performance — 
OROS, OROA, and SVA
Our business strategy emphasizes achieving superior operating 
and ﬁ  nancial performance through aggressive goals for operating 
margin, asset management, and value creation from disciplined 
capital allocation. The metrics we use to measure progress towards 
these goals include OROS (Operating Return on Sales), OROA 
(Operating Return on Assets), and SVA (Shareholder Value Added).
The amounts shown in the charts above represent millions of dollars (USD).OROS (Operating Return on Sales)
Our focus on increasing customer value through 
technological innovation, engineering and 
manufacturing excellence, and a world-class 
dealer channel will lead to structurally improved 
ﬁ  nancials for our customers and Deere. OROS 
(for our equipment operations) demonstrates 
the commitment to deliver operating margin 
growth, reﬂ  ected in our Leap Ambitions to expand 
equipment operations OROS to 20% at mid-cycle 
by 2030.
OROA (Operating Return on Assets)
In support of our continued focus on sound 
investment of capital and asset utilization, Deere 
equipment operations are targeting an operating 
return on operating assets (OROA) of 30% at mid-
cycle sales volumes and equally ambitious returns 
at other points in the cycle.
Operating Return on Operating Assets (OROA), Operating 
Return on Sales (OROS), and Shareholder Value Added (SVA)
 are non-GAAP (general accepted accounting principles) 
measures. For reconciliations of OROA and OROS to the most 
directly comparable GAAP measure (net income attributable 
to Deere & Company), and for more information on SVA and 
reconciliations of SVA, see page 10.$61,251

2023 2022 2021SVA (SHAREHOLDER VALUE ADDED)
SVA is a non-GAAP measure that management believes is an appropriate 
measure for the performance of our businesses. SVA is, in effect, the 
pretax proﬁ  t left over after subtracting the cost of enterprise capital. 
We are aiming for a sustained creation of SVA and are using this metric 
for various performance goals. Certain compensation is also determined 
on the basis of performance using this measure. For purposes of 
determining SVA, each of the equipment segments is assessed a pretax 
cost of assets, which on an annual basis is approximately 12% of the 
segment’s average identiﬁ  able operating assets during the applicable 
period with inventory at standard cost. Management believes that 
valuing inventories at standard cost more closely approximates the 
current cost of inventory and our investment in the asset. The Financial 
Services segment is assessed an annual pretax cost of approximately 
13% of the segment’s average equity. The cost of assets or equity, 
as applicable, is deducted from the operating proﬁ  t or added to the 
operating loss of each segment to determine the amount of SVA.The difference between operating proﬁ  t and pretax cost of capital, SVA is a metric used by John 
Deere to evaluate business results and measure sustainable performance. We believe we can 
realize sustainable improvement in SVA through strong margins delivered in connection with the 
evolution of the agriculture and construction industries. Through the rapid introduction of new 
technologies and a disciplined approach to the allocation of capital for research and investment 
dollars, we believe we can target the most promising and proﬁ  table opportunities unlocking 
value for our customers. The information presented is for the years ended October 29 , 2023; 
October 30, 2022; and October 31, 2021.EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS  (Millions of $) 2023 2022 2021

 13We are strategically collaborating with 
our customers and other stakeholders 
within the dairy and livestock value chain 
to unlock opportunities to produce more 
with less. 
Over the past two decades, milk 
production has grown by 53% while 
livestock production increased 45%.1 As the 
desire for more protein-rich diets spreads 
throughout the world, those upward trends 
are not slowing down.Despite great productivity gains, these 
increases come with environmental 
challenges that producers are addressing 
through partnerships, innovation, and 
overall stewardship of the land. For 
example, the European Union (EU)’s Green 
Deal has set goals for reducing nutrient 
losses by at least 50% and reducing 
fertilizer use by at least 20% by 2030.2
Our Leap Ambition goals for sustainably 
engaged acres, nitrogen use efﬁ  ciency, and CO2e reductions are aimed at helping 
our customers navigate requirements 
like those in the EU’s Green Deal while 
also meeting their overall business and 
sustainability goals. John Deere continues

 14A HOLISTIC DAIRY FARM MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Dairy is a unique industry that intertwines crop and animal 
production, to ultimately create nutrients, milk, cheese, 
yogurt, and meat. The data and management of dairy 
products is complicated, involving many steps to manage 
the welfare of the cows, along with the production of the 
crops to feed them.
That’s why we’ve formed a strategic partnership with DeLaval 
to launch the Milk Sustainability Center (MSC) in an effort to 
create opportunities for dairy farmers to manage data more 
efﬁ  ciently while unlocking more sustainable and proﬁ  table 
outcomes. MSC is built and powered by Dairy Data Warehouse 
BV (DDW), a Dutch company offering data solutions for 
sustainable dairy.MSC is a cloud-based tool for desktop and mobile devices 
that offers the combination of ﬁ  eld and barn data aimed at 
allowing producers access to comprehensive data to make the 
best holistic decisions for their operations. MSC is designed to 
excel in offering the linkage of continuous data ﬂ  ow between 
the animal and the ﬁ  eld. We expect this will provide key 
insights and opportunities for customers to maximize proﬁ  t 
and minimize the environmental milk-production footprint.
Individual herd and ﬁ  eld data can be automatically aggregated 
to minimize manual entry. MSC can provide recommendations, 
benchmarking, simulation, and economic analysis in real time. 
MSC will be launched ﬁ  rst in the U.S., Canada, and select 
European countries. MSC relies on a conﬁ  dence indicator 
to show how granular and accurate the data input is while 
providing recommendations to optimize proﬁ  t and minimize 
emissions.
Within MSC, data can be aggregated in a carbon footprint 
and nutrient management dashboard to display a producer’s 
operation. The total carbon footprint of the farm’s operations 
can be displayed based on:
Carbon footprint per animal in CO2e/head
Carbon footprint per area of land  in CO2e/ha
Carbon footprint per milk in kg CO2e/kg Energy 
Corrected Milk (ECM)
The dashboard can also show the results for the most 
important nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) 
on a dairy farm and how efﬁ  ciently they are being used based 
on various scales like total farm, total ﬁ  elds, and total barns. 
Nutrient use efﬁ  ciency is a great indicator that can help reduce 
environmental impact and maximize proﬁ  t.“Dairy farming is perhaps the most complex agricultural 
business today with no system integration between 
crop and animal performance. Dairy farmers often 
use ﬁ  ve to seven different, non-connected software 
solutions to run their business. The MSC will enable 
dairy farmers to calculate, benchmark, simulate, and 
optimize nutrient use efﬁ  ciency (NUE) and CO2e for 
sustainable and proﬁ  table decision-making.”

Manager“MSC uses the power and insight of data 
to give dairy farmers an overall view of 
their operation and then allows them to 
dig as deep as they want into each aspect 
of their business. It not only can keep them 
seamlessly connected to what’s happening, 
but layers information so they can make 
informed decisions.”

 15GRASSLAND EFFICIENCY GAINS  
Hay is a primary food source for cattle. Harvesting 
hay is a multistep process involving multiple passes 
through the ﬁ  eld to mow the grass, spread it out 
to dry, rake it, and ﬁ  nally to either bale or chop it 
before it is collected from the ﬁ  eld. These steps 
often take place in smaller ﬁ  elds with complex 
borders, and each production step requires 
dedicated equipment with varying track spacing 
and working widths. These dynamics lead some 
producers to create individual path plans for these 
steps or — in most cases — manually steer. However, 
that can be a time-consuming process, leaving the 
producer with the likelihood of soil damage and 
contamination to the crop.  
 
AutoPath™ is an existing John Deere technology that 
can help farmers be more efﬁ  cient in their guidance 
planning and management. This solution can 
improve efﬁ  ciencies in the complicated harvest of 
a key food source for livestock and dairy cows.By using AutoPath, an operator can create a 
full-ﬁ  eld guidance plan that aligns with a selected 
ﬁ  eld boundary within two minutes and save the 
plan as a template for reuse or modiﬁ  cation in the 
future. AutoPath technology can efﬁ  ciently map 
and connect the path plans of these multiple passes, 
which may lead to lower input costs, reduced 
operator fatigue, and potentially improved yield 
and crop quality.
On top of the beneﬁ  ts of AutoPath, this technology 
can offer hay producers the opportunity to adopt 
and apply Controlled Trafﬁ  c Farming (CTF) strategies 
in grassland (hay and silage) management. CTF 
practice reuses the wheel tracks for multiple passes 
in hay and silage production. CTF may improve 
yields in grassland up to 15%3 while reducing forage 
contamination from soil up to 2%.4 This means CTF 
adoption may result in higher forage consumption, 
increased milk production, and a higher return per 
cow of more than $60 (USD).4  Reduction of wheel trafﬁ  c in the ﬁ  eld by 10% compared to manual steering.
Job efﬁ  ciencies can increase by 14% from reduction in machine overlap. 
Total processing time may decrease by 12%.
Offboard generation of the path plan can reduce inﬁ  eld setup by up to 90%.
Fuel consumption can decrease by up to 10%, potentially reducing CO2e 
emissions by nearly 15%. POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF AUTOPATH ON GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT 5:

 16SILAGE SYSTEM EFFICIENCIES
Precision agriculture technologies also play a key role in corn silage 
production. Corn silage is created by harvesting a corn crop and preserving 
it. Corn silage serves as a year-round high-energy feed source for cattle in 
dairy and livestock operations. 
Using Deere technologies such as AutoTrac™, AutoPath, iAIG, John Deere 
Operations Center™, AutoSetup™, HarvestLab™ 3000, and StarFire™ RTK 
receiver in these steps can unlock key ﬁ  nancial and sustainable outcomes 
within the production of corn silage.
For example, HarvestLab 3000 can provide efﬁ  ciencies in the slurry 
injection phase and during harvest:
Manure application: Farmers apply manure to the ﬁ  eld, providing a 
natural, organic source of nutrients to enable crop growth. HarvestLab 
3000 near-infrared (NIR) sensors allow for more uniform distribution 
of these nutrients when applying them to a ﬁ  eld. A pass to complete 
slurry injection can be combined with a strip-tillage pass, combining two 
passes into one on the ﬁ  eld. Strip till is a conservation tillage method 
that leaves more than 60% of the ﬁ  eld untilled.6 
Harvest: HarvestLab 3000 can detect key characteristics of the 
crop such as moisture and crude protein to better understand the 
performance of the silage being harvested. This can not only unlock 
the best quality within the crop but allows for maps to be created 
to calculate nitrogen removal and use efﬁ  ciency for future manure-
application optimization. If conservation methods and precision technologies such as HarvestLab 
3000 are utilized; we estimate that a producer may unlock the following 
sustainable outcomes:/uni2077 
34% improvement in nitrogen use efﬁ  ciency/uni2078
77% reduction of nitrogen losses/uni2079
28% reduction in CO2e emission per ton of silage10

/uni00B9/uni2070 Assumption that 100% CO2 emissions in the traditional system, 28% can be reduced through the Deere corn 
silage system due to less inorganic fertilizer needing to be used. This assumption considers that in corn 
production fertilizer can represent an estimated 75% of greenhouse gas emissions. This estimation is based 
on three-year average results for a model farm covering 6,500 acres producing corn and soybeans in the 
United States. Results will vary.

 17The key to agricultural sustainability lies in 
improving soil health, as soil is the farmer’s 
most valuable asset. 
Sustainable practices, like maintaining cover 
crops, reducing or eliminating tillage, and 
reducing synthetic fertilizer, can lead to healthier 
soil and more resilient yields over time. They  can 
also unlock reductions in carbon emissions and soil 
erosion while providing improvements to water 
quality, nitrogen, and crop-protection efﬁ  ciency. 
These practices can take three to ﬁ  ve years to 
show beneﬁ  ts and often demand more labor. 
To make changes to incorporate sustainable 
practices it’s critical for precision ag 
technology to do more with less, and for the 
market to support farmers ﬁ  nancially.  
To help customers access programs that may 
unlock value for sustainability, we launched the 
Sustainability Section in the Operations Center. 
This is a feature that allows U.S. ag customers to 
easily understand, compare, and sign up for third-
party programs. 
For the 2023 growing season, the Operations Center 
featured two programs: Cargill® RegenConnect and 
U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol (Trust Protocol). Cargill’s program focuses on U.S. growers of corn, cotton, 
wheat, soy, sunﬂ  owers, ﬂ  ax, and/or sorghum. The 
one-year program allows customers to get paid for 
acres with new or expanded sustainable practices 
such as cover crops and reduced tillage. The 
Trust Protocol will allow cotton growers to access 
markets for sustainably grown cotton and leverage 
ﬁ  eld practice data they collected in Operations 
Center to minimize duplicative data entry. 
Customers can also select the “notify me of new 
programs” option to receive alerts. Future plans 
for sustainability tools available through the 
Operations Center include: 
- Adding more programs for growers to 
choose from
- Enabling ﬁ  eld-level carbon emissions 
measurement and soil-health 
quantiﬁ  cation servicesWe continue to seek out new scalable opportunities that provide 
economic beneﬁ  ts to our customers who have adopted, or plan to 
adopt, more sustainable practices. This year, we announced our 
participation in Leading Harvest, piloted a Low Carbon Feedstock 
project, and trialed a carbon market program.  
What separates Leading Harvest, a nonproﬁ  t organization, is that 
it provides sustainability certiﬁ  cation at scale. The mission of 
Leading Harvest aligns with our Leap Ambitions, with the scale 
and scope of the project serving as a potential catalyst to unlock 
additional value for our customers.
More than 1.5 million acres across 30 U.S.states are enrolled 
in the program with a similar amount documented in Australia. 
John Deere, along with Nestlé, Cargill, and Nutrien Ag Solutions™, 
is a member of the founding supporter council. We see our 
engagement and support as a means to help shape industry 
certiﬁ  cation and traceability across the food and agriculture 
value chain to ultimately unlock opportunities for growers.
The Low Carbon Feedstock Pilot investigate the potential for direct 
payment to farmers for lower carbon intensity corn used for ethanol. 
The pilot covers nearly 3,800 acres that utilized a conservation 
practice. These conservation practices include the integration of 
cover crops or reduced tillage practices like strip tillage or no till. 
Due to these practices, pilot participants have so far achieved  a 14% 
reduction in carbon intensity compared to the national average.1 
Based on research and data-driven insights like this, we are 
advocating on behalf of farmers with the USDA, clean fuel markets, 
and elsewhere about the feasibility and beneﬁ  ts of paying farmers 
for producing grain with low carbon emissions.
This year we also completed a pilot carbon market program for 
utilizing more sustainable agriculture practices. Through this 
program, Nestlé purchased the carbon that was generated by 
eight Deere customers in ﬁ  ve states through the use of their 
conservation practices on their land. The Operations Center played 
an important role in this pilot by providing the farm records to 
support the soil carbon sequestration outcome.OPERATIONS

 18“Roadbuilding customers can gain key 
insights on jobsites to increase efﬁ  ciency 
and productivity by using the data 
unlocked from Operations Center.”

CENTER BENEFITS 
Expanding the Operations Center to The Wirtgen Group’s 
equipment unlocks valuable insights for our roadbuilding 
customers.
The Operations Center allows customers to manage 
site operations when it matters most, at any time, and 
from anywhere. Connected ﬂ  eets can minimize jobsite 
disruption through access to maintenance plans, digital 
alerts, and maintenance records for each machine. The 
Operations Center creates jobsites and assigns machines 
automatically based on their GPS positions. Site managers and dispatchers can clearly monitor progress on several 
jobsites in parallel and are always informed on the status of 
all projects. 
Our previous users of WITOS Fleetview  and Wirtgen 
Group Performance Tracker (WPT) Milling can now 
monitor ﬂ  eets and performance data all in the Operations 
Center. Certain parameters for the individual jobsite are 
summarized, including total machine utilization, total 
fuel consumption rates, average fuel emissions rates, and 
several additional performance parameters for cold milling 
machines equipped with WPT Milling. MACHINE ANAL YZER UPDATES FOR ALL
In 2023, Machine Analyzer was updated to capture not 
just the fuel rate but also the carbon emissions from fuel 
consumption. Machine Analyzer is a feature available 
in Operations Center for agriculture, construction, and 
forestry machinery where users can compare performance, 
fuel usage, and utilization for machines across their ﬂ  eet. 
This updated feature allows customers to easily measure 
and compare their machines’ emissions over time, with 
the ability to share that data with stakeholders that are 
requesting emissions information.

 19See & Spray Technology 
Performance
IN 2023, SEE & SPRAY 
TECHNOLOGY WAS USED ON OVER 
1M ACRES
(LARGER THAN THE STATE OF 
RHODE ISLAND), WHICH 
HELPED FARMERS ACHIEVE 
NEARLY 2/3 REDUCTION IN 
SOLUTION, SAVING OVER
8M GALLONS5Protecting crops after emergence is one of the most critical 
steps growers take on their way to optimizing productivity of 
every acre. Whether eliminating pests or nutrient-stealing weeds, 
the inputs of herbicides and pesticides can be an expensive 
necessity nearly every agriculture production system faces.
That’s why our continued expansion of smarter spraying 
capabilities are designed to not only increase our growers’ 
overall efﬁ  ciency and proﬁ  tability, but also link back to key 
Leap Ambition goals around engaged acres, sustainably 
engaged acres, connected machines, crop-protection 
efﬁ  ciency, and customer CO2e emission reductions.
Headlining our expansion this year were both established and 
emerging technologies in Deere’s “sense and act” portfolio.
The foundational innovation in this space is See & Spray™ 
Ultimate, our computer-vision and machine-learning product 
that utilizes 36 cameras across a carbon ﬁ  ber sprayer boom 
to determine what is a weed and what isn’t.1 See & Spray 
Ultimate makes that determination within 200 milliseconds2 
through the use of vision-processing units that scan more 
than 2,100 square feet per second.1
By only spraying the weeds and not solely relying on broadcast 
methods, growers can reduce non-residual herbicide inputs by 
up to two-thirds with See and Spray Ultimate.3
As we work to get these pivotal technologies in the hands of 
customers faster, part of our ﬁ  nal product development phase 
has involved our customers putting See & Spray to use out in 
the ﬁ  eld. Our See & Spray Customer Success Team provided 
our customers and dealers with data and insights around their 
acreage and herbicide use savings with recommendations to 
further improve utilization and drive even more savings.And we’re working to ensure that not just new machines have 
access to this technology. Machines sold without the factory-
installed version of See & Spray can still access the technology 
through See & Spray™ Premium, our new Precision Upgrade kit. 
Once a See & Spray Premium Precision Upgrade kit is installed 
on a sprayer, farmers can cover more acres than before on a 
single tank — while using targeted spray — making fewer stops 
to ﬁ  ll and using less chemical and water.
See & Spray Premium’s BoomTrac™ Pro 2.0 technology provides 
camera stability to capture images of the ﬁ  eld. Those images are 
used by machine-learning models to differentiate weed from 
crop, and once a weed is detected, ExactApply™ nozzles spray 
it. Currently, See & Spray Premium is offered for model year 
2018 and newer John Deere sprayers in the U.S., and it requires 
the machine to have a factory-installed ExactApply system or 
ExactApply Precision Upgrade kit with 15- or 20-inch spacing and 
a 120-foot steel boom.4 See & Spray Premium allows us to expand 
model and model-year compatibility while also introducing the 
technology to growers around the world.
See & Spray Premium aligns with our broader strategy of 
helping our customers beneﬁ  t from today’s newest technology 
on older machines and model types. Similar to what we’ve 
done with ExactEmerge™ Precision Upgrade, we’re looking to 
deliver better performance on our equipment, allowing more 
customers to unlock the economic and sustainable value of this 
technology. SMARTER SPRAYING TECH EXPANSION

 20MORE VALUE FOR HIGH-VALUE CROPS
Our smart-spraying capabilities now extend to 
high-value crops (HVCs) as a result of the company’s 
acquisition of Smart Apply Inc., a precision spraying 
equipment company that developed the Smart Apply® 
Intelligent Spray Control System™. 
HVCs generate signiﬁ  cantly higher value per acre 
than grains or oilseeds. The three primary HVC 
categories include bedded crops (vegetables and 
melons), vineyards (grapes and other berries), and 
orchard crops (almonds, citrus, olives, apples, etc.).
Smart Apply’s intelligent spray system is an upgrade 
kit that improves the precision and performance of 
any air-blast sprayer used in orchard, vineyard, and 
tree nursery spraying applications. 
The spray system can also improve productivity 
since less time is being used to reﬁ  ll tanks. Smart 
Apply’s precision spraying can help achieve up to 
93% less chemical runoff and up to an 87% reduction 
in airborne drift.6 Smart Apply can also help reduce 
the total amount used in blast spraying operations 
by up to 50%, including water and crop protection 
chemicals.6 Smart Apply can deliver all of these 
beneﬁ  ts while maintaining yields.“Smart Apply is a continuation of our commitment 
to high-value crop customers and dealers, further 
expanding a portfolio of solutions to help growers 
address their biggest challenges around labor, input 
costs, and regulatory requirements, and achieve 
environmental goals,” Bailey said.
The system documents date and time of spraying, 
overall spray volumes, chemical savings, tree counts,

 23Our customers’ success ultimately relies on their — and 
our — understanding of an often complex interconnected 
environment or ecosystem. In our effort to deliver 
products that align with our 2030 Leap Ambition goal 
of reducing Scope 3 upstream and downstream CO2e 
emissions (Scope 3, Category 1 and 11) by 30%, we remain 
focused on solutions that will continue to meet the 
power needs required in those unique ecosystems. We 
know that a singular technology will not be the solution 
across our entire portfolio of products, so ensuring that 
each product line has the optimal solution is our goal.
Our internal research and development efforts around 
alternative propulsion are focused both on advancing 
our best-in-class engine technology to deliver more 
sustainable performance, while also now investing in 
battery technology through our investment in Kreisel 
Electric. Both of these will be critical on our journey to 
delivering on our Leap Ambitions.
For engines, our John Deere Power Systems (JDPS) teams 
continue to target the most fundamental part of engine 
development — efﬁ  ciency — to drive a key part of CO/two.inf e 
reduction in our products in the near term. Innovations 
in combustion, friction, and heat transfer within engine 
operation can improve our best-in-class fuel efﬁ  ciency and 
deliver emissions reductions.
When it comes to batteries, we are leveraging our 
expertise in propulsion innovation and production from 
decades of leadership in the engine business to build 
an efﬁ  cient global battery business. 
We are also pursuing stationary and mobile-charging 
solutions for our dealers and customers. We are currently 
working to bring the level 3 battery-integrated charger

The Small Ag & Turf Division has committed to delivering a 
fully-electric option in each Turf and Compact Utility tractor 
product family. New turf care machines launched this year are 
tailored to our golf course customers, including electric Gator™ 
utility vehicles, E-Cut Electric walk-behind greens mowers, 
and hybrid fairway mowers. Hybrid and battery-electric 
technology delivers numerous beneﬁ  ts for this segment of 
our customer base. Compared to non-hybrid mowers, 7700A 
E-Cut Fairway Mower has 90% reduction of hydraulic leak 
points, reduced fuel consumption and less engine noise.1 
Additionally, the E-Cut Electric walk-behind greens mowers 
can cover 50,000 square feet on a single charge, all while 
using no fuel or oil and running virtually silent.2
What makes these products attractive to our customers is 
their precision and ease of use, efﬁ  ciency gains associated 
with hybridization, fuel savings, noise reduction, and 
charging ease.
This equipment also delivers access to OnLink golf 
management software, a solution that integrates with the 
John Deere Operations Center™, helping customers improve 
communication between managers and employees, enhance 
their facility’s organization, and harness data to enable 
better decision-making. OnLink also provides integrated 
labor and ﬂ  eet management tools enhanced with machine 
connectivity.
Away from the golf course, our residential customers are 
beneﬁ  ting from electriﬁ  cation as well. This year customers 
received ﬁ  rst deliveries of Deere’s fully-electric lithium-ion-
powered Z370R Electric Zero Turn Mower, which delivers a 
quieter experience, with no exhaust and all the performance. 
Further, we’ve expanded our battery-electric residential 
lineup through our new partnership with EGO™. As part of 
this new agreement, EGO-branded battery products will be 
available through our dealer network, bringing additional 
ﬂ  exibility and compatibility to our customers. EGO batteries 
are portable and can be used across 70 compatible products, 
allowing customers to complete a multitude of projects all 
on the same battery system.3“Our future-generation excavator models 
not only leverage what we’ve learned from 
our customers, but also utilize John Deere’s 
decades of global excavator experience to 
bring the most innovative and game-changing 
machines to market.” 
AARON KLAUER
Global Product Manager, 
Mid-and-Large Size 
Excavators, John DeereMOVING THE EARTH, EFFICIENTL Y
In our Construction & Forestry Division, we revealed 
multiple new excavators through updates to current 
generation and future generation models. These 
updates showcase our ability to leverage enterprise 
technologies to deliver solutions to our customers 
that will help them work smarter, safer, and more 
sustainably. 
One example is our new 75 P-Tier and 85 P-Tier 
Excavators that were launched in 2023. Compared 
to the previous G-Series models, the P-Tier models 
have a redesigned larger cab, new machine options, 
and performance enhancements that improve fuel 
efﬁ  ciency by 10%.5 This allows customers to do more 
work while using less fuel.
Additional machines released in 2023 include the 210 
P-Tier, 250 P-Tier, and 300 P-Tier. These updated current 
generation models use electronic on-demand cooling 
fans that reduce fuel consumption by 7% compared to 
their G-Series predecessors.6  In addition, these models 
include durability enhancements to maximize customer 
uptime  and provide improved user experience with our 
OEM exclusive bucket camera system.

 25EXCAVATORS TO LOADERS AND ROLLERS
But we didn’t just stop at excavators. Our 
744 X-Tier and 824 X-Tier loaders with E-Drive 
Technology are expected to deliver fuel savings, 
emission reductions and productivity gains for our 
customers when they hit the market in 2024. 
An electric-variable transmission (EVT), similar to 
what is already available on MY23 8 Series Tractors 
with 410 horsepower, is being introduced for the 
ﬁ  rst time on these loader models. Two electric 
motors and an inverter housed on the EVT allow 
the system to manage torque and power more 
efﬁ  ciently to the ground. 
By delivering near-instant response to the operator, 
we are bringing a simpliﬁ  ed operation with a 
single pedal, which helps eliminate complexity 
and fatigue while providing the next evolution 
in controllability. The 744 X-Tier and 824 X-Tier 
loaders with E-Drive technology can deliver more 
power and better torque performance, with less 
cost, fuel, emissions, and stress on operators. Wirtgen’s Hamm electric battery-driven tandem 
rollers, introduced in 2022, are a prime example of 
customers seeing beneﬁ  ts in our new models. 
“The machine works extremely quietly yet 
still has a high compaction force – I didn’t 
notice any difference. It is also good that the 
machine is operated in exactly the same way 
as the diesel machine, meaning that I could 
get started as usual, right from the outset. I 
also liked the driving and steering behavior.” 
said Vincent van Tiul, roller driver, company 
Gebr. Van Kessel, Netherlands, HD 10e VV
Based on customer and operator needs, we aim 
to deliver 20+ electric and hybrid-electric product 
models by 2026. The 744 X-Tier and 824 X-Tier 
loaders with E-Drive technology and the HD 10e 
VV Tandem Rollers are examples of product models 
that will deliver on this Leap Ambition, but most 
importantly, will unlock opportunities for customers 
to do more with less. CONTINUED FOCUS ON RENEWABLE FUELS
Beyond the design of the propulsion technology 
itself, another critical element is the power source 
or fuel it utilizes. To deliver sustainable solutions 
to our customers, we must not only consider the 
environmental potential of a solution, but the 
conditions and demands of the production system 
in which our customers operate.  
For this reason, we continue to invest in and 
advocate for the development and expansion of 
renewable fuel options for industries like ours, and 
we believe biofuels (including ethanol, renewable 
diesel, and biodiesel) are promising solutions for 
our larger products. With current technology, a full 
battery-electric version of these products would 
not deliver the outcomes desired by our customers. 
Take the 9R Tractor at 620 horsepower, for example. 
The 9R’s fuel capacity is 400 gallons at an additional 
weight of nearly 2,800 pounds. Changing that to 
full electriﬁ  cation would mean almost 60 batteries 
at a weight of nearly 67 ,000 pounds — more than 
20,000 pounds heavier than the tractor itself.8 
The 9R currently sells for about $430,000.8 The 
price of almost 60 batteries to power the tractor 
would exceed nearly $1.3 million today.8 Beyond the 
additional cost and weight to the equipment, access 
to charging infrastructure and length of machine 
operation continue to be signiﬁ  cant challenges 
with electriﬁ  cation, given current technology. 
For these reasons, through partnerships with 
universities, companies in adjacent industries, and 
governmental agencies, we are investigating and 
developing renewable fuel solutions that will work 
for our customers and their operating conditions 
and demands.744 X-TIER LOADER WITH E-DRIVE TECHNOLOGY:

 26LESS GREENHOUSE GASES 
THAN GASOLINE8ETHANOL PROVIDES 
UPWARDS OF
40%To this end, we are working toward developing an ethanol 
burning 9-liter engine. Ethanol provides upwards of 40% 
less CO2e emissions than gasoline, and the production and 
distribution network for ethanol is already mature in many 
geographies around the world.8 We displayed a concept 
9-liter engine that is compatible with ethanol at the 2023 
AGRITECHNICA show. The concept engine illustrates the 
company’s ongoing commitment to developing a diversiﬁ  ed 
portfolio of solutions that can meet power needs across 
equipment sizes and applications, while delivering lower 
greenhouse gas emissions. We are most excited about what a 
biofuels answer for low carbon transportation fuels means for 
the business of our customers, particularly in the United States 
and Brazil, that grow the primary feedstocks contributing to 
ethanol production.  
While we continue development work in ethanol technology, our 
available engines can run on renewable diesel, a 50–80% less 
carbon intensive alternative to petroleum-based fuels.10
Due to the limited capacity and infrastructure for renewable diesel 
production, we continue to participate in pilot programs tied to 
the growing of winter oilseed cover crops that can serve as an 
incremental source of feedstocks for renewable diesel production. 
This includes partnerships that employ camelina (also being 
explored for jet fuel) across Minnesota, Iowa, and Texas.The potential for winter oilseed cover crops to serve as 
a new source of feedstock for biofuels production has 
numerous beneﬁ  ts. Winter oilseed cover crop integration 
helps promote soil health through the establishment 
of strong root structures in the ground. This also has 
the potential to convert a cost into a second source of 
revenue for the farmer, all while expanding the available 
feedstocks for biofuel production.
While growing and harvesting camelina, we gained insight 
on optimal settings and conﬁ  gurations for our equipment 
to allow for better planting, spraying, and harvesting of 
the crop. We also learned about the impact various crop 
rotations can have on camelina’s yield as well as the main 
crop yield and how the oilseed itself can shatter easily 
once mature, making harvest timing critical.
We will continue to explore the opportunities for oil 
seeds to increase the production of renewable diesel 
and provide new revenue streams for customers.  1 Deere, 7700A E-CutTM Hybrid Fairway Mower, https://www.deere.

 27Our focus on product circularity revolves around 
implementing economic and sustainable solutions to 
extend a machine’s life. It’s this balance that drives our 
Leap Ambition goals of achieving 95% recyclable product 
content, ensuring 65% product content is sustainable 
material, and growing our John Deere Reman 
business by 50%.
Our remanufacturing business focuses on core parts 
and components that are designed to add value to 
the life of the product while reducing environmental 
impacts. These core components include complete 
engines, engine components and accessories (starters, 
alternators, and AC compressors), electronics (display 
monitors, control units, and moisture sensors), 
drivetrains, and hydraulic components.
Ready-to-go remanufactured components — backed by 
John Deere quality — give our customers the ﬂ  exibility of 
replacing a failed part on an older machine with minimal 
downtime and the ability to get the most out of the 
equipment by maximizing its usefulness. One example of 
how our dealer channel is utilizing these remanufactured 
parts is through our certiﬁ  ed Powertrain ReLife Plus 
program.  
 
The ReLife program begins with a machine that is 
approaching an hour level where the major powertrain 
components are beginning to wear out. Based 
on detailed inspection by our certiﬁ  ed dealer and 
collaboration with the customer on desired changes, 
the ReLife often includes replacement of powertrain 
components and repair or replacement of many other 
auxiliary components, including some new components. 
The program is supported by Deere and executed by our dealers, providing a unique cost-savings service 
to our customers, with an extended warranty option 
available. ReLife provides a ﬂ  exible solution that can 
match customers’ ﬂ  eet management needs and desire 
for optimized cost of ownership 
This ReLife program strengthens our environmental 
commitments while allowing customers to extend 
the usage of their machines with a lower total cost 
of ownership. For example, 93% of a 19-ton H-Series 
Skidder can be reused in the ReLife program.1  
ReLife enables additional connection points from 
dealer to customer by providing another option to help 
customers manage their owning and operating costs.EXTENDING THE PRODUCT

The use of John Deere Reman components in this 
process also drives emissions reductions. Not having to 
make a new engine or axle from scratch, for example, 
means natural resources are preserved, melting furnaces 
aren’t ﬁ  red up, and carbon footprints can be smaller. 
As our product road map shifts and we continue to 
advance our innovations, we understand that product 
circularity doesn’t end with hard iron. Our ambitions 
around electrifying more machines means we also 
are applying many of these similar approaches to the 
batteries that power them. That’s why we continue to 
explore repairing and refurbishing batteries as well as 
what will be needed to recycle them or provide them a

 31We have validated Science Based Targets to reduce our Scope 1 
and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by an additional 50% by 
2030, with ﬁ  scal year 2021 serving as the baseline. In 2023, we 
are making progress, with a 15% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions from our 2021 baseline. To continue to deliver Scope 1 
and 2 GHG emission reductions, we'll aim to implement additional 
efﬁ  ciency gains in operations and facilities processes, and use 
even more renewable electricity and fuels. 
We’re also engaging our global teams in this endeavor to identify 
opportunities for efﬁ  ciency. Our engineering and technology teams 
have identiﬁ  ed energy efﬁ  ciencies throughout 10 manufacturing 
sites in India, Brazil, and the U.S. The teams identiﬁ  ed nearly 400  OPPORTUNITIES  
to realize a reduction in nearly 13,000 METRIC TONS  of 
CO2e, equating to almost $2.4 MILLION (USD)  in savings.1
From these identiﬁ  ed opportunities, our global 
facilities completed several projects on lighting, 
compressor efﬁ  ciencies, and updates to condensers, 
chillers, and cooling towers, equating to nearly 
248 METRIC TONS  of CO2e savings and 
$147 ,000 (USD)  cost avoidance per year.1 As we continue to invest in renewable energy, several sites are 
using solar photovoltaics as an important strategy lever for 
reducing emissions and managing cost. For example, a Wirtgen 
Group production site in Pune, India, completed a new solar 
photovoltaic project in 2023, with a 25-year lifetime, that is 
expected to help us avoid about 1,000 mt-CO2e emissions per year.2

 32Engaging our supply base is crucial to our success in reducing 
upstream greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. From strategically 
analyzing product materials and supplier data, we have identiﬁ  ed the 
opportunities in partnering with our supply chain that can have the 
most signiﬁ  cant impact on GHG emissions.
Many of these priority areas have a signiﬁ  cant overlap with the 
materials that will be critical to achieving the company’s Leap 
Ambitions around product circularity. For ﬁ  scal years 2022 and 2023, 
we focused on collaborating with suppliers in energy-intensive 
industries such as steel, castings, tires, hydraulics, electronics, 
batteries, engines and power systems. Currently, we are estimating Scope 3, Category 1 
GHG Emissions based on spend and industry 
average emissions data. However, the ideal future 
state is for supplier-speciﬁ  c emissions data to 
inform these calculations. We are encouraged 
that approximately 65% of our key suppliers by 
spend are measuring and publicly reporting certain 
categories of their emissions. Engagement with 
our supply base to continue working on measuring 
and reporting their emissions and setting goals to 
reduce those emissions is a key initial part of our 
strategy to improve Scope 3 measurements and our 
sourcing decisions. We continue to take steps to 
work with suppliers so that they can grow with 
us to achieve our Leap Ambitions.
De Jong Manufacturing Inc. is an example of 
a supplier relationship that is supporting our 
sustainability journey. De Jong Manufacturing Inc. 
is a woman-owned small business that supplies 
metal fabrications to us. In order to continue to 
be eligible for our Supplier Achieving Excellence 
program, they began calculating and estimating 
additional CO2e emissions like Scope 2 and some 
Scope 3 categories in 2023. The company also 
completed our sustainability assessments.OF KEY SUPPLIERS ARE

Pounds of WoodWith the launch of the Leap Ambitions, we transitioned our focus 
from recycling waste to intentionally working to generate less waste 
relative to our operations. Global teams are focusing on process 
management and partnering with logistics and supply management 
to achieve our 2030 Leap Ambition of reducing waste intensity by 15%.
For 2023, we started to identify more opportunities throughout 
our facilities to reuse wood instead of shredding or discarding 
it. Several manufacturing and warehouse sites were able to start 
implementing projects to design out waste and improve reuse 
and recycling:
Working with a wood-recovery supplier, 
John Deere Augusta Works in Georgia was 
able to reuse nearly  600,000 pounds 
of wood.        
Our North American Parts Distribution 
Center (NA-PDC) in Milan, Illinois, also 
deployed a similar Wood Waste Reduction 
Project with astounding results. Nearly 1.4 
million pounds of wood was diverted 
for reuse as opposed to shredding or 
sending it to the landﬁ  ll.
John Deere Beit Hashia Works Ltd. (JDBH), 
in Israel reduced nearly 40,000 pounds 
of wood waste by updating suppliers 
and implementing returnable 
packing metal racks.“The wood reuse and reduction 
projects at Augusta, NA-PDC, 
and JDBH are early examples 
of successful collaboration to 
implement sustainable solutions 
within our operations.”

 34WATER INTENSITY
NEARL Y 
30,000 CUBIC METERS
reduction in water consumption at 
Dewas and Pune Works compared to 2021Water is a key input not only for our customers but also for our 
global manufacturing operations.
By using the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Water 
Risk Atlas tool, certain John Deere manufacturing sites 
were determined to be in water-stressed areas, mainly 
in Mexico, India, and China. By 2030, we aim to reduce 
freshwater consumption intensity by 10% at these water-
stressed manufacturing locations. We plan to achieve this 
goal by optimizing water reuse, developing more process 
efﬁ  ciencies, improving infrastructure maintenance, and 
increasing gray-water use.In India alone, multiple projects have been implemented to 
reduce water consumption at Dewas Works and Pune Works:
JOHN DEERE DEWAS WORKS
Water consumption was reduced by eliminating the use of 
water in the paint booth by transitioning to a dry booth. 
The project involved replacing the water scrubber with a 
ﬁ  ltering mechanism that is dry in nature and collects paint 
dust and contaminants from the booth.
Other Dewas projects worked on in 2022 and 2023 include:
Deployed electronic submetering to track the 
exact consumption of different water uses.
Installed sensors in bathroom and kitchen faucets 
to control water ﬂ  ow.
Switched to treated/gray-water use for toilet 
ﬂ  ushing in the administration building washrooms.
JOHN DEERE PUNE WORKS
The facility added a second treatment plant to gain efﬁ  ciency 
in water recycling and reuse for industrial wastewater and 
sewage treatment. This also allowed more gray water to be 
reused in the bathrooms on additional ﬂ  oors at the facility.
Non-Water-Stressed Sites Find Savings Too
Work also is underway at other facilities to decrease water 
use, even if those operations are not water-stressed sites. 
For example, at John Deere Harvester Works in East Moline, 
Illinois, we implemented improvements to reduce overﬂ  ow 
from 6.5 to 4 gallons per minute in the front-end equipment 
paint booth. These updates can save nearly 2,700 gallons per 
day in rinse-water waste.

 38At every Deere location around the world, we focus our efforts and 
strategies on both ﬁ  nding the best talent and building a pipeline of 
candidates prepared to support our future.  
This approach is ﬁ  rmly linked to our mission for employees to choose 
their own path and build their own capabilities by gaining the necessary 
experience, skill-building opportunities, career planning, and leadership 
development necessary to map out a successful future at Deere. 
Whether an employee’s goal is to grow in their ﬁ  eld, within their 
current role, or as a team, we believe we offer the tools and solutions 
needed to fuel the individual’s learning journey while unlocking career 
opportunities. And most importantly, these opportunities touch nearly 
every corner of our enterprise. BUILDING OUR GLOBAL 
TALENT PIPELINEDEI GLOBAL ADVISORY BOARD   
We know how important it is for prospective and current 
employees to experience a welcoming work environment. 
Our commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion is built on 
our strong foundation of integrity and treating each other 
with fairness and respect. This commitment is stated in our 
Code of Business Conduct. As we prepare our people to 
meet tomorrow’s food, housing, infrastructure, and energy 
challenges, we will need everyone’s perspectives and ideas 
to drive progress and fuel creative problem-solving. By 
valuing both our differences and our shared humanity, we 
can succeed in delivering an unmatched employee experience.
 
Grounded in the connection between our Smart Industrial 
strategy and DEI, we founded a new DEI Global Advisory 
Board to provide strategic oversight and leadership-driven 
progress on inclusion. Other teams include:
• Regional councils to drive accountability.
• Partnership with local business units to support 
  our culture.
• A global DEI team to set our winning strategy. 
• Leadership councils to drive impact.
• ERGs and professional organizations to support our
strategy activations.ERGS GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT
Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are an 
essential component of our people-focused 
strategy. This year, to provide a meaningful 
way to connect and expand the impact of 
our ERGs, we held a two-day ERG Leadership 
Summit at our global headquarters in Moline, 
Illinois. 
 
The summit included representation from all 
13 ERGs from across the globe. The summit 
provided a collaborative environment to learn 
more about the growing importance of ERG 
roles and strategize on further opportunities 
to support our People Strategy.  
 
By working together, we believe we can 
attract, develop, engage, and retain top 
talent globally while continuing to champion 
policies, practices, and behaviors that 
amplify our innovations on behalf of people, 
communities, and the planet.
“By maximizing the full value of our ERGs, 
we will enable their unique ability to provide valuable 
insights to our people, business, and product strategies 
in the diverse global markets where we operate.”

Strategic upskilling 
Strategic workforce planning is proactively aligning an 
organization’s workforce with strategic objectives. It involves 
forecasting future workforce needs, identifying high priority 
skill gaps, and developing targeted strategies to address them. 
As we grow our global talent pipeline, the initial focus is on 
three areas for upskilling — Electriﬁ  cation, Data and Analytics, 
and Embedded Software. 
In alignment with our Leap Ambition goals around developing 
a ﬂ  eet of battery-electric powered machines, we have 
launched the ﬁ  rst pilot to upskill our engineers in the critical 
ﬁ  eld of electriﬁ  cation. By expanding their abilities and 
documenting their expertise, we are investing in our existing 
talent to help build our talent pipeline. 
This pilot focuses on closing skill and position gaps in 
electriﬁ  cation. The ﬁ  rst wave includes ten engineers from various 
disciplines who will give feedback on the quality and applicability 
of the program while enhancing their skills. 
The next phase of the pilot in 2024 will include identifying 
additional engineers seeking to enter the electriﬁ  cation ﬁ  eld 
and scale the program to close our future gaps. 
Additionally, in our learning experience platform, Compass, pilots 
for Data and Analytics and Embedded Software were initiated.Apprenticeships   
We continue to reach into our home communities and identify future 
colleagues. Since 2019 , we’ve participated in the U.S. Department of 
Labor’s high school Registered Apprentice program by providing work-
based learning opportunities for students after they have completed 
their junior year of high school. By connecting with local high schools, 
we’ve had success in hiring 72% of program graduates.
Currently offered at 15 Deere locations, we’ve expanded 
the apprenticeship program to include ﬁ  ve occupations — 
information technology (IT) software engineer, computer 
numerical control (CNC) machinist, welder, assembler 
technician, and customer service representative. 
Our IT apprenticeships recently expanded to additional high schools in 
Illinois. The program will provide a minimum of 2,000 hours of hands-on 
experience and an industry-accredited certiﬁ  cation that may be accepted 
in place of a two- or four-year degree for an entry-level position. Two of 
our IT software engineer apprentices are students at Chicago High School 
for Agriculture Sciences, a magnet institution for students pursuing 
interests in agriculture.“We continue to invest in 
high-potential, diverse talent 
early in their career journey. 
By doing this we’re creating 
a clear path for exceptional 
talent to join and stay with 
John Deere.”
HEATHER ARTHOFER    
Principal EngineerNew Technology and Engineering Talent
At Deere, we continually expand our recruiting efforts to cultivate new 
technology and engineering talent. 
In 2023, we expanded our recruiting reach through partnerships 
with several organizations to increase brand awareness to attract 
prospective technology and engineering talent, including:
• Completed a brand-awareness campaign at AFROTECH™, which 
reached over 20,000 subscribers to the AfroTechInnovators database.
• Sponsored a booth and networking event at the 10th annual Lesbians 
Who Tech & Allies global virtual pride summit, allowing us to reach 
over 10,000 technology professionals.
• Created an environment for prospective engineers to have personal 
opportunities to interact with multiple Deere team members at 
the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) National 
Convention. For instance, this year we mentored students as they 
worked together to solve the annual Xtreme Engineering Challenge.

 40Since an apprenticeship is considered the ﬁ  rst employment 
contract a worker will have, Frank said John Deere works very 
hard at introducing opportunities to the community and then 
transitioning apprentices into the company. Frank added that 
for every apprentice job opening, there are two to three times 
the number of applicants, underlining the community’s desire 
for employment at Deere. 
There are several examples of our programs ﬂ  ourishing 
and helping to build a diverse and inclusive workforce at 
Horizontina. This year, our manufacturing and assembly class 
increased female participation to 75%, our highest female 
participation compared to recent years. In 2023 we also hired 
ﬁ  ve apprentices from our program that focuses on providing 
employment opportunities for people with intellectual 
disabilities. 
In the last three ﬁ  scal years, Brazil has welcomed, and trained 
approximately 600 apprentices from local communities. EUROPE
Development Days Tour
Based on employee feedback, our German team created 
and launched a development tour at six of their business 
locations. They conducted two-day onsite-development 
events in each location to enhance employee-growth 
opportunities and transformation to a future-oriented 
learning culture while also strengthening relationships 
and networking. Nearly 1,300 employees participated 
in roughly 1,500 hours of development time across 163 
sessions. 
Our employees were able to learn about new tools, receive 
individual career counseling, network with industry peers, 
and attend leadership training and classes on “change-
and-design” thinking.Apprenticeships in Brazil
While companies in Brazil are required by government 
regulation to provide apprenticeship opportunities, our 
program has ﬂ  ourished with apprenticeship training that 
highlights career development, community engagement, 
and diversifying our workforce.
For example, several former apprentices now are factory 
managers, the top position at our global manufacturing 
facilities in Horizontina and Catalão.
LATIN AMERICA
Early Leadership Acceleration Program
In Latin America, we have focused on continuing to develop 
early talent via our Early Leadership Acceleration Program. 
This program includes self-assessments, behavior case 
presentations, leaders teaching leaders, and a hackathon 
with challenge-solution methodology. The program has 
been successful due to the diversity of the participants 
networking together in pitches, future-driven leadership 
in self-directed studies, and discussions for developing 
leadership skills. 52% of the program graduates from the 
2022 class have either received promotions or taken 
new lateral positions. There have been early indicators 
of success for the 2023 program as well, with 30% of

 41Apprenticeships 
John Deere’s German apprenticeship program is 
about 100 years old and began due to an identiﬁ  ed 
shortage of skilled labor and worker qualiﬁ  cations.
 
In Mannheim, more than 40 apprentices complete 
training annually in our 24,000-square-foot 
facility. The program teaches a wide range of skills, 
including milling, CNC technology, electronics, 
mechatronics, and multiple production systems.

For the Wirtgen Group, similar training exists 
through its vocational program. Wirtgen and 
the other German brands of the company have 
employed 340 trainees. With a mission of “training 
tomorrow’s workforce,” Wirtgen offers its 
apprentices permanent employment at one of 
its 45 subsidiaries around the globe, including 
facilities in Brazil, China, and India. A highlight of 
the program involves the second year of training 
in which enrollees of the German production 
locations gather once a year at the AZUBI (German 
for “trainee”) Tech Days to take part in their own 
roadbuilding project. About 80 trainees from all 
ﬁ  ve Wirtgen brands participated in the three-day 
event in 2023.
 INDIA  
Development Road map
India’s Diversity Development Road map program is 
focused on helping women prepare for leadership 
opportunities within our company. Since it began in 2017 , 
nearly 700 women at Deere have taken part in the program.
The road map includes training for all levels of leadership, 
categorized by:
• Women leaders poised for the next big leap: providing 
connections to academic immersion with leading 
business schools and action learning projects.
• Emerging leaders at mid-career: recognizing the objective 
of overcoming barriers for continued development.
• Entry level trainees: “Taking Flight” — an innovative 
program — helps outline potential challenges for 
working women in India and how to address them.
This layered and focused approach towards development 
of female talent has helped retain and increase diverse 
representation across all levels in the country.

John Deere’s commitment to development 
extends far beyond the talent in our ranks and 
also includes youth within our home communities. 
Why? We know the power of education to expand 
opportunities, generate wealth, and afﬁ  rm human 
dignity, and we believe everyone deserves a high-
quality education. That’s why in 2021 the 
John Deere Foundation made a public commitment 
to ensure equitable access to education to at 
least one million marginalized youth in our home 
communities by 2030.
 In 2023, the Foundation served more than 
113,000 youth across 35 company locations in 
eight countries through John Deere Inspire. 
Through this Science Technology Engineering and 
Mathematics (STEM) initiative, we have built and 
expanded a stack of offerings, including FIRST , 
Project Lead The Way, and MIND Research’s ST 
Math, to provide all youth in our communities with 
the skills and experiences needed for the careers 
of the future. Since the launch of John Deere 
Inspire more than 10 years ago, the Foundation 
has invested nearly $14 million in its key programs.
 
To advance the development of youth in our 
communities, hundreds of our employees serve 
as mentors, coaches, and volunteers to provide 
youth with the expertise, guidance, and a sense 
of belonging that are vital for them to explore 
and pursue education and careers in STEM. In 
2023, company employees recorded nearly 70,000 
hours of volunteerism through John Deere 
Inspire and other educational programs. 
And the Foundation’s commitment to FIRST  
continues to grow with our new support for 
the FIRST  LEGO League Challenge qualiﬁ  ers in 
Germany and France. 
 
FIRST LEGO League is one of three FIRST  
programs the John Deere Foundation sponsors. 
The Challenge division is designed for youth ages 
9–16 globally and 9–14 in North America. For 
the 2022–23 season, we were a global program 
sponsor for  FIRST  LEGO League Challenge, 
supporting 280,000 youth in over 100 countries. 
Our involvement makes us one of the top three 
team sponsors for FIRST  LEGO League Challenge 
and second for total FIRST  teams supported.This past season’s challenge was themed 
“Superpowered,” which provided students the 
opportunity to explore where energy comes from 
and aligns with our work in sustainability.
“The number of youths reached, the dollars 
invested, and the number of volunteer hours 
achieved don’t do justice to the true impact 
of John Deere Inspire. Last year alone, the 
Foundation’s investments meant nearly four 
million hours of top-tier STEM education for 
youth in our local communities. ”

 43At John Deere, we take great pride in our work 
because we know the solutions we create and 
the products we manufacture genuinely enhance 
the lives of those who rely on us. We strive to 
enhance the lives of our customers every day. 
But we are also driven to make a meaningful 
difference in the lives of our neighbors 
near and far. As a company, we take on the 
world’s toughest challenges with compassion, 
innovation, and an unwavering commitment to 
improving the world we live in.
In 2023, our employees volunteered a record 
261,214 hours to support nearly 5,000 nonproﬁ  t 
organizations around the world. For their 
volunteerism and personal giving, John Deere 
employees also earned nearly $9 million in rewards

In addition, we work to amplify the voices of 
our customers. In 2023, we collaborated with Al 
Roker Entertainment to create a documentary 
titled “Gaining Ground: The Fight for Black 
Land” as part of our LEAP (legislation, education, 
advocacy, and production systems) Coalition.
In collaboration with the National Black Growers 
Council and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, 
our LEAP Coalition was established in 2020 to 
help eliminate barriers created by heirs’ property 
and provide resources to advance the lives and 
livelihoods of Black farmers. In November 2022, 
the Center for Heirs’ Property Preservation 
(CHPP) joined LEAP as its newest member. The 
Leap Coalition, along with the CHPP have seen 
great success this year with 27 titles cleared and 
354 wills drafted.The documentary, “Gaining Ground”, spread 
awareness on the injustice in Black farming 
in America and the devastating impact of 
heirs’ property – property passed to family 
members by inheritance, usually without a will 
or proper estate planning. Highlights since the 
documentary’s release in June 2023 include: 
Private screening at the Smithsonian’s 
National Museum of African American 
History & Culture in Washington, D.C.

 44THE HEART OF VOLUNTEERISM
Through our other documentary of the year — 
“Odd Hours, No Pay, Cool Hat” — John Deere and the National 
Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC) shine a spotlight on the critical 
role volunteer ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters and emergency responders play 
while also calling upon others to replenish their shrinking ranks. 
Inspired by an original story by Peter Y oakum, “Odd Hours” 
reveals that nearly 700,000 Americans, or two-thirds of the 
nation’s ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters, volunteer to provide most of the country 
with ﬁ  re and emergency services. From Monsey, New Y ork, to 
Exeter, Nebraska, to Graton, California, volunteer ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters 
from all walks of life leave their homes, workplaces, and places 
of worship to help others when they need help the most. 
John Deere, the company’s founder, was himself a volunteer 
ﬁ  reﬁ  ghter and community servant. His legacy lives on 
through the hundreds of Deere employees, dealer personnel, 
and customers who provide their communities with this 
vital service.

 45For farmers to have an opportunity to leap forward economically, socially, and 
environmentally, they must ﬁ  rst have their feet planted ﬁ  rmly in rich, healthy soil. Farmers' 
land is their most important asset in every respect. Soil can provide them with the nutrients, 
water, organic material, microbes, chemistry, and other resources critical to the successful 
growth of their crops. Healthy soil produces healthy crops, which feed healthy people, who 
create livelihoods, enrich food systems, and protect ecosystems. 
Because of the fundamental importance of soil health, particularly in sustaining and 
uplifting millions of the world’s most vulnerable smallholder farmers, the John Deere 
Foundation supports the work of One Acre Fund and The Nature Conservancy®. Through 
soil health, agroforestry, and conservation efforts, these organizations work to ensure the 
land will provide for farmers and all of us today and into the future.
FARMERS FIRST MEANS SOIL FIRST
One Acre Fund’s “farmer-ﬁ  rst model” is as simple as it is brilliant — One Acre Fund provides 
farmers with everything they need to grow more food and earn more money. Since its 
founding in 2006 and by staying true to its model, One Acre Fund has grown across sub-
Saharan Africa to reach more than four million farm households in 2022.1
SOIL STEWARDSHIP: In 2023, One Acre Fund 
expanded its promotion of soil health-improving 
practices, such as intercropping, crop diversiﬁ  cation, 
composting, mulching, and lime application, as well 
as detailed agronomic guidance on input choice, 
planting timing, and farming techniques. In Tanzania, 
One Acre Fund promoted the expansion of soil 
testing, reaching 2,000 farm households. CREATING OPPORTUNITY 
FROM THE GROUND UP
To its impressive array of programs, 
One Acre Fund has added a variety 
of resources intended to support 
farmers in maintaining and improving 
the productivity of their soil .

 46Because of the impact of One Acre 
Fund’s work on the lives of farmers like 
Dusabimana, the John Deere Foundation 
awarded the organization a ﬁ  ve-year 
grant totaling $7 .5 million to support its 
operations. This is the largest grant in 
the Foundation’s history. Through this 
grant, the Foundation will help 750,000 
farmers unlock upwards of $64.8 million 
in economic value.While One Acre Fund’s reach has 
grown, its success continues to be 
measured one farm family at a time. 
“I have experienced a better life since 
I started working with One Acre Fund,” 
Consolee Dusabimana, an agroforestry 
farmer in Rwanda, said. “Trees are 
important to the community, to the 
country, and to everyone. Personally, 
the trees are very important because 
when I produce them, I earn money 
that helps me to pay the health 
insurance for my family and also buy 
the fertilizers that I get from One Acre 
Fund, buy school materials for the 
children, and so forth.”

AGROFORESTRY: In 2022, One Acre Fund 
supported more than 2.8 million farmers 
in planting 62 million trees covering 45 
species.2 The beneﬁ  ts of agroforestry 
to farmers include carbon sequestration, 
slowing deforestation, soil protection, 
biodiversity, and providing a valuable 
long-term crop (wood) asset that can be 
used or sold in time of need. One Acre 
Fund has a goal of planting one billion 
trees cumulatively by 2030.

 47FROM FARMS TO FOODSCAPES
The health of a farm depends not only on its soil but also on the 
health of the larger geography that surrounds it. The Nature 
Conservancy refers to these geographies as “foodscapes,” which are 
the geographical components of the global food system, combining 
both production systems as well as location. Through a foodscape lens, 
we can gain a greater appreciation for how food production depends 
upon a healthy environment. 
To protect and strengthen some of the world’s most vulnerable 
foodscapes and the farmers who depend upon them, the John Deere 
Foundation has joined with The Nature Conservancy to conduct forest 
restoration, agroforestry, and conservation on a global scale. Speciﬁ  cally, 
we will work together in Gran Chaco in Argentina, Araguaia in Brazil, 
Kalimantan in Indonesia, Chiapas in Mexico, and the United States to 
restore degraded and deforested areas with native plants; combine 
where possible native tree species, fruit trees, and crops; and 
conserve old-growth forests and other ecologically important biodiverse 
natural habitats. In addition, Shinkai stated, “When we talk about 
conservation, we’re already thinking in the medium to long 
term. It’s not about the next crop season, but about ﬁ  ve 
or ten years ahead. These practices don’t yield short-term 
results; results are built over time. If you take care and 
implement these practices, you will see lasting results.”
To support this work, the John Deere Foundation awarded 
The Nature Conservancy a ﬁ  ve-year grant totaling $6.5 
million. This is the second largest grant in the Foundation’s 
history. Through this grant the Foundation will assist in the 
planting and protection of 12 million trees, with the aim of 
generating income for marginalized farmers, enhancing 
biodiversity, and strengthening vital ecosystems. OUR FOUNDATION OVER TIME
Since its founding in 1948, the Foundation has awarded over $400 
million, with more than $100 million granted in the last ﬁ  ve years alone.  
Over its 75 years, the John Deere Foundation has been a vital source of support for families 
who live, work, and learn in the communities in which the company operates, particularly 
during the most challenging times. From donations made to further the Civil Rights Movement, 
to recover from the Farm Crisis of the 1980s, and to eliminate the inequity revealed by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the Foundation responds to the ever-changing needs of those close to us. 
But what separates the John Deere Foundation from others is its drive to do more than 
simply respond, but instead act in ways that may prevent harm from occurring in the ﬁ  rst 
place. For instance, as a pioneer in trust-based philanthropy, the Foundation has transitioned 
largely to unrestricted, capacity-building, and long-term grantmaking to nonproﬁ  t 
organizations. These types of grants provide the nonproﬁ  t organizations essential to the 
health of a community, including food banks, with the consistency and ﬂ  exibility they need 
not only to respond more effectively, but also innovate new solutions to the root causes of 
the challenges our neighbors face.
Our commitment remains evident in our most recent series of grants, totaling $19 million, to 
eliminate hunger by increasing access to food, uplifting resource-constrained farmers, and 
supporting the global food system. Awarded to World Food Program USA, One Acre Fund, and 
The Nature Conservancy, these are the three largest grants in the Foundation’s history and 
strengthen John Deere’s commitment to creating a world in which food is a moral right for all.
It’s this type of consistent commitment and vision that helped us earn the Civic 50 award from 
Points of Light two years in a row. The award recognizes the top 50 most community-minded 
companies in the U.S.
“To honor the legacies of John Deere and the John Deere Foundation, we 
must constantly challenge ourselves to ﬁ  nd new ways to give more, and 
give more effectively, to the communities we proudly serve. As a matter of 
principle, we have always believed that all our neighbors deserve both the 
opportunity to make a better life as well as the dignity of having the help 
of others. This principle will guide us far into the future.”

At John Deere, we are committed to honoring human rights and respect 
the individual dignity of all people. Our commitment to human rights 
requires that we understand and carry out our responsibilities consistent 
with company values and practices upheld for all employees and workers 
in our value chain. Deere works to analyze its human rights impacts in line 
with the UN Guiding Principles on Businesses and Human Rights and other 
frameworks as appropriate. 
We strive to ensure that human rights are upheld for our employees and 
all workers in our value chain. Our commitment to respecting human rights 
is deﬁ  ned in our Code of Business Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct, 
Dealer Code of Conduct, and John Deere’s Support of Human Rights in 
Our Business Practices. These codes establish clear guidelines for our 
employees, dealers, and suppliers, while helping to inform our business 
decisions. Deere closely monitors and assesses global human rights-
related risks and developments as approppriate. Deere develops region- or 
location-speciﬁ  c guidance and processes as appropriate to address human 
rights risks in those areas. 
John Deere employees have a responsibility to uphold the standards of 
honor and integrity in the Code of Business Conduct. All employees are 
required to review the Code and incorporate it into their work and behavior. 
To foster an inclusive workplace, the Code provides guidance on creating 
an environment that promotes mutual respect and acceptance. It also 
discusses how to maintain a high level of integrity when working with 
customers and suppliers. 
When choosing suppliers, we seek to engage with those who comply with 
laws and uphold values aligned with our own. Our employees regularly 
discuss the Supplier Code of Conduct with suppliers, and most supplier 
contracts require adherence to the Supplier Code of Conduct. The Supplier 
Code addresses the following key areas: labor and human rights, health and 
safety, environment, and ethics. See the Supply Management section for 
more information on how we manage supply chain human rights risks. 
As the face of the brand to our customers, our dealers, distributors, and 
their sub-dealers (collectively, dealers) commit to conducting business 
ethically and in compliance with all applicable laws. Like the other Codes, 
the Dealer Code covers many topics, including labor, human rights, health 
and safety, environment, and ethics.HUMAN RIGHTS

 49THE SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OF OUR PEOPLE 
IS A TOP PRIORITY . WITH THAT COMES OUR 
COMMITMENT TO IMPROVE OUR TOTAL 
RECORDABLE INCIDENT RATE (TRIR) 20% 
BY 2026, USING 2021 AS THE BASELINE.
We made progress on implementing best practices 
and leading indicators for enhancing employee 
safety over recent years with our Deere Health and 
Safety Management System. Third-party safety 
audits are conducted at locations based on level of 
risk. Conducted at least every four years, these audits 
review the effectiveness of the Health and Safety 
Management System, adherence to applicable 
John Deere health and safety standards, and 
compliance with regulatory requirements. 
To improve our TRIR, we continue to prioritize risk- 
and injury-reduction strategies, improved ergonomic 
programs, and additional focus on prevention 
through design. Production employees new to a job are statistically more likely to be injured. Several of 
our facilities have instituted safety-focused projects aimed at helping to develop our new 
employee workforce:
WATERLOO (IOWA) WORKS FACTORY’S NEW EMPLOYEE TRAINING LAB:
With the increase in new hires, we updated the tractor and cab 
assembly operations training lab and curriculum to enhance 
manufacturing skills for our new workforce to mitigate risks related 
to safety and ergonomics:
- Introduced six new assembly stations and one proﬁ  ciency station, impacting IT 
infrastructure, hand tooling, ﬁ  xturing, jib, and Below the Hook Lifting 
Devices. 
- Updated training messaging with safety and ergonomic emphasis (biomechanics).
- All training stations have recorded videos explaining the station and emphasizing 
important safety points. 
DUBUQUE (IOWA) WORKS FACTORY’S NEW EMPLOYEE INTERACTIONS:
By proactively engaging with operators new to the job through 
an updated operator safety interaction, we aim to prevent injuries. 
The operator safety interaction includes: 
- Regular engagement between the new operator and a cross-functional team 
consisting of a UAW safety representative, a safety professional, a nontraditional 
assignment employee, and an ergonomics professional. 
- Speciﬁ  c meetings to review personal protective equipment work instructions, 
lifting-devices usage, stop-work authority, tooling, and out-of-process work.
MOTORES JOHN DEERE (TORREON, MEXICO) FACTORY’S NEW EMPLOYEE
ONBOARDING PROCESS:
- New employees wear a vest of a different color each week to demonstrate each step
in the onboarding process.
- A four-week onboarding process of new hires allows everyone to help pay special 
attention to risks until the new employee is proﬁ  cient in their operations. SAFETY

and is responsible for aligning strategic priorities and ensuring, environmental, 
social, and governance principles are integrated throughout the enterprise. 
The Corporate Governance Committee of the Board reviews sustainability 
topics with management on a quarterly basis. During 2023, the committee 
was briefed on strategic sustainability initiatives, the evolving U.S. and global 
regulatory environment for sustainability reporting, new sustainability reporting 
standards and frameworks, the company’s transition to integrated business and 
sustainability reporting, the company’s climate reporting road map, feedback from 
stakeholder engagement, and the landscape of shifting sustainability expectations

strategic sustainability planning, sustainability goal setting, and the scope of 
sustainability reporting. 
The Compensation Committee of the Board is responsible for ensuring 
compensation is aligned with the strategic priorities, performance, and 
opportunities of the company. In 2023, we broadened our inclusion of 
sustainability components through qualitative assessments in executive 
compensation programs. For more information see the 2024 Proxy Statement.
The full Board of Directors has oversight of the risks and opportunities 
associated with climate change, and updates are provided to the board in 
alignment with our Enterprise Risk Management processes. This year, the full 
Board of Directors received an overview of the current status of sustainability 
initiatives from across the enterprise, with a primary focus on initiatives that are 
driving progress on the Leap Ambitions. Additional detail about the Board’s and 
the company’s governance of climate change can be found in our Task Force on

strategy and governance. This centralized team is responsible for driving, 
measuring, and reporting sustainability strategies and initiatives at Deere. 
The team coordinates across the enterprise to measure and report progress 
on Leap Ambitions and other sustainability metrics, evolve core processes, 
and engage with external stakeholders to communicate the Smart 
Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions. This team also partners 
with the company’s technical accounting and internal audit experts to build 
robust processes and rigor related to sustainability reporting, and oversees 
the company’s external assurance of its sustainability metrics. In addition, 
the team relies on a broad group of subject matter experts throughout 
the organization to execute Leap Ambitions through the development and

and resources throughout the organization, reviewing progress and 
challenges, and driving execution of initiatives to meet the goals. Goal 
owners have speciﬁ  c ownership of the actions driving the steps needed 
to achieve the Leap Ambitions. Goal owners guide the efforts of the 
sustainability workstreams. 
SUSTAINABILITY WORKSTREAMS
A global, cross-functional team of subject matter experts is critical to 
the execution of John Deere’s strategic priorities. Working together 
on execution workstreams, they develop the implementation plans for 
achieving our sustainability initiatives and engage progress to ensure 
the delivery of action plans. These teams also serve a key role in keeping 
the organization informed relative to progress and roadblocks as they 
track and report metrics on a regular basis. Sustainability Workstreams 
are comprised of individuals with deep technical knowledge in their 
respective areas of expertise who are helping us solve the most difﬁ  cult 
challenges in order to achieve our Leap Ambitions.

YOU HAVE A ROBUST BACKGROUND IN TECHNOLOGY 
STRATEGY . HOW DOES YOUR EXPERTISE TIE INTO THE WORK 
DEERE IS DOING?
Part of what we do at Roper Technologies is help the 
businesses in our portfolio develop strategies that clearly 
deﬁ  ne where to play and how to win. With the work Deere is 
doing with innovative technologies and technology-enabled 
products, they’re thinking generations ahead with big solutions 
to some of the world’s largest challenges. So there’s a lot of 
synergies there. We help our great businesses get even better 
over a long arc of time. I especially appreciate that about John 
Deere – they’re focused on how they can consistently create 
customer value by helping them do their jobs better and more 
efﬁ  ciently. And that’s a solid recipe for long-term success. 
WHAT ARE YOU MOST LOOKING FORWARD TO WHILE 
WORKING WITH DEERE? 
I’d highlight two things here. First, as I mentioned, Deere is 
focused on helping solve some big challenges – like combating 
hunger and providing the infrastructure the world needs 
to ﬂ  ourish and thrive – and I’m excited to be a part of that 
innovation. Second, I’m a big fan of the work Deere is doing 
with their team and talent. People are the key to a sustainable 
competitive advantage – they are the composers of ideas and 
the architects of innovation. Any time a company authentically 
focuses so well on its culture and its people, I’m all in.  Charles O. Holliday, Jr. (15)

 57Data and connectivity are a critical part of 
our work at John Deere and in our customers’ 
operations. We have dedicated cybersecurity 
teams around the globe that are committed 
to helping protect our customers, dealers, 
products, and infrastructure.
 
Our approach to digital security can be 
found here. 
The Board of Directors’ Audit Review 
Committee and Corporate Governance 
Committee provide oversight of our 
cybersecurity and data privacy programs. 
The Chief Information Security Ofﬁ  cer 
(CISO) oversees our global cybersecurity 
strategy and manages teams around the 
globe that are committed to protecting our customers, dealers, products, and 
infrastructure. Information on the latest 
cybersecurity trends, strategic initiatives, 
and metrics are presented quarterly to the 
board by our CISO. Subject matter experts in 
areas such as risk management, identity and 
access management, product security, and 
information technology (IT) may present at 
these quarterly updates as well. Our digital 
risk governance council and executive 
business conduct council provide senior 
leadership oversight on information security 
governance, data governance, digital risk 
management, and privacy. 
We leverage the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity 
Framework (CSF) as the foundational building block of our global information security 
program. In addition to internal audits 
that include information security policies, 
standards, and guidelines, we work with third 
parties to assess the maturity of our program 
within the NIST CSF and develop strategic 
areas of focus from those assessments.
Building a companywide culture of 
cybersecurity starts with education. Our 
goal is to teach employees about key 
security concepts, trends, and the role 
each employee plays in helping to prevent 
cyberattacks. Deere’s digital security 
organization has worked to engage 
employees in its efforts through multiple 
forms of regular training and education to 
include mandatory onboarding training, phishing simulations, newsletters, and 
educational events.
Another key part of our cybersecurity 
culture is the Security by Design 
program. It combines people, processes, 
and technologies to integrate security 
concepts throughout the product 
development lifecycle. Our cybersecurity 
professionals partner with software 
engineers in the development process and 
use technologies, such as code scanning, 
to enhance security.
We also take care to respect people’s 
privacy in handling personal data. Our data 
privacy program is structured to monitor 
and adapt to comply with changes in global privacy laws and regulations. Our 
privacy practices can be found here.
While the European General Data 
Protection Regulation and other laws 
have brought increased requirements and 
general awareness to privacy, we have long 
focused on ensuring the responsible use of 
personal data. We maintain our European 
Binding Corporate Rules, often considered 
the global gold standard for the transfer 
and processing of personal data in Europe. 
Reflecting our commitment to privacy, 
we routinely submit significant parts of 
our global privacy program to European 
regulators for review, as appropriate.CYBERSECURITY

 58Our Supply Management and Logistics 
teams remain committed to applying the 
foundational importance of compliance 
in meeting customer needs. This is done 
through promoting sustainability and further 
developments in technology and supplier 
relationships.
This governance aligns with our Leap 
Ambitions and our strategic sourcing 
approach, which considers sustainability 
a key action area, balanced with ongoing 
expectations for quality, cost, and delivery. 
This strategy guides our search for supplier 
opportunities that further our 2030 
goals — those relating to greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions reduction, increased use 
of sustainable materials, and recyclable 
materials. To help our suppliers achieve 
sustainability success, we encourage 
alignment with EcoVadis. John Deere utilizes 
EcoVadis to assess suppliers in an objective 
and independent way. The assessment 
looks at corporate social responsibility and 
sustainability management systems. 
Over 1,650 supplier locations have 
completed sustainability scorecards, 
equating to 65% of our Tier 1 supplier 
spend engaging with sustainability 
assessments. 
These assessments have allowed us to 
develop a deeper understanding of a 
supplier’s current state, aspirations, and 
progress toward sustainable outcomes.With regards to human rights, we use 
multiple tools to complete a risk analysis 
on our supply base and utilize Everstream 
Analytics, EcoVadis IQ, EcoVadis scorecards, 
and internal audit results as well as 
commercial information to establish a risk 
proﬁ  le index (RPI) related to human rights. 
Based on the RPI, suppliers are added to 
our Supply Chain Risk Management process, 
and additional veriﬁ  cation or audits are 
completed as appropriate to help reduce the 
overall risk rating. Key factors of the 
risk analysis include country and industry risk 
ratings, speciﬁ  c environmental and labor and 
human rights risk evaluations, environmental 
audits, quality audits, sustainability 
scorecards, and spend level.
We also have sustainability and human 
rights ingrained within our Supplier Code 
of Conduct. Our enhanced sustainability 
expectations cover multiple areas, including 
the environment, labor and human rights, 
ethics, and sustainable procurement. Click 
here to view the Supplier Code of Conduct.
Finally, we continue to assess and work 
to advance supplier performance in areas 
like compliance and ﬁ  nancial health, using 
our corrective action process to provide 
suppliers with opportunities for continuous 
improvement. We manage the risks 
associated with critical materials as well. For 
more information, refer to the Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB).DIVERSE SUPPLIER SOURCING
We remain committed to enhancing diversity 
within our supply base. We believe our 
strategy increases competition and resiliency 
in our supply chain, fosters innovation 
through diversity of thought, and can 
generate economic value and create jobs in 
the communities in which we live and work. 
In 2023, Deere team members attended 
multiple conferences to connect with 
minority-, women-, and veteran-owned 
businesses and suppliers that are in 
historically underutilized business zones. 
These conferences include the Women 
Business Enterprise National Council 
Conference (WBENC), National Minority 
Supplier Development Council Conference 
(NMSDC), Michigan Minority Procurement 
Conference (MMPC), National Defense 
Industrial Association Iowa-Illinois Regional 
Conference, and HUBZone Conference. 
Advantage Capital’s Empower the Change 
Fund, in which Deere is a lead investor, 
made its ﬁ  rst two investments in 2023. The 
Empower the Change Fund seeks to invest 
in minority business enterprises (MBEs) that 
have demonstrated a proven ability to scale, 
generate return for investors, and create 
wealth opportunities for entrepreneurs and 
employees. We are pleased to see these 
ﬁ  rst two investments close, look forward to 
the company’s continued growth, and are 
conﬁ  dent this fund will continue to support 
scalable MBEs.SUPPLY MANAGEMENT

 59The Center for Global Business Conduct provides 
continuous training, communications, and best practices 
throughout our operations, allowing us to sustain our 
strong ethical culture and help ensure compliance with 
laws and regulations. 
The Code of Business Conduct and our framework 
of global ethics and compliance policies serve as the 
foundation for our compliance program and culture. 
The Supplier Code of Conduct and the Dealer Code 
of Conduct clarify the expectations we have for 
suppliers and dealers to conduct business in an ethical, 
compliant manner. 
Deere’s compliance training program includes a robust 
curriculum for newly hired employees, as well as regular, 
periodic training on a rotating list of topics for all 
employees. Training topics are deﬁ  ned by balancing 
data from our compliance program and enterprise risk 
management with legal and regulatory requirements.
For 2023, compliance training included, but was not 
limited to, the following topics: Code of Business 
Conduct, anti-bribery/corruption, cybersecurity and 
phishing, data privacy and protection, and workplace 
and sexual harassment. Training material is translated 
into as many as 20 languages and delivered and tracked 
through an online learning management system. We 
require all employees to complete training on our Code 
and, where permitted by law, also require that employees 
regularly certify compliance with the Code.
Providing our employees with a safe, secure reporting 
outlet remains a priority, and our compliance hotline is 
integral to that. Operated by an independent company, 
the hotline is available to receive conﬁ  dential reports 
from anyone within or outside the company. To access 
country-speciﬁ  c hotline information, employees can view the posters on display at each company location or 
visit the John Deere intranet. The John Deere Compliance 
Hotline website is listed in the Code of Business Conduct, the 
Dealer Code of Conduct, and the Supplier Code of Conduct.
Looking at the total of investigated and closed reports in 
2023, we see that 76% were in the category of how we treat 
each other in the workplace. This includes concerns of 
harassment or discrimination, threats or physical violence, 
employment law or policy violations, and retaliation. 7% of 
the investigated and closed reports involved allegations 
of accounting or ﬁ  nancial misconduct or legal/regulatory 
violations. The remaining 17% of investigated and closed 
reports fall into the general business integrity category, 
including concerns of the following: theft or misuse of 
company resources; conﬂ  icts of interest; and bribery, 
corruption, or improper gifts or entertainment. 
While we have a mature compliance program, we are 
always focused on continuous improvement, by making 
compliance guidance more relevant, risk based, timely, 
easy to use, and employee focused. Examples include: 
Training materials and resources, with helpful 
reminders delivered ahead of trade shows and 
major events.
A podcast featuring real-life cases from the 
hotline or examples of ethical business in action.
Enhancements to our hotline process and 
communications to increase trust and 
transparency.
Code of Business Conduct newly available in 
an engaging, interactive electronic format.To expand our reach, Compliance collaborated with 
Labor Relations to expand the use of email by production 
employees to deliver additional compliance training to that 
audience. In countries where email accounts have been 
set up for all production employees, those employees have 
completed training on the Code of Business Conduct and 
on cybersecurity and phishing.
In 2023, John Deere received World’s 
Most Ethical Companies recognition for 
the 16th time — making us one of only a 
handful of companies that have received 
this ongoing level of recognition.COMPLIANCE

 60At John Deere, we believe that participating 
in political processes around the world and 
advocating for public policies that permit us and our customers 
to compete fairly and freely in the marketplace are vitally 
important to all our stakeholders. In whatever form it might 
take, our engagement in the political process is grounded in and 
guided by our ﬁ  rm commitment to strong corporate governance 
and global corporate citizenship. 
John Deere advocates for good public policy to underscore 
its responsibility as a corporate citizen to participate in our 
communities. We engage in public policies such as trade, 
agricultural and infrastructure development, and regulations 
that impact how John Deere operates around the world. We 
seek to promote policies that provide solutions for food security, 
rural connectivity, technology innovation, ag mechanization, 
infrastructure development, renewable fuels and alternative 
power, and tax and ﬁ  nancing access that impacts our customers. 
As a part of these efforts, we engage with like-minded 
companies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and 
associations as well as participate in public-private partnerships, 
to reach global audiences and policymakers. 
Examples of recent U.S. advocacy to highlight the beneﬁ  ts of 
precision agriculture and climate-smart practices associated 
with renewable fuels include engagement in California’s 
Low Carbon Fuel Standard, the U.S. Federal Renewable Fuel 
Standard, the Inﬂ  ation Reduction Act, and the U.S. Farm Bill. On 
a global level, recent examples of advocacy include sustainable 
agricultural mechanization, expanding rural connectivity in 
Brazil, carbon farming and alternative fuels in the EU, and 
engagement in geospatial data discussions in India.

Goals, targets, intentions, ambitions, or expectations 
described in this report, including the Leap Ambitions, are 
aspirational and subject to change and are not guarantees 
or promises that all goals, targets, intentions, ambitions, or 
expectations will be met. The United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (UNSDGs) are also aspirational in 
nature. The analysis involved in determining whether 
and how certain initiatives may contribute to the UNSDGs 
is inherently subjective and dependent on a number of 
factors. There can be no assurance that reasonable parties 
will agree on a decision as to whether certain projects, 
initiatives, investments, or other aspects of our business 
contribute to a particular UNSDG. Accordingly, investors 
should not place undue reliance on Deere’s application of 
the UNSDGs, as such application is subject to change at 
any time and in Deere’s sole discretion. Similarly, there can 
be no assurance that our sustainability or ESG policies and 
procedures as described in this report will continue; such 
policies and procedures could change, even materially. 
We are permitted to determine in our discretion that 
it is not feasible or practical to implement or complete 
certain of our sustainability or ESG initiatives, policies, and 
procedures based on cost, timing, or other considerations. 
Further, the receipt of any awards by Deere is no assurance that Deere’s business objectives, including its LEAP 
Ambitions or other sustainability objectives, have been 
achieved or successful.

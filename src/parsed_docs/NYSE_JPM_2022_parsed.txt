set our Sustainable Development Target (the “Target”) with the goal to fnance and  

facilitate more than $2.5 trillion over 10 years—from 2021 through the end of 2030— 

to advance long-term solutions that address climate change and contribute to sus-

tainable development. Our end-of-2030 goal corresponds with the timeframe we set  

to meet our initial emission intensity reduction targets within our fnancing portfolio  

(see page 17), as well as the timeframe set by the United Nations for achieving the  

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”). The Target aims to grow and  

strengthen our business activities across three important objectives—Green, Devel-

opment Finance and Community Development—and, at the same time, highlight the  

work we’re doing through our lines of businesses and Racial Equity Commitment. 

In developing the Target's criteria and methodology, we also took into account inter-

national best practices and industry standards, such as the SDGs, the International  

Capital Market Association’s Green and Social Bond Principles, and the International  

Finance Corporation’s Anticipated Impact Measurement and Monitoring system.

Progress Toward the Target 

PROGRESS TOWARD 10-YEAR TARGET 

We track progress toward our Target by attributing business activity across the  

Firm that supports our Target’s objectives. These business activities include  

transactions fnanced or facilitated by the Firm and those for which we are pro-

viding advisory, risk management and other facilitation services.  

Progress toward our Target, like our other ESG-related initiatives, is subject to certain  

prerequisites, including market conditions, public policy and technological advance-

ment. Our fnancing and advisory initiatives are also subject to the same macroeco-

nomic conditions that impact our franchise and the broader fnancial markets.  

In 2022, our progress toward our Target was characterized by a challenging mac-

roeconomic environment. Volatile market conditions, including rising rates con-

tributed to slower progress toward our Target compared to 2021. T  he challenging  

macroeconomic environment was not limited to sustainable development activi-

ties. For example, according to Dealogic1, global investment banking fees in 2022 

were down 42% compared to 2021. We saw a similar, but lesser, decline in Invest-

ment Banking activities counted toward our Target. Market conditions, public pol-

icy and technological advancement will continue to have an impact on our 

results, and as such, we do not expect our progress over the decade to be linear.

OUR APPROACH TO TRANSACTIONS THAT SUPPORT 
MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES 

The three objectives of our Target—Green, Development Finance,  

and Community Development—refect our belief that creating sus-

tainable economic growth requires advancing environmental, eco-

nomic and social goals. When tracking these transactions to our  

Target, we count transactions only once and toward only one  

objective in the following order (as applicable): Green, Develop-

ment Finance or Community Development. With this approach, we  

seek to avoid double counting, simplify tracking toward our prog-

ress, and create clarity in our disclosures. We disclose more infor-

mation on a few of these key areas in the coming sections, such as  

how we track and count Sustainability Bonds and certain JPM DFI  

activity toward our Green objective. We aim to be transparent in  

our methodology and may recalibrate our approach over time. 

Our work with the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance  

Corporation (“CFC”) provides an example of the mutual benefts  

that can be created by simultaneously supporting the advance-

ment of environmental and social issues. CFC, created and owned  

by the U.S.’s electric cooperative network, is a nonproft, private  

lender focused on providing fnancing to over 900 rural electric  

cooperatives in the U.S. Electric cooperatives, which trace their  

origin back to the U.S. federal government’s New Deal Initiative,  

were created by farmers and local residents to provide afordable  

and dependable electricity in rural communities. In August 2022,  

JPMorgan Chase served as joint book-running manager on CFC’s  

$400 million sustainability bond, the proceeds of which CFC plans  

to use to support broadband access for underserved and rural  

populations in the United States. Prior to this, in 2020, JPMorgan  

Chase also served as joint book-running manager and sustainabil-

ity bond structuring agent for CFC’s inaugural sustainability bond.  

These two issuances represent the only sustainability bonds so far  

in the electric cooperative sector.

PROGRESS TOWARD THE 10-YEAR GREEN TARGET 

Our $1 trillion green objective is intended to support climate action and sustainable resource management. Developing  

solutions sufcient to meet the climate challenge will require signifcant capital, including capital to deploy and scale  

clean energy solutions to meet the world’s growing energy needs. Capital is also required to promote the sustainable  

management of resources, including water and forests. These aims support each other; some actions that address cli-

mate change, such as reforestation, also have positive impacts on nature, biodiversity and the sustainable management  

of resources. Eligible green activities include areas such as renewable and clean energy, clean technology, sustainable  

transportation and water management.

around our Firm, such as raising capital for clean technology companies and providing consumer auto fnancing for  

electric vehicles. Many of the eligible transactions counted toward our green objective can be used for multiple eligible  

activities (e.g., a green bond where proceeds can be used for both renewable energy and water) and are therefore cat-

egorized as “multiple criteria.” We show a breakdown of the types of transactions included in the multiple criteria cate-

INTRODUCTION 

The development fnance objective of the Target highlights the work of the J.P. Morgan Development Finance Institution  

(“JPM DFI”), which works to mobilize capital toward sustainable development projects in developing countries. The JPM  

DFI qualifes CIB transactions with anticipated environmental and socioeconomic impacts. The JPM DFI also acts as  

development fnance structuring agent (“DFSA”) for a diverse set of corporate and sovereign transactions, which

A healthy environment is crucial to the long-term success of the economy and of communities around the 

world, but climate change, biodiversity loss and other environmental challenges pose increasing threats to 

our collective future. 

As a global fnancial institution working with clients in nearly every sector of the economy, we have an  

important role to play in supporting our clients’ environmental objectives and helping advance a sustain-

BIODIVERSITY AND NATURAL CAPITAL 

Natural capital refers to the stock of natural resources,  

including soil, air, water and living things that provide valu-

able goods and services for society and the broader economy,  

and that are critical to supporting physical and economic  

health. Over-exploitation of natural capital is threatening bio-

diversity and compromising the ability of ecosystems to miti-

gate climate change. 

The Firm recognizes the need for advancements in policies,  

data and disclosure to enable accurate valuation of natural  

capital and the identifcation and management of nature-re-

lated risks and opportunities for our clients, operations and  

business strategy. We continue to foster ongoing engagement  

with internal and external stakeholders in regards to cli-

mate-related matters and emerging nature and biodiversity  

issues. In 2022, we joined the Taskforce on Nature-related  

Financial Disclosures (“TNFD”) Forum and look forward to con-

tinuing to engage with the TNFD as it fnalizes its framework. 

We recognize nature is important for efective climate action 

and support our clients’ eforts that aim to protect natural 

capital, for example, through our Green Bond underwriting 

(see page 15). We have also directed resources to promote 

biodiversity conservation by selecting nature-based carbon 

removal ofsets for our operational emissions that we are not 

yet able to eliminate (see page 21), and we have published 

research that explores the fnancial impact of biodiversity loss 

and strategies to address deforestation and nature decline in 

the global food system. 

The Firm also manages certain E&S risks, which may include  

nature-related risks, in our lines of business. For more infor-

mation on how we manage risk in our business, see page 56.

We also support the market through our own Green Bond issuances. These issu-

ances are governed by our Sustainable Bond Framework and allocate an amount  

equal to the net proceeds to eligible green projects which may include green build-

ings, renewable energy and sustainable transportation. In October 2022, we  

updated our Sustainable Bond Framework which will govern our own Green Bond  

issuances going forward.  

At J.P. Morgan Asset Management (“JPMAM”), we believe that understanding the  

risk and opportunities related to global sustainability creates long-term value for  

our clients. For this reason, we continually strive to enhance our investment capabil-

ities and our eforts to help clients consider the material implications of ESG factors  

within their portfolios. 

We ofer dedicated sustainable investment solutions to clients who seek to generate  

long-term returns and contribute to sustainable outcomes. For example, in 2022, we  

launched 11 funds within our sustainable product suite, including a new fxed income  

product. T  hese products invest in businesses that we believe are providing solutions  

to global sustainability challenges such as climate risk management, preserving bio-

diversity, retroftting and constructing resilient transport and infrastructure, and  

fostering social advancement.

ing our continuing commitment, credibility, and transparency to our stewardship 

responsibilities: active engagement with the companies in which we invest and exer-

cising our voice as a long-term investor in the best interest of our client accounts. 

In 2022, we published our J.P. Morgan Asset Management 2022 Inaugural Report  

aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial  

Disclosures (“TCFD”). The report outlines how we are considering climate-related  

risks and opportunities relevant to our Asset Management business, across the  

areas of Governance, Risk Management, Strategy, and Metrics & Targets.

to support their purchases.  

in sustainability-themed investing, we have expanded our range of available the-

matic strategies and funds. For example, in 2022, we added a growth equity cli-

mate solutions investment fund focused on decarbonization, energy efciency,  

resource conservation and emissions management.  

We have invested in tools and solutions to help clients achieve their Sustainable  

Investing goals. In June 2021, we acquired OpenInvest, a values-based investing  

fnancial technology company to expand our toolkit of diagnostic capabilities,  

reporting, and solutions to help clients to align their investments with their val-

We aim to keep our clients up to date on the latest trends by publishing Sustainable

importance of megatrends such as circular economy biodiversity and agricultural 

technology; and how to think about sustainable investing alongside charitable giving. 

The EV landscape is complex and evolving quickly, and information can be hard to  

fnd or understand for consumers. The Chase Auto EV Education Center, a website,  

helps consumers learn about, fnd and purchase electric and hybrid vehicles, includ-

We are also working to increase fnancing to support EV adoption, including enter-

ing into private label relationships with EV manufacturers to provide fexible fnanc-

ing options to consumers. 

Supporting Our Clients 

We continue to broaden our eforts to support the climate- and sustainability-re-

lated banking needs of wholesale clients, from early-stage and small companies  

through to multinationals and other large corporations. We deploy our capital and  

expertise to assist clients working to transition their business model and operations  

to reduce emissions. As we expand our capabilities across our lines of business, we  

are able to provide clients with increasingly diverse and innovative solutions, while  

helping to grow the market for green and sustainable fnancing.  

CASE STUDY  ØRSTED 

When Ørsted was formed, the result of a merger among six Dan-

ish energy companies, including Danish Oil & Natural Gas, their 

power and heat production mix was 85% fossil fuel—mostly 

coal—as well as oil and gas production and exploration assets in 

the North Sea. Over a decade ago, their leadership decided to 

become a renewable energy  company. The company has 

reported reduction of its carbon emissions by 89% since 2006 

and reported that the share of green energy in their energy 

generation rose to 90% by the end of 2021. Throughout the 

stages of their transition, as part of a relationship spanning 

more than 20 years, JPMorgan Chase has provided, and contin-

ues to provide, Ørsted with diversifed services across our frm

GLOBAL MARKETS SUSTAINABILITY CENTER 

Within CIB Markets, the Global Markets Sustainability Center (“GMSC”) provides sus-

tainability solutions across asset classes to help clients who seek to realize their  

sustainability strategies and transition their portfolios to a low-carbon economy. For  

example, in 2022, GMSC developed a climate transition framework, working with a  

large institutional client by leveraging in-house expertise and looking at traditional  

and non-traditional climate data (e.g. news analytics). This unique solution allows  

for a practical multi-asset strategy solution to address the client’s needs for imple-

mentable carbon reduction targets as part of their net-zero ambitions. 

To refect the evolving client demand for ESG Research, we appointed a Head of ESG  

Methodology & Integration, who reports to our Co-Heads of ESG Research. We also  

launched ESG Discovery, our frst digital platform for ESG research content in the  

EMEA region to centrally house all ESG inputs from our sector and ESG analysts, and  

address clients’ needs for both thematic deep-dives and stock-specifc views. The  

platform leverages artifcial intelligence (“AI”) designed to identify the most rele-

vant ESG themes for specifc sectors and stocks and to centralize views on the expo-

sure to and management of these ESG themes by company, allowing clients to  

screen for and compare companies, as well as access suggested engagement ques-

tions f  rom our sector analysts.  

The Firm also facilitated dialogue between investors, companies and regulators on  

key ESG issues by hosting our 7th Global ESG Conference in 2022, which was  

attended by over 700 participants globally.

IMPROVING EFFICIENCY AND ACCELERATING ELECTRIFICATION 

Optimizing the Firm’s use of energy is not only essential for reducing our GHG emissions, but also a means  

of enhancing our operations and reducing energy costs. We therefore work to identify and implement ef-

ciency measures across our global operations. Highlights of our progress in 2022 included: 

Data center efciency: With the growing role of technology in fnancial services, data centers are an  

important component of our operations. To help manage the energy footprint from our data centers, we  

are implementing a global strategic data center confguration designed to an optimum size to serve our  

overall portfolio, and we continue to enhance the efciency of individual data centers. Our strategy  

includes migrating to newer, more efcient hardware and software to increase utilization and sharing of  

physical infrastructure. This drives down the size and number of servers needed to process our business,  

which lowers power consumption. We are also expanding the collection of detailed, real-time performance  

data to inform how we design, build and operate data centers, this has allowed us to operate our data cen-

ters at warmer temperatures and save energy. In addition, we have implemented modern cooling technol-

ogy that increases our energy efciency. 

Electrifcation:  Another key energy and emissions reduction opportunity is electrifcation. Transitioning  

away from the use of natural gas and other fossil fuels not only reduces direct emissions and enables  

greater use of renewables but can also result in lower overall energy consumption—electric systems often  

convert a greater share of total energy into useful output than the systems they replace. To that end, we  

intend to design and build fully electrifed retail branches wherever possible. We are additionally working  

to make greater use of electric transportation—for example, in urban areas, we are selecting local courier  

vendors who can ofer electric vehicles or push bikes to deliver business-to-business packages, reducing

emissions and complying with emissions regulations. We are also continuing work to transition JPMorgan  

OUR 2022 OPERATIONAL FOOTPRINT 

Chase’s entire owned vehicle feet to electric by the end of 2025. 

In addition to the above eforts, we are exploring and committing capital to full electrifcation and other  

strategies to enhance energy efciency across our real estate portfolio. For more information, see Sustain-

able Buildings on page 22. 

JPMorgan Chase’s reported operational GHG emissions are driven by two primary activities: powering our buildings (e.g., electricity,  

heating and cooling) and business travel. Scope 1 GHG emissions include those from building operations and company-owned aircraft  

and vehicles. Scope 2 emissions, from purchased electricity, are the largest driver of our building-related emissions and overall oper-

ational GHG footprint. The majority of our Scope 3 business travel-related emissions are driven by commercially operated air travel  

but includes other activities such as rail, car rental and hotel stays. A small portion of our business travel emissions are Scope 1  

emissions from company-owned aircraft and vehicles. We expect to continue to evaluate additional categories of operational emis-

sions for future reporting. 

For more information, see the detailed environmental data tables posted on our website.

SOURCING RENEWABLES 

EXPANDING ON-SITE SOLAR 

We are working to scale our use of renewable energy from both on-site installations  

and long-term energy procurement contracts to further reduce our operational  

emissions. Our goal is to increase the proportion of our global power needs being  

met by these solutions to at least 70% by the end of 2025, to help maximize the  

positive impact of our energy procurement strategy. 

On-site solar: We continue to expand on-site solar power at our corporate ofce  

buildings and retail branches across the U.S. In 2022, we executed contracts for  

on-site solar at fve of our commercial campuses and approved planning for addi-

tional solar capacity at another fve locations. We aim to complete construction at  

all ten locations by the end of 2025, which would bring the total size of our commer-

cial solar program to over 90 MW. Within our retail portfolio, we have made on-site  

solar a standard feature of our branches, where local regulations and circumstances  

allow. As of December 31, 2022, we had added solar installations at more than 400  

branches in nine states including Arizona, California, Ohio and New Jersey, for a  

total capacity of 15.7 MW. With additional installations currently in the planning  

stages, our goal is to increase total solar capacity at our retail locations to over 25

Long-term energy contracts: By securing additional renewable energy through

own energy needs but to steer capital toward projects that beneft the communities  

and regions where we operate. In 2022, our eforts included expanding our use of  

long-term contracts across our global operational footprint. We now have renewable

Our carbon credit portfolio is made up of credits from both nature-based and engineered removal proj-

ects, including improved forest management, grassland restoration, blue carbon and biochar. By support-

ing diferent kinds of carbon removal projects, we can help develop the broader market and scale emerg-

ing solutions. As we move forward, we aim to progressively shift our focus from shorter-durability, nature-

based carbon credits toward long-term or permanent carbon removal, refecting our desire to address our  

residual emissions with what we view as the highest-quality carbon credits available. 

IMPLEMENTING AN INTERNAL PRICE ON CARBON 

To support internal transparency and accountability, and accelerate progress toward our operational  

sustainability targets, we began the process of implementing the Climate Impact Contribution (“CIC”),  

which puts a price on the operational GHG emissions generated by our business activities, creating a  

pool of funds dedicated to support initiatives necessary to achieve our operational sustainability tar-

gets. This mechanism is designed to allow leadership to gain greater visibility of the emissions associ-

ated with their organization’s activities as well as their fnancial contribution toward sustainability ini-

tiatives. We plan to continue to evaluate the CIC and gather insights from its implementation.  

For example, in 2022, we purchased carbon credits from the Indus Delta Blue Carbon Project, a blue carbon project on the  

south-east coast of Pakistan. This project is one of the largest mangrove forest restoration eforts in the world, and the frst  

phase is expected to restore and protect approximately 555,000 acres of mangroves, which are among the world’s most diverse  

and vulnerable ecosystems. Coastal wetlands, dominated by mangroves and saltmarsh plants, are efective carbon sinks that  

also deliver numerous other environmental and community benefts. The project area provides important habitats to coastal fsh  

and several globally endangered or threatened species, including the rare Indus river dolphins, the Indian pangolin and the fsh-

ing cat. These coastal wetlands also serve as a refuge for many migratory shorebirds, supporting wildlife conservation. 

The project is also expected to provide enhanced ecosystem services and economic opportunities to nearby communities. The  

dense vegetation and coastal fringe location of the project area act as a protective barrier, mitigating potential damage from  

natural disturbances such as hurricanes and tsunamis. Proceeds from carbon sales and project activities are expected to be  

directed to help provide access to safe and clean water, and help support sustainable job opportunities as people are hired to  

restore wetlands, plant trees and revegetate the area. 

10   Carbon credits and the market for them are evolving rapidly. Although we endeavor to source high-quality carbon credits verifed by independent third parties, the ability to use carbon credits to fully and permanently "ofset" emissions or achieve carbon "neutrality" relies on certain assumptions and is subject to debate among experts. 

21 

 
Sustainable Buildings 

As a fnancial services company, the bulk of our reported operational environmental impact stems from how we  

design, build and operate our buildings. We therefore seek to take a holistic approach to enhancing the sustainability  

of our real estate portfolio, with a particular focus on increasing energy and resource efciency; reducing emissions;  

and creating healthy, productive spaces for our customers, clients and employees. Our priority initiatives currently 

include the following: 

Artifcial Intelligence building management: In an efort to increase the efciency of our ofce buildings, through the  

end of 2022, we installed a smart building management software at over 5 million square feet of our real estate port-

folio. The software is designed to analyze historical and real-time data from occupancy monitoring devices, indoor air  

quality sensors, building electricity meters and distributed energy resources, and utilizes artifcial intelligence to opti-

mize heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in real-time. This seeks to use the least amount of energy while  

maximizing thermal comfort and indoor air quality for occupants. 

New branch lighting plan: In 2022, we completed development of a new lighting standard that is intended to reduce  

lighting-related power consumption for future retail branches by nearly 30% and, in turn, Scope 2 GHG emissions as  

well as lifetime energy costs. 

Net-zero branch pilots: In 2022, we opened a Chase retail branch in Pico Rivera, California, that is piloting a net-zero

building techniques including a wood frame modular design, low-carbon concrete, enhanced insulation, rooftop solar  

arrays, full electrifcation and reclaimed asphalt in the parking lots. The material choices for the pilot project reduced  

embodied carbon by more than 10% when measured against our typical national branch design. Carbon credits will be  

procured to address any emissions associated with the embodied carbon of the building that cannot be mitigated  

through sustainable design. The branch is now undergoing an intensive energy performance analysis to meet third-

party standards for low-carbon design, while also providing insights to inform the design of future branches. In 2022,  

we also launched pilots for fve additional net-zero branches. Our intention is to leverage lessons from these pilots in

order to apply sustainable design principles to future branches. 

Sustainable materials: As part of the above eforts, we continue to seek opportunities to deploy sustainable and  

low-carbon construction materials, including carbon negative carpeting, eco-insulation, FSC-certifed wood, and low-

er-carbon concrete made with a 100% recycled post-consumer glass that can replace up to 50% of cement in con-

crete, creating a more durable, longer-lasting, and lower-carbon concrete. The frm has incorporated this lower-carbon  

concrete into all of the foor slabs in our new headquarters building and is considering additional applications.

waste disposal and therefore decreases contamination rates, and helps lower costs  

of individual waste bin liners and custodial services. We have deployed over 5,000  

centralized waste bins globally in ofce kitchens and cafes, communal desk areas,  

and loading docks. We are also piloting AI-powered cameras and sensors to monitor  

waste once it reaches the dumpster. This technology has the ability to detect dump-

ster fullness, improving collection efciency, and levels of waste stream contamina-

tion. In addition to in-ofce waste, we are also focused on reducing waste from the  

construction and renovation of our buildings, requiring a minimum of 75% of proj-

ect waste be diverted from landflls, where local supply chains allow.  

Improving lifecycle management of technology assets:  We expanded our Portfolio  

Lifecycle Management program to provide cradle-to-grave optimization of our tech-

nology assets. The program targets reduction of electronic waste (“e-waste”), efec-

tive asset recovery and redeployment, and proactive decommissioning of unneeded  

or unclaimed assets. As a result of these eforts, the Firm has prolonged the useful  

life of equipment and achieved millions of dollars in cost-avoidance. The program  

also helped identify and decommission hundreds of unnecessary servers and other  

devices in our branches, reducing power consumption. To further our target of  

diverting 100% of e-waste from landflls, we select vendors to dispose of our  

e-waste responsibly. In 2022 alone, our e-waste program diverted over 650 metric  

tons of solid waste, avoiding nearly 1,800 mtCO2e of GHG emissions.

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 

Our Firm understands and appreciates the unique role that Minority Depository Insti-

tutions (“MDIs”) and Community Development Financial Institutions (“CDFIs”) play in  

our communities. Our support of these essential institutions helps them to maximize  

their impact and serve communities that have historically been underserved. Over  

the last two years, the Firm has invested more than $100 million of equity in diverse-

owned and -led MDIs and CDFIs. Each MDI and CDFI is onboarded as a client and con-

customers purchasing a home in over 11,000 majority Black and Hispanic/Latino  

communities. We also expanded the Community Lending Program incentive14 to  

regional mortgage lenders that originate in Black and Hispanic/Latino communities  

across all Chase markets. 

As we support small businesses in majority Black, Hispanic and Latino communities,  

we continue to review how the Firm evaluates credit applications, with the goal of  

expanding access to credit and introducing new product oferings. In 2022, we

launched a SPCP for small businesses in historically underserved areas. By the end  

of the year, we hired more than 40 local Senior Business Consultants who provide  

one-on-one coaching and host educational events, community workshops, and busi-

ness training seminars to support minority entrepreneurs across 21 U.S. cities.  

We believe that diversifying our ecosystem of suppliers is good for our stakehold-

ers—including the businesses we work with, the communities in which they live and  

serve, and for our own frm. As part of our commitment, we are dedicated to the  

development and utilization of qualifed Black, Hispanic, and Latino businesses.  

JPMorgan Chase has established a frst-of-its-kind supplier grant program to help  

qualifed Black, Hispanic and Latino-owned businesses access key compliance mea-

sures that may be cost-prohibitive like cybersecurity, insurance bonding and other  

infrastructure costs. For more information on how the Firm is supporting its diverse

In 2022, to reinforce the Firm’s commitment to transparency, JPMorgan Chase retained an independent accountant to perform

With guidance from his JPMorgan Chase Community Home Lending Advisor, the buyer learned he qualifed for two  

grants, a $15,000 grant from Neighborhood LIFT and the $5,000 homebuying grant, for purchasing in an under-

served community. With these grants, the homebuyer closed on the unit in December 2022, becoming the frst  

homeowner in his family. The Firm is leaning on its resources—its presence in branches, its community-focused  

workforce, its grants, and more—to expand access to afordable homeownership and help reduce the homeowner-

ship gap for Black, Hispanic and Latino households.

JPMorgan Chase provides a range of development and collaboration opportunities for qualifed diverse businesses

Directors provided oversight of the attestation engagement. The attestation examination was performed in accordance with the  

standards established by the American Institute of Certifed Public Accountants. Their report includes an unqualifed opinion that  

management’s assertion regarding progress in disbursed and/or committed dollars and progress in units toward the Firm’s  

Racial Equity Commitment is fairly stated, in all material respects; please see the 2022 Racial Equity Commitment Audit Report. 

The preparation for and completion of the independent third-party attestation examination has been a valuable process that will

Our Journey and The Road Ahead 

The Firm’s commitment to community revitalization and underserved and low-income households did not begin with  

the Racial Equity Commitment. Rather, the Racial Equity Commitment was born out of years of leveraging our resources  

to uplift customers and communities. 

These experiences include our eforts in Detroit following its bankruptcy, the implementation of our AdvancingCities  

program across the globe, and the formation of our PolicyCenter to develop evidence-based policy solutions to expand  

inclusive economic opportunity. Our history of advancing equity has positioned our Firm to execute the complex,  

multi-faceted $30 billion commitment. 

INTRODUCTION 

As our Firm progresses in its commitment, we have realized that this journey is ongoing and will not be limited to fve

racial equity. Our commitment to closing the racial wealth gap will remain, no matter what headwinds and economic  

years. Rather, our work over the past two years has served as a catalyst to realize even more opportunities to advance  

uncertainties we face.

We continue to see innovations born out of the Racial Equity Commitment. As announced in February 2021, our Empow-

institutional money market funds through the creation of the Empower share class. This approach provides these insti-

tutions with a recurring revenue opportunity and amplifes their ability to deliver ongoing positive change in their com-

munities. At the same time, corporate investors can support the socioeconomic goals of minority- and diverse-led  

fnancial institutions. It is an innovation that helps support DEI goals of corporate investors and lifts those who have

APPENDICES 

In two years, our Firm has nearly met its initial $30 billion commitment toward advancing racial equity. Yet, we are  

aware of the work that remains, both in meeting each of our individual commitments, and for our country as a whole.  

For this reason, we are committed to continuing this work and measuring its outcomes to help advance lasting racial  

equity and make meaningful contributions to closing the racial wealth gap. By providing fnancial tools, products, and  

services, the Firm aims to help close the racial wealth gap, consistent with our belief that our business is stronger when  

our economy is more inclusive.

CASE STUDY PROVIDING A SECOND CHANCE 

The U.S. has more job openings than applicants, yet some qualifed candidates face obstacles to  

securing a good job: people with criminal records. Approximately one in three working-age adults  

in the U.S. has a criminal record19, and as a result, face economic barriers including hiring dis-

crimination and lost job opportunities. JPMorgan Chase is giving people with criminal records a  

second chance by supporting their participation in the workforce, communities and local econo-

mies. We have made changes in our own hiring and recruitment practices, along with advancing a  

policy agenda that reduces barriers to employment for people with criminal backgrounds.   

In 2022, the Firm expanded our Second Chance community-based hiring models in Detroit and  

Phoenix, with plans to continue expanding it to additional cities. These hiring models help reach  

qualifed candidates, many with criminal records, who previously may not have considered the  

Firm as a potential employer. Through the Second Chance Business Coalition, we continue to work  

with more than 45 cross-industry large-scale companies to expand second chance hiring and  

advancement, including developing best practices and tools for employers. In 2022, 10% of new  

JPMorgan Chase hires in the U.S. were people with criminal backgrounds. 

Additionally, together with JPMorgan Chase’s Legal Pro Bono team, community-based legal ser-

vices nonproft organizations and law frm pro bono partners, we hosted expungement clinics in  

Chicago, Columbus, and Wilmington with the aim of helping eligible individuals prepare the docu-

ments needed for the criminal record expungement or sealing process. Very few individuals who  

are eligible to have their records sealed or expunged ever apply because the petition-based sys-

tem is costly, complex and time-consuming.  

The Firm has supported updating industry hiring rules set in Section 19 of the Federal Deposit  

Insurance Act. In 2022, the Fair Hiring in Banking Act was signed into law, creating opportunities  

for more people with records that ft within the Section 19 industry guidelines to join our work-

force, as well as other fnancial frms. 

The Firm also supports Clean Slate legislation to automate the process of clearing or sealing eligi-

ble criminal records and open access to jobs in places such as Michigan, Delaware, Connecticut,  

Virginia, and most recently Colorado—and continues to support eforts to advance measures in  

New York, Illinois, Texas, Missouri, and Oregon.

GLOBAL CAREER READINESS 
COMMITMENT IN FRANCE 

In France, approximately 16% of young people ages 18 to 24  

are not in employment20 , education or training, suggesting  

that they will need alternative pathways to obtain the skills  

and experience necessary to succeed in the labor market.  

Across Île-de-France, there are more than 28,000 early school  

leavers21, with youth from disadvantaged backgrounds dispro-

portionately represented. School closures during the pan-

demic are estimated to have widened the educational attain-

ment gap and increased the risk of dropouts amongst poorer  

students, with unequal access to digital equipment, parental  

support, and/or suitable space to work. JPMorgan Chase is

Finding safe, afordable, and stable housing is one of the largest challenges fac-

JPMorgan Chase has taken a broad approach to support housing solutions that  

ft the Bay Area’s unique needs, with a focus on production, preservation, protec-

low-cost loan, with an initial $6 million committed in 2019 and an additional $6  

million committed in 2022, provided by the Firm’s Impact Finance and Advisory  

team to The San Francisco Housing Accelerator Fund (“HAF”). HAF is a nonproft  

CDFI established in 2017 to address key fnancing gaps and mitigate the housing  

afordability crisis in San Francisco and the wider Bay Area. HAF provides prede-

velopment, acquisition, and rehabilitation loans for small and large sites, includ-

ing single-room occupancy, residential hotel properties, and vacant or underuti-

lized land to be developed into afordable housing. As a lender to communi-

ty-based developers serving LMI populations, HAF has originated more than  

$350 million in fnancing across 38 projects, resulting in nearly 1,700 residential  

units and 30 commercial spaces being preserved or created, as of June 30, 2022. 

JPMorgan Chase is supporting the University of Miami’s Ofce of Civic and Com-

Investing in Employee Development 

Helping our employees advance their skills and professional development is important to our human capital strategy.  

We invest in our employees’ development through a robust suite of training, leadership development, upskilling and  

reskilling programs, mentorship initiatives, and performance evaluations. 

TRAINING 

We seek to train our employees with the skills needed for today and tomorrow. We prepared our new hire employees for 

their roles with approximately 34 hours of learning on average over their frst 90 days, and tenured employees take an 

average of approximately 10 hours of voluntary training annually. Employees consumed training in a variety of ways. Over 

60% of training was self-paced, and almost 35% was via virtual classroom. The remainder was facilitated in a traditional 

classroom setting. Overall, in 2022, employees completed over 9.7 million courses and over 7.9 million hours of training. 

Employees Firmwide are required to complete training on topics such as culture and conduct, anti-money laundering,  

privacy and data protection, cybersecurity and anti-corruption. They also have an opportunity to enhance their skills  

Leadership Day training, New York, New York is one example of how the Firm helps employees advance their skills and professional development. 

through training across a range of professional, business, digital and technology topics.

UPSKILLING AND RESKILLING 

Upskilling and reskilling our existing employees—who already know our culture and are committed to our company—is an  

efective and efcient way to have the talent we need to thrive now and into the future. Just as importantly, it is one of  

the best ways we can advance our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. For example, many of our Firm’s front-

line and entry-level employees, who largely identify as women and diverse, are most likely to be afected by technologi-

cal disruption. By taking proactive steps to create meaningful and accessible opportunities for career mobility, we can  

mitigate the risk of losing legacy talent, and continue our eforts toward a more diverse and representative workforce.  

To help employees understand the skills they need to advance their careers at the Firm, we ofer programs and training  

to help employees develop their own learning journey to support career growth and development. Approximately  

90,000 employees have leveraged the Firm’s internal Capabilities Model that provides learning recommendations for  

upskilling and reskilling. 

We further support employee development with enhanced education benefts, ofering funding for bachelors, masters  

and certifcation programs to eligible employees. In the U.S., we ofer a catalog of over 500 bachelors, masters, and  

certifcation programs, including 18 fully funded programs. The programs support employees in acquiring skills for the  

roles they are in today and prepare employees to take on new opportunities at the Firm. Of the more than 9,000  

employees who enrolled in our education benefts in 2022, 78% are associate level or below, 50% identify as women,  

62% identify as ethnically diverse and 48% of participants have experienced career mobility during 2022.  

Following the evacuation of Kabul in August 2021, hundreds of Afghans who had supported the U.K. and coalition Armed

ability mentoring. 27 employees have been paired with Afghan’s and have supported them in fnding opportunities in the 

U.K. employment market. One of the mentees joined the Firm’s Military Transition Program in February 2023. 

LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT 

Leadership Edge seeks to develop and inspire world-class managers and executives to drive a culture of inclusion, empowerment  

and growth, so employees can reach their full potential and deliver value for our Firm. In 2022, Leadership Edge launched a  

refreshed curriculum focused on eight manager capabilities which defne what it is to be a manager at the Firm. The capabilities  

include building teams; driving performance; prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion; and guiding careers. During the year,  

approximately 14,400 individual managers and executives participated in Leadership Edge initiatives, engaging through both  

instructor-led programs and digital, self-paced content. 

In 2022, we also continued to maintain a focus on our talent management and succession planning process. The human  

resources team actively engages with senior leaders to discuss key talent, internal succession and the development of our  

leadership pipeline.

key component. Since the program’s launch in 2018, we have had 100% retention of program participants and  

more than half of the participants have achieved promotion to Managing Director.  

PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS 

We use an annual Firmwide performance review process to help employees grow and to evaluate how they support our  

culture, business success, client/customer needs, and DEI initiatives. Employees are assessed on both results (“what”)  

and behaviors (“how”) on four Firmwide Performance Dimensions and expectations for their level: Business Results; Cli-

ent/Customer/ Stakeholder; Teamwork and Leadership; and Risks, Controls, and Conduct. 

Fostering Employee Engagement and Satisfaction 

Providing a frst-class employee experience is important to our human capital strategy. This includes engaging our  

employees in strengthening our culture and business, providing allyship for our diverse employee populations, and lis-

tening and responding to employee experiences and ideas.  

We also support employees’ drive to help strengthen their communities by facilitating skills-based volunteering oppor-

tunities. The Firm provides one day of paid time of for volunteer and employee engagement activities from Firm-spon-

sored events to outside activities that are meaningful to our employees. We also provide paid time of to vote in any

tively for the work they do. 

We continue to increase wages for our full- and part-time U.S. hourly paid employ-

ees. As of December 2022, we raised minimum base pay for U.S. overtime-eligible  

employees to between $20 and $25 per hour, depending on location. This is in addi-

tion to the benefts package the Firm ofers that is valued, on average, at approxi-

mately $16,000 per employee for this population. 

PAY EQUITY 

We are committed to fair compensation for our employees. We conduct periodic pay  

equity reviews that include employees at all levels within the Firm. In 2022, taking  

into account factors such as an employee's role, tenure, seniority and geography, in  

aggregate, those who self-identifed as women globally were paid 99% of what men  

were paid. In 2022, in the U.S., employees who self-identifed as other than White  

under EEO Commission classifcations were paid, as a group, 100% of what employ-

ees who self-identifed as White were paid—meaning there were no statistically sig-

nifcant diferences in pay as between the two groups, taking into account factors  

such as an employee’s role, tenure, seniority and geography. Pay equity reviews  

give us important insights, but they are just a starting point. If we identify individu-

als with compensation that is less than expected, we dig deeper. Where appropriate,

Supporting Employees and Their 
Families Across Life Stages 

At JPMorgan Chase, we support our people and provide them with c  omprehensive  

health care programs and well-being benefts. That is why we are continually  

investing in and exploring ways to improve health outcomes and strengthen our  

beneft oferings. JPMorgan Chase ofers an extensive benefts and wellness pack-

age to employees and their families, including healthcare coverage, retirement  

benefts, life and disability insurance, onsite health and wellness centers,  

employee assistance programs, competitive vacation and leave policies, backup 

child care arrangements, tuition reimbursement programs, counseling and  

resources related to mental health, and fnancial coaching. We direct a greater  

portion of our benefts spend toward lower-wage earners in the form of lower  

payroll contributions and lower deductibles in the Medical Plan and a $750 special  

award in 2022 to employees earning less than $60,000. In addition, we continue  

HEALTH PROGRAMS 

We ofer health care benefts for employees and their families. In 2022, we covered  

approximately $1.4 billion in medical costs for employees and their families.  

We also encourage our employees to focus on their well-being and make healthy  

choices a priority. For example, we ofer biometric wellness screening and online  

wellness assessments for employees and their covered spouses/domestic partners.  

In 2022, approximately 70% of enrolled employees and over 60% of enrolled  

spouses/domestic partners completed both of these assessments. Additionally,  we  

have onsite Health and Wellness Centers in 24 U.S. locations and 34 onsite health  

clinics across our other global locations. 

We are also focused on supporting our employees’ mental health. We are building a

JPMorgan Chase believes that responsible corporate citizenship demands a strong commitment to a healthy and  

informed democracy through civic and community involvement. Our business is subject to extensive laws and regula-

tions, and changes to such laws can signifcantly afect how we operate, our revenues and the costs we incur. Because  

of the impact public policy can have on our businesses, employees, communities and customers, we engage with poli-

cymakers holding a range of views on a range of issues—including banking, fnancial services, cybersecurity, workforce  

development, small business, tax, trade and inclusive economic growth, among others—to advance and protect the  

long-term interests of the Firm.  

The Firm’s political engagement and public policy activities are managed by Global Government Relations. This organi-

zation and leadership helps us focus the Firm’s political engagement eforts on those public policy issues most relevant  

to the long-term interests of the Firm overall and to our clients and shareholders. 

The Firm belongs to a number of trade associations and ESG-related initiatives that advocate on and help address  

major public policy issues of importance to the Firm and the communities we serve. The Firm’s participation as a mem-

We are also committed to participating in international eforts to combat money

implemented a risk-based, global Anti-Money Laundering Compliance & Sanctions

regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate. We are also part of

derives from public assistance programs or to the fact that the applicant has in  

good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The expec-

tation around fair treatment of our current and potential customers extends to  

every aspect of a credit transaction, including not only how we review credit  

requests, but also our advertising, handling of pre-application inquiries, loan dis-

bursements, and ongoing servicing of the loan. 

Responsible Marketing 

We believe it is important to be clear and transparent in our advertising and market-

ing. The Firm seeks to comply with applicable laws and regulations on responsible  

and fair marketing practices. Our sales employees are expected to communicate with  

customers in a clear, truthful and complete manner and to provide them with rele-

vant information to make an informed decision. Our lines of business are required to  

have an established procedure for reviewing all new and revised marketing materi-

als, terms and conditions, disclaimers and other customer communications. 

Our suppliers respond to annual targeted surveys through which we assess how well  

they manage issues such as labor practices, human rights, environmental manage-

ment, and occupational health and safety. We believe that the efective manage-

ment of these issues, including adherence to applicable laws and regulations,  

reduces potential risk to both JPMorgan Chase and our suppliers. In 2022, we  

enhanced our supplier DEI standards and clarifed requirements for suppliers. The  

DEI practices of our suppliers are assessed and monitored.  

We have set up a Supply Network collective comprised of supplier-management  

stakeholders across the Firm, including vendor management, sourcing and procure-

ment, and fnance and business management, which aims to promote community,  

connectivity and collaboration as ways to improve JPMorgan Chase's supply chain.  

The Firm leverages its relationships with its key suppliers to promote increased spend-

ing with underrepresented businesses and provides them with guidance in building 

their own supplier diversity programs; 85% of the suppliers enrolled in the Firm’s sup-

plier diversity mentorship program launched new supplier diversity programs in 2022.

Note: JPMorgan Chase supports employee rights and 
seeks to adhere to local laws regarding the freedom of 
association and collective employee action. We also have 
relationships with trade unions and work councils in the 
regions where we operate as well as through many of our 
vendors. Most JPMorgan Chase employees are not covered 
by collective bargaining agreements and no U.S.- based 
employees are subject to collective bargaining agree-
ments. JPMorgan Chase’s Code of Conduct sets forth the 
Firm’s expectations for each employee. The Code of Con-
duct provides the principles that govern employee conduct 
with clients, customers, shareholders and one another, as 
well as with the markets and communities in which JPMor-
gan Chase does business. Employees are encouraged to 
raise any concerns through multiple channels identifed in 
the Code of Conduct.

Note on the Firm’s legal proceedings: As of December 31, 
2022, the Firm and its subsidiaries and afliates are defen-
dants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, 
including private, civil litigations, government investiga-
tions or regulatory enforcement matters. The litigations 
range from individual actions involving a single plaintif to 
class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class mem-
bers. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters 
involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both 
governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations.  
These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudica-
tion, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the 
Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a 
wide variety of claims (including common law tort and con-
tract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and con-
sumer protection claims), some of which present novel 
legal theories. For further discussion, please refer to 
JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s publicly fled disclosures, including 
its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly 
Reports on Form 10-Q fled with the U.S. Securities and

Note on the Firm’s legal proceedings: JPMorgan Chase & Co. and/or its sub-
sidiaries (collectively, the "frm") are defendants or putative defendants in 
numerous legal proceedings, including private civil litigations and regulatory/ 
government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions 
involving a single plaintif to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of 
class members and cover a wide range of issues. Investigations involve both 
formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and 
self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages 
of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the frm's 
lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including com-
mon law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and con-
sumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. Based 
on current knowledge, the frm believes it has asserted meritorious defenses 
to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceed-
ings, intends to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. For further discus-
sion, please refer to JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s publicly fled disclosures, includ-

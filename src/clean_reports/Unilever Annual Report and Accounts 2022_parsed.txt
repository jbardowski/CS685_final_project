Unilever's Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP), which is available on our website, outlines our climate targets and the actions we will take to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our business and value chain as we seek to make progress towards them.

It sets out our progress against strategic programmes to deliver net zero, outlines how we are using our influence for change, and provides an analysis of our GHG emissions.

It also provides an update on our approach to climate governance, disclosure and emissions measurement, and demonstrates how closely linked our climate actions are to delivering our nature goals.

For more information on our goals to protect and regenerate nature, please see page 32.

The complex nature of our business, operating across many categories, product formats and geographies, means that our pathway to net zero will consist of a significant number of initiatives which tackle our biggest emissions sources.

The work we have undertaken in 2022 has helped us to clarify and prioritise these initiatives within each of our five Business Groups.

Our focus will now be on scaling these initiatives over the short to medium term to deliver annual absolute GHG emission reductions.

In 2022, we made good progress against our targets.

We reduced the Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from our operations by 13% versus 2021 (68% against a 2015 baseline).

Our full value chain Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions, on a per consumer use basis, reduced by 5% versus 2021 (19% against a 2010 baseline), which is another important step towards halving the emissions of our products per consumer use by 2030.

When we focus in on our Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions in scope of our net zero target ('our GHG emissions'), which excludes emissions from indirect consumer use, we see that whilst there was a reduction in product volumes in the measured period, our GHG emissions increased by 2%.

The progress we have made in reducing GHG emissions from our operations, packaging, logistics, and our retail emissions, was offset by an increase in emissions from raw materials and ingredients and an increase in direct consumer use emissions.

A table detailing our progress against our climate metrics and targets and an analysis of GHG emissions over the last three years can be found in our climate metrics and targets section on pages 38 to 41.

The graphic above provides a breakdown of our GHG emissions.

Emissions from our raw materials and ingredients represent 59% of our GHG emissions.

These emissions increased by 4% from 2021 driven by changes in sales mix within our Nutrition and Ice Cream Business Groups and changes in the reported emissions of various raw materials, as a result of now having improved emissions data.

The improvements that we have made to our data include the use of supplier data, rather than industry averages, for the production of soda ash (used in many of our Home Care products), and the use of more accurate data for the specific types of chocolate and soy we use in our Nutrition and Ice Cream businesses.

Since emissions associated with raw materials are outside our direct control, we collaborate closely with our suppliers.

In 2021, we announced the Unilever Supplier Climate Programme, which aims to accelerate the decarbonisation of our shared supply chains across raw materials and ingredients and packaging materials.

For more details on packaging materials see pages 32 to 33.

We are targeting 300 priority suppliers for this programme and during 2022, we ran a pilot with 35 raw material suppliers of varying sizes and climate maturities, covering a range of industries and geographies.

Suppliers participating in the pilot were able to build their climate knowledge and develop expert capabilities to calculate and share their GHG emissions data.

The feedback from this pilot is informing the roll out and scale up of this important programme in 2023.

While our business relies on chemicals derived from fossil fuels, we can reduce our emissions by transitioning towards ingredients which use renewable or recycled carbon.

Our Home Care Business Group’s Clean Future strategy is at the forefront of this pioneering approach, identifying opportunities to replace fossil fuel based ingredients with renewable and recyclable alternatives.

Alternative ingredients are critical to our plans to achieve net zero and will help us future proof our portfolio by diversifying our supply chains while offering consumers more sustainable, lower emission products.

This year we launched a 115 million ( 120 million) joint venture with Genomatica, a US based biotech company, to commercialise and scale low carbon plant based feedstock ingredients.

We expect these alternative ingredients to deliver GHG emission reductions in the medium to long term.

In 2022, we reached 667 million people through our brand purpose health and wellbeing programmes.

See Personal Care on page 17 and Beauty Wellbeing on page 14 for more.

Equity, diversity and inclusion providing targeted training and financial support to our value chain partners.

For example, in Pakistan we are working with a financial services platform to digitise payments between retailers and distributors.

This gives retailers a secure and convenient way to pay our distributors, as well as access to credit so they can extend their range of Unilever products in store.

We are taking a number of actions to future proof our business and our people against changes in the world of work.

On top of the critical work we are doing in our business to advance equity, diversity and inclusion (see page 28), we are also taking action in our advertising and with our suppliers.

We aim to advance and promote respect for human rights in everything we do.

In pursuit of this, we continue to implement action plans relating to our salient human rights issues.

For example, we are using digital tools to assess social risks in our supply chain, including land rights and forced labour starting with palm oil.

We launched a Gender Equity Framework designed to address gender discrimination in agriculture, manufacturing and women led last mile distribution networks.

We also continue to make progress on the elimination of recruitment fees paid by workers in our supply chain, by actively monitoring remediation of identified cases.

We also became a founding member of the Fair Circularity Initiative to encourage the adoption of principles on respecting the rights of waste collectors in the recycling industry’s informal sector, such as those that exist in India and Indonesia.

We expect our suppliers to conduct business with high standards of integrity, human rights and environmental sustainability.

The new policy has a broader scope and includes guidance on reducing GHG emissions, minimising waste, safeguarding nature and protecting personal data.

As one of the world’s largest advertisers by spend, we have a responsibility to ensure our advertisements represent the communities we serve.

We are working to increase the representation of diverse groups in our advertising through our Act 2 Unstereotype programme.

This looks at our end to end marketing process to give opportunities to under represented and under served communities, both on screen and behind the camera.

While there is still more work to do, we are encouraged by analysis from Kantar which found that we are industry leading on our progressive approach to representation in advertising.

Kantar also found that our most progressive advertising has the potential to deliver almost double the branded impact than the least progressive.

We have committed to spend 2 billion annually with diverse businesses worldwide by 2025.

These are businesses which are owned, managed and controlled by members of under represented or minority groups in the country in which they operate.

Through the programme, we are supporting our diverse suppliers to access skills, mentoring and finance.

For example, in Kenya we are partnering with Citibank to offer access to preferential financing for suppliers which are owned by women.

We are working to raise living standards throughout our value chain.

A key pillar of our approach is our work to ensure that everyone who directly provides goods and services to Unilever earns at least a living wage or income by 2030.

This year, our focus has been on the collaborative manufacturing partners who are dedicated solely to Unilever production.

Some of our partners have already confirmed that workers at collaborative manufacturing sites are being paid a living wage.

We have made good progress in laying the foundations to ensure that suppliers who provide core services to Unilever also pay a living wage.

Through a comprehensive advocacy programme, we are asking for widespread adoption of living wage commitments by all stakeholders, companies, governments, NGOs and investors, and have started various studies to demonstrate impact on workers and companies, for example with Oxfam in India.

Supporting the small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in our value chain is another part of our approach to raising living standards.

Our goal is to help 5 million SMEs grow their businesses by 2025.

At the end of 2022, 1.8 million small retailer stores used our digital platforms, enabling them to purchase our products and in turn grow their business.

Forests play a key role in removing carbon from the atmosphere.

We are working towards achieving our goal of a deforestation free supply chain for palm oil, paper and board, tea, soy and cocoa by the end of 2023.

This requires close collaboration with a complex array of suppliers from smallholder farmers to multinational companies.

We are working towards this by investing in the transformation of our manufacturing infrastructure.

In 2022, we began the upgrade of our Unilever Oleochemicals facility in North Sumatra, with a spend of 59 million ( 63 million).

The aim of this project is to simplify our supply chain and allow us to process oil from independent mills and smallholder farmers.

Read more about our progress to achieving our deforestation free target on page 32.

Our regenerative agriculture programme plays an important role in transforming our value chain to enable us to achieve our net zero goals.

In 2022, supported by our Climate Nature Fund, our Knorr brand has established pilot projects to reduce the environmental impact of the ingredients used in its products.

Knorr will launch 50 projects in collaboration with farmers to lower and sequester GHG emissions and reduce water consumption, while improving biodiversity, soil health and livelihoods.

These form part of our overall regenerative agriculture programme.

Read more about regenerative agriculture on page 32.

Our Climate Nature Fund is a commitment to invest 1 billion by 2030 in climate, nature and waste projects.

It aims to connect value chain transformation with our brands and will help us to take targeted action to address climate change, protect nature and grow responsibly, ultimately helping us achieve our net zero ambition.

By the end of 2022, we had spent and committed over 200 million.

Dairy products are a priority raw material used by our Ice Cream brands such as Wall’s, Magnum and Ben Jerry’s.

Cows emit large amounts of methane one of the most potent greenhouse gases.

Lowering GHG emissions from dairy products is therefore essential for the delivery of our net zero goal.

As well as exploring the use of regenerative farming practices to reduce the GHG emissions of our dairy value chain, we are evaluating new technologies to reduce dairy emissions at source.

In 2022, in the US and Europe, we launched a pilot through our Ben Jerry’s brand to work with 15 dairy farms with the aim of reducing emissions by up to half by 2024.

Emissions associated with our packaging materials make up 13% of our GHG emissions.

In 2022, our emissions from packaging reduced by 1% versus 2021, driven by a reduction in the use of virgin plastic which is made from a derivative of crude oil and natural gas.

Read more about plastic packaging on pages 32 to 33.

Despite the GHG emissions from our operations being relatively small at 2%, they are where we have the greatest influence.

We are working to achieve a 100% reduction in our operational Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from our factories, offices, research laboratories and warehouses by 2030, against a 2015 baseline.

In 2022, we reduced our operational GHG emissions by 13%.

This means that in total we have reduced our operational GHG emissions by 68% versus 2015, putting us on track to achieve our interim target of a 70% reduction by 2025.

We are making progress by converting to renewable electricity and energy while, at the same time, improving our energy efficiency.

In 2022, 93% of our electricity was from renewable sources, an increase of almost 7% since 2021.

We report in line with RE100’s best practice on renewable electricity reporting, which means that we only report electricity as 'renewable' when the accompanying Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), originate in the same market in which we are operating.

We also include renewable electricity generated at our factories, such as the electricity from our combined heat and power plants (CHPs) and on site solar installations.

Decarbonisation of the energy we use to generate heat is critical in the next phase of our strategy to achieve our 2030 operational emissions goal, including 100% renewable thermal energy.

In 2022, over a third of our thermal energy came from renewable sources.

Our factories also achieved a full year of production without direct coal use in our operations.

In June 2022, we responded to the growing external debate on the sustainability of biogenic fuel sources with the publication of the Unilever position on the sustainable sourcing of biofuels.

We are focused on improving energy efficiency and in 2022, our factories reduced their operational energy consumption by 4%, versus 2021.

In 2022, we invested 37 million in capital expenditure projects via our Clean Technology Fund.

These projects were mainly focused on renewable energy and resource efficiency, and we estimate that they will result in an 88,000 tonne reduction in GHG emissions across their lifecycles.

We also use an internal carbon price of 70 per tonne of CO2 to inform our investment decision making.

Another part of our climate transition strategy is to introduce more plant based options into our Ice Cream and Nutrition portfolios, increasing sales of dairy alternatives and meat replacement products.

In 2022, Unilever Nutrition and Ice Cream achieved 1.2 billion in sales from plant based products.

In our Ice Cream business, our non dairy, plant based portfolio represents 8% of the Business Group's turnover.

In 2022, we launched new vegan products, including Magnum Vegan Mini Classics.

Tackling food waste helps to mitigate climate change, address food insecurity, protect natural resources and deliver economic benefits.

That is why we are aiming to halve food waste in our operations by 2025 (measured in tonnes rather than CO2e).

In 2022, our company wide food waste warrior programmes resulted in good progress against this goal, and reduced food waste per tonne of food handled in our operations by 17%, versus a 2019 baseline.

Forests play a key role in removing carbon from the atmosphere.

Downstream logistics and distribution make up 3% of our GHG emissions.

Emissions from upstream logistics and distribution are included in the raw material and ingredients category.

In 2022, we reduced our total logistics emissions by 7% versus 2020.

One of the ways we have achieved this is by reducing the number of kilometres travelled, by 11% versus 2020.

We are also piloting new alternative fuels and zero emission technologies in collaboration with our logistics partners.

For example, in the Netherlands, we have been trialling zero emission refrigeration technology for transporting our ice cream products which uses electricity instead of diesel.

We strongly support the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and have committed to 100% EVs or hybrids in our global car fleet by 2030.

EVs and hybrids currently make up over 8% of our fleet.

In 2022, we conducted a pilot in Italy and Denmark to understand the carbon emissions of our customer development operations and identify the areas of greatest impact to inform our actions in 2023 and beyond.

Ice cream freezers in retail stores make up 10% of our GHG emissions.

Retail emissions decreased by 5% from 2021, primarily as a result of the wider industry energy grid decarbonisation and our continued transition to lower impact point of sale cabinets.

This year, we continued the progress made in 2021 and all new freezers we purchased used lower carbon, natural hydrocarbon refrigerants.

We estimate that over 95% of our 3 million freezers now use these refrigerants.

We also continue to invest in energy efficient freezers, with the average energy use per unit falling by 2.5% compared to 2021.

In 2022, we completed a market trial in Germany of warming up’ freezers from 18 C to 12 C, to reduce energy consumption.

The result of this trial was positive: with suitable product formulations, we can achieve an energy saving of up to 30% while not compromising on ice cream quality.

Propellants are used in aerosol products: hair sprays, body sprays and deodorant sprays.

In the US, Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) regulations restrict the use of the hydrocarbon propellants that we use elsewhere.

Instead, hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) propellants are used to reduce the VOC levels in aerosol products in the US.

HFC propellants typically have a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of around 120, meaning they are 120 times more potent than carbon dioxide in contributing to global warming.

As a result, HFC propellants in North America make up 2% of our GHG emissions.

In 2022, GHG emissions from direct consumer use of sold products increased by 15% from 2021.

This was driven by a post Covid bounce back in the sales of hair sprays, deodorant sprays and body sprays in the US.

Additionally, a change in the US regulation which requires a lowering of VOCs led to an increase in the HFCs used in the short term.

However, we believe this regulatory change will, in the future, enable innovation on alternative propellant systems to facilitate significantly lower GHG emissions from hair sprays, dry shampoos, deodorant sprays and body sprays.

We remain committed to leading the development of alternative, low GWP propellants and formats.

For example, in 2022 our natural Personal Care brand Schmidt’s launched an innovation which uses nitrogen propelled air spray in the US.

The disposal of waste products and packaging, including the biodegradation of product formulations after their use, makes up 11% of our GHG emissions.

Our goal is that 100% of our ingredients will be biodegradable by 2030.

We want consumers to be confident that the products they use will not leave a physical trace in the environment.

We are therefore focusing on product reformulation to replace the small percentage of our ingredients which do not meet our biodegradability standards.

We are also using new biodegradable ingredients such as coconut oil instead of silicone in our Hair Care portfolio.

We recognise that this goal creates a tension with our net zero target because when products biodegrade, they break down into their component parts, which could include CO2, producing additional emissions.

Therefore, we remain focused on increasing our use of renewable and recycled ingredients which will lower GHG emissions as our products biodegrade.

For more details, please see our update on renewable and recycled ingredients on page 35.

Around two thirds of our products' full value chain GHG emissions come from their use by consumers (indirect consumer use).

This includes, for instance, the energy used by washing machines and hot water used for showering.

There is a limit to how much we can influence emissions from product use as consumers make their own choices on how long they shower, which energy provider they use, and how efficient their home appliances are.

We are therefore reliant, as many companies are, on the decarbonisation of the energy grid to reduce our downstream indirect use emissions.

We are advocating for system wide change, such as the acceleration of renewable energy globally.

In 2022, we were awarded the RE100 Market Trailblazer award for our commitment to driving market change through our electricity procurement approach and our external policy advocacy.

In 2022, our indirect consumer use emissions fell by 11% from 2021.

This was driven by a number of factors, across many of our key markets: grid energy decarbonisation in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Turkey, sales mix changes and higher product volume growth in markets where cold washing and handwashing is predominant.

This reduction in indirect consumer use emissions was the primary driver of the 5% reduction in our full value chain GHG emissions per consumer use since 2021.

We use a number of key metrics and targets to assess and manage climate risks and opportunities across our full value chain.

Two of the targets have been recognised as science based by the Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi'): Reduce in absolute terms our operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 100% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline, with an interim goal to achieve a 70% reduction by 2025 against a 2015 baseline (medium term emissions target).

Halve the full value chain emissions (Scope 1 to 3) of our products on a per consumer use basis by 2030 against a 2010 baseline (medium term intensity target).

While our operational target is consistent with the 1.5 C ambition of the Paris Agreement, our full value chain target is consistent with a 2 C temperature increase.

This is because it was set in 2010 and validated by the Science Based Targets initiative before the 1.5 C validation was introduced.

We have a target to achieve net zero emissions by 2039.

We are currently completing a review of our 2030 full value chain target and intend to submit an updated target, along with our net zero target, to SBTi for validation in 2023.

We also have a number of nature, waste and nutrition related targets which play an important role in tackling climate change.

We are using our voice to advocate for systematic change that will help us, and others, achieve our climate goals in line with the Paris Agreement.

In 2022, our policy advocacy priorities included: Securing high ambition outcomes in emerging frameworks around net zero targets and climate transition plans.

Helping to shape the evolution of the voluntary carbon market in a way that supports additional financial flows to forest protection and nature regeneration, without removing the pressure on companies to reduce emissions.

Continuing to push for high ambition policy outcomes within international forums such as the COP27 climate summit and the G20.

This work was primarily conducted in partnership with other businesses through coalitions, and through direct engagement and advocacy with policymakers in a number of key markets.

Our CEO Alan Jope continued to support the UK COP26 Presidency as a member of the COP26 Business Leaders Group.

We also attended COP27, working in partnership with groups such as the We Mean Business Coalition, to call for higher ambition national climate plans, increased finance for climate mitigation and adaptation in vulnerable countries, and energy and food systems transformation, including the building of more resilient and sustainable food chains through regenerative agriculture.

We are conducting a global trade association review.

As part of this, we are assessing whether trade associations are aligned with the Paris Agreement, our climate policy position and sustainability commitments.

We disclose a list of our principal trade associations by region on our website.

In 2022, we also supported the launch, at COP27 Sharm El Sheikh, of the Corporate Knights Action Declaration on Climate Policy Engagement.

Full details of our climate governance are included in our TCFD reporting on page 42.

In 2022, we introduced new internal governance mechanisms to oversee progress against our climate goals.

These included the creation of a quarterly sustainability review undertaken by the Unilever Leadership Executive where progress against climate and other sustainability targets is reviewed.

We believe that transparency on our GHG emissions and the progress we are making towards our targets is key to delivering our net zero goal.

In addition to the climate disclosures in our Annual Report and Accounts, we provide detailed information on our climate strategy and performance to CDP, the leading disclosure platform.

In 2022, we received a rating of A for both Climate and Forests and A for our Water disclosures based on our submissions of 2021 data.

Our CDP submissions are publicly available on our website.

We use a number of key metrics and targets to assess and that will help us, and others, achieve our climate goals in manage climate risks and opportunities across our full value line with the Paris Agreement.

The change in our logistics and distribution emissions between 2020 and 2021 is a result of a move from using industry standard global GHG emission conversion factors to industry standard regional GHG conversion factors in our calculations.

GHG emissions consist of our measured Scope 1 and 2 emissions plus an estimate of our Scope 3 emissions.

Scope 1 encompasses direct GHG emissions from energy generated from fossil fuels such as gas and oil, as well as emissions from refrigerants.

Scope 2 encompasses indirect GHG emissions from the on site generation and purchase of electricity according to the market based method’ and purchased thermal energy.

Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions come from energy and refrigerants used in our own operations, largely in our factories which produce most of our emissions.

Scope 3 GHG emissions are estimated by measuring the emissions of a representative sample of approximately 3,000 products across 12 categories and 14 countries through a detailed footprinting exercise.

For each representative product, internal and external data sources are used to represent various lifecycle activities and inputs (for example, specification of product, energy for site of manufacture and consumer use data).

The GHG emissions impact of ingredients and packaging are obtained from external databases (based on industry averages) or internal expert studies.

We then extrapolate the results at a country level across the unsampled products to obtain the estimated GHG emissions for each of the 14 countries.

These 14 countries account for 60 70% of our total sales volumes.

As set out in our CTAP, and in line with the SBTi’s approach, the GHG emissions included in the scope of our net zero target ('our GHG emissions') exclude the indirect consumer use emissions associated with our products.

We are on a continuous journey to update and improve the accuracy of our reported emissions by reducing the level of estimation and by replacing the use of industry averages with more specific supplier data.

These changes can affect both the emissions in a baseline year for our approved targets and the annual emissions we report.

Measuring Scope 3 emissions is challenging for most companies with measurement methodologies reliant on estimations and the use of industry average data.

Following a successful pilot earlier this year, through the Partnership for Carbon Transparency (PACT), hosted by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, we have now successfully exchanged emissions data with several partners.

This work demonstrates proof of concept for what we believe will be a significant shift in the way that Scope 3 emissions are standardised, measured and reported in the future.

Our 2030 full value chain GHG emissions target is expressed on a 'per consumer use' basis.

This means a single use, portion or serving of a product.

This target covers Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions across the full value chain including both direct and indirect consumer use emissions.

Consumer use is based on either consumer habits studies or on pack recommendations.

In cases where relevant consumer habits studies are unavailable, internal expert opinion is also used.

The following statement, which Unilever believes is consistent with the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures, details the risks and opportunities arising from climate change, the potential impact on our business and the actions we’re taking to respond.

We also integrate climate related disclosures throughout this Annual Report and Accounts, including in our Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) Annual Progress Report on pages 35 to 41.

A detailed breakdown of our emissions can be found on page 39.

The overall governance structure for managing Unilever’s climate risks and opportunities is the same as for any of Unilever’s other key risks and opportunities i.e.

Whilst the Board takes overall accountability for the management of all risks and opportunities, including climate change (see page 67), our CEO is ultimately responsible for oversight of our climate change agenda.

The Board delegates specific climate change matters to each of the Board subcommittees: The Corporate Responsibility Committee oversees the development of Unilever’s sustainability agenda (which includes climate matters), the progress against that agenda, including performance against specific targets, whilst also reviewing sustainability related risks, developments and opportunities (see page 107).

The Audit Committee oversees the non financial disclosures in our Annual Report and Accounts, which includes climate related disclosures.

This includes reviewing the scope and results of any internal and external assurance activities obtained over the disclosures (see page 102).

The Compensation Committee supports the sustainability strategy which includes the climate strategy through alignment of Unilever’s incentive plan to the sustainability agenda and ambitions (see page 112).

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for ensuring that the composition of the Board provides sufficient skills and experience in sustainability matters including climate change to deliver on the sustainability agenda (see page 98).

The Board is supported by ULE and the Sustainability Advisory Council.

The Council is made up of seven independent external specialists in social and environmental matters and meets twice a year to guide and critique our strategy.

The ULE discuss key strategic sustainability matters at least quarterly.

During 2022, climate change matters were discussed at each meeting including progress against our climate related Compass goals.

The specific topics discussed included our net zero roadmaps, changes in the SBTi guidelines and implications on our targets, and Climate Nature Fund progress and priorities.

Additional ULE subcommittees are also in place to support our climate agenda and ULE decision making, including: Business Operations Sustainability Steering Committee: Provides strategic guidance on implementation of our Climate, Nature and Social Compass commitments within our extended supply chain.

Chaired by our Chief Business Operations Officer, attended together with our Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), Chief Procurement Officer and Head of Sustainable Business and Reporting.

Climate and Nature Investment Committee: Evaluates and approves investment proposals, reviews progress against key milestones for the Climate Nature Fund, our 1 billion commitment to commercialising sustainability through disruptive transformations of our value chain.

Chaired by our Chief Business Operations Officer together with our CSO, Chief R D Officer, Head of Sustainable Business and Reporting and our five Business Group Presidents.

Each Business Group has a sustainability lead to ensure that sustainability risks and opportunities are embedded into their strategies and performance is monitored.

We also have a specialist Corporate team, the Global Sustainability Function, led by our CSO.

This team supports the Business Group teams in developing their business strategies whilst also driving transformational change across markets through advocacy and partnerships.

Our CSO also chairs the Unilever Next Gen Sustainability Council which is a collective of young advocates, who are independently connected to broader youth bodies.

The Council aims to capture the voice and expectations of young people across key sustainability issues.

In addition, included within the Supply Chain, R D and Finance corporate functions, we have teams of experts who are focused on the sustainability agenda which includes climate related matters.

Their activities include developing relevant policies and procedures e.g.

We regularly engage with our investors on a wide range of sustainability matters including our climate strategy.

In 2021, we achieved shareholder support for our CTAP through an advisory vote at our AGM.

We will continue to have an advisory vote on the CTAP every three years.

Remuneration for management employees up to and including the ULE continues to be formally linked to performance against climate change goals.

Their reward packages include fixed pay, a bonus as a percentage of fixed pay and eligibility to participate in a long term Performance Share Plan (PSP).

The PSP is linked to financial and sustainability performance, guided by our Sustainability Progress Index (SPI), which accounts for 25% of the total PSP award.

The SPI in 2022 is determined by considering performance against a number of sustainability targets see page 117 for details.

See pages 117 to 118 for more on PSP including the role of the Board’s Compensation Committee and Corporate Responsibility Committee in determining how the PSP operates, and the SPI outcome each year.

Climate change is a principal risk to Unilever which has the potential to varying degrees to impact our business in the short , medium and long term.

We face potential physical environment risks from the effects of climate change on our business, including extreme weather and water scarcity.

Potential regulatory and transition market risks associated with the shift to a low carbon economy include changing consumer preferences and future government policy and regulation.

The potential impacts of climate change are taken into account in developing the overall strategy, our Business Group strategies and financial plans.

More detail on these risks, opportunities and the mitigating actions we’re taking can be found on pages 44 to 51.

The process for assessing and identifying climate related risks is the same for each of the principal risks and is described on page 67.

The risks are reviewed and assessed on an ongoing basis and formally at least once per year.

For each of our principal risks we have a risk management framework detailing the controls we have in place, who is responsible for managing both the overall risk and the individual controls mitigating it.

We monitor risks throughout the year to identify changes in the risk profile.

We regularly, where appropriate, carry out climate related risk assessments at site level, supplier level, as well as innovation project level.

Climate related risks are managed by the team relevant to where the risk resides.

For example, climate risks in relation to commodities in the supply chain are managed by our procurement team.

We have conducted several high level scenario analyses on the potential impacts of climate change to help us consider and adapt our strategies and financial planning.

In prior years, we have reported the potential financial impacts of climate change on our business in 2030 if average global temperatures were to rise by 2 C and 4 C above pre industrial levels by 2100.

This analysis led us to understand that limiting warming to 2 C would primarily expose us to economic and regulatory transition risks, whereas a 4 C warming level would expose us to unprecedented physical risks.

In 2021, as new scientific evidence was released by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the global consensus around the need for governments to commit to a 1.5 C world strengthened, we extended our scenario analyses to assess the impacts of a 1.5 C temperature increase above pre industrial levels by 2100 on our business in 2030, 2039 and 2050.

The IPCC’s sixth assessment report (AR6), the most up to date compendium from the global scientific community on climate change, states that limiting warming to 1.5 C above pre industrial levels is necessary to prevent the severe environmental consequences that are likely to occur in a 2 C warmer world, and the catastrophic impacts that would materialise if temperatures rose by 4 C.

However, it also noted that achieving a 1.5 C world would still imply major disruption and would necessitate a fast and aggressive transition of our global economy, encompassing policy and regulation, production and consumption systems, societal and economic structures and behaviours, and infrastructure development and deployment of new technologies.

The IPCC also sets out multiple pathways that the world could take to limit global warming to 1.5 C. The nature of the pathway taken significantly impacts the risks and opportunities that a business will face.

In assessing the material risks and opportunities Unilever would face in a world focused on achieving 1.5 C we have reviewed in detail two pathways, proactive’ and reactive’, that we assessed as more likely than other more extreme possible pathways.

In the proactive’ route, there is an early and steady reduction of emissions as a result of a fast response from all economic actors, meaning there is less dependence on technological advancements to remove carbon from the atmosphere in the second half of the century.

Conversely, in the reactive’ route, significant action by economic actors is delayed to 2030, after which a very rapid transition across all actors is required, accompanied by deployment at a very large scale of low carbon energy and carbon removal activities and technology.

In creating our 1.5 C scenario analysis, we took the two pathways and considered the five broad types of risks and opportunities using the TCFD risk framework: Regulatory risks Market risks Physical environment risks Innovative products and services opportunities and Resource efficiency, resilience, and market opportunities.

We identified approximately 40 specific risk and opportunity areas which could impact us in 2030, 2039 and 2050, each of which we assessed qualitatively, supported where possible with high level quantitative assessments.

The assessments are based on financial scenarios and do not represent financial forecasts.

They exclude any actions that we might undertake to mitigate or adapt to these risks.

The quantitative assessments were developed to understand high level materiality and order of magnitude financial impact rather than perform detailed simulations or forecasts on the long term future of markets and products.

The data used was from internal environmental, operational, and financial data and external science based data and assumptions from reputable and broadly used sources such as the IPCC or the International Energy Agency.

Out of all the risks and opportunities we assessed as part of our 1.5 C scenario assessment, there are 11 which we believe are significant and could at some time in the future be material to our business.

We have combined the outputs from the proactive’ and reactive’ analyses since the risks and opportunities are similar, with the differences only being in the size and timing of impact.

Due to the nature of climate risks and opportunities we are monitoring them across a number of time horizons.

Short term (up to three years) this aligns with our three year strategic plans, medium term (three to ten years) and long term (beyond ten years).

Where we have been able to quantify the risk, the ranges represent potential impacts of the different pathways.

Actions to mitigate the risks and capitalise on the opportunities have been consolidated into our Compass strategy (page 4) and our CTAP (pages 35 to 41).

Below we summarise the 11 risks and opportunities.

Given the nature of our products, all of the risks noted below are applicable to all our Business Groups and there are only modest variations in their relative significance for each Business Group.

For more details on key targets, see pages 60 to 61.

This includes carbon taxes and voluntary removal or offset costs.

Tightening regional or national regulations as well as climate commitments across individual businesses could drive widespread implementation of these taxes or market schemes.

This could translate into rising direct and indirect costs linked to carbon emissions, where the strongest impact would likely be on costs of sales linked to raw materials, production, and distribution emissions.

Carbon taxes on household emissions or costs passed through to our consumers linked to household emissions may impact their disposable income and ultimately their purchasing power.

All Business Groups could be impacted by carbon taxes or voluntary removal costs.

Per unit of consumption, our Ice Cream business has the highest carbon emissions from the use of dairy ingredients and the energy used in ice cream storage transport point of sale freezer cabinets.

The highest absolute carbon emissions from sourcing materials, production and distribution, is in Home Care whereas it is lowest in Beauty Wellbeing.

We have developed a CTAP which sets out in detail activities to reduce our carbon emissions.

For example, our eco efficiency programmes aim to reduce energy demand and emissions in our operations, and beyond our operations, we are working with agricultural raw material suppliers on climate smart agriculture and aim to cut emissions from energy use in more than 3 million point of sale ice cream cabinets.

We support the use of internal carbon pricing as a tool to help us achieve our zero emissions goal.

We use an internal carbon price of 70 per tonne to inform our investment decision making.

We have developed a CTAP which sets out in detail activities costs.

Tightening regional or national regulations as well as to reduce our carbon emissions.

For example, our eco climate commitments across individual businesses could drive efficiency programmes aim to reduce energy demand and widespread implementation of these taxes or market schemes.

This could translate into rising direct and indirect costs linked we are working with agricultural raw material suppliers on to carbon emissions, where the strongest impact would likely climate smart agriculture and aim to cut emissions from be on costs of sales linked to raw materials, production, and energy use in more than 3 million point of sale ice cream distribution emissions.

We support the use of internal carbon pricing as a tool to help us achieve our zero emissions goal.

We use an internal carbon price of 70 per tonne to inform our investment decision making.

All Business Groups could be impacted by carbon taxes or voluntary removal costs.

Halve greenhouse gas impact of our products across the transport point of sale freezer cabinets.

These could drive reforms to radically restructure current global land use patterns to conserve and expand forest land, serving as the main natural carbon removal solution.

This could reduce land available for food crops, pasture, and timber and hence access to our primary commodities which could drive reduced crop output and increase raw material prices.

We monitor potential land use regulations to ensure we understand their implications so that we can adapt our raw material supply strategy.

In partnership with others, we continue to work towards a deforestation free supply chain for our key agricultural raw materials.

In addition, we are working with farmers across our supply chain to drive sustainable sourcing and regenerative agriculture.

All Business Groups could be impacted by land use regulation.

The majority of our products are derived from agricultural raw materials and thus any limitations placed on land use would have a similar impact across each Business Group.

Specific land use regulations vis vis certain usages crops could impact the Business Groups differently e.g.

These could restrict or ban the use of certain GHG intensive components and ingredients in everyday products.

This would require the redesign of products and packaging to comply, which could increase costs.

All Business Groups could be impacted by product composition regulations.

If there was a ban on the use of GHG intensive ingredients components, then there is a greater likelihood that the impact on our Personal Care and Home Care businesses would be greater than on our other businesses, as some personal care products in certain countries use HFC propellants and in home care, various chemicals such as soda ash are used.

We monitor regulatory developments to ensure that our product composition is compliant and that future innovations products are designed to consider forthcoming climate related legislation.

As part of our CTAP, we are committed to reducing the GHG impact of our products and as part of this, we are reviewing our intensive GHG components and ingredients and looking for substitutions or how changes in their production processes can reduce their GHG emissions.

We have a diverse portfolio of products and offer a range of formats to meet consumer's needs and this helps mitigate the potential impact of restrictions or bans on specific GHG intensive materials.

Specifically on HFC propellants, we are working with regulators to change the regulations to allow the use of alternative propellant systems.

These could increase significantly through pressure from regulators, consumers, and investors.

This could lead to disclosure compliance risks and rising commodity costs linked to radical transition to transparent supply chains, as well as a potential loss of market share to more transparent competitors.

All Business Groups could be impacted by sourcing transparency and product labelling regulations and, given the nature of all the raw materials used, the risk to each Business Group is equal.

We monitor regulatory developments to ensure that our product labelling is compliant and that future innovations products are designed to consider forthcoming climate related legislation.

As part of our CTAP we are committed to improving sourcing transparency, through collaboration with our suppliers, and transparency with consumers through communicating the carbon footprint of our products.

We have a diverse portfolio of products and offer a range of formats to meet consumer's needs and this helps mitigate the potential impact of product labelling regulations.

This means that producers are held accountable for their environmental and social impacts across the product value chain.

This could lead to improvements of lifecycle traceability from sourcing to managing end of life treatment of products and packaging.

Circular product design and manufacturing practices could become a requirement in many regions to incentivise efficient and responsible resource extraction, and pass waste management costs through higher disposal and recycling fees to producers.

We support EPR policies and schemes and we’re investing directly in waste collection, processing and capacity building projects to recycle more plastic.

Innovation is also critical to help develop: Suitable packaging that is fully recyclable and more widely recyclable.

Product formats suitable for refill and reusable packaging solutions.

All Business Groups could be impacted by the extended producer responsibility risk.

Given the nature of our products and their packaging, the risk to each Business Group is equal, apart from Home Care and Personal Care businesses which use sachets to serve the needs of low income consumers.

These sachets are difficult to collect and recycle.

Timeframe: Short term to long term and components.

This could be driven by increased electrification, the deployment of renewable energy solutions, associated transmission, distribution and storage infrastructure, as well as the adoption of emerging low carbon technologies such as biogas, green hydrogen and ammonia.

This could increase our operations, suppliers, and end consumers’ utility costs.

All Business Groups could be impacted by energy transition and rising energy prices and the likely impact would be equal across all the Business Groups.

We mitigate our market risks by decarbonising our operations through eco efficiency measures in our factories, powering our operations with renewables and transitioning heating and cooling for our factories to lower emission and renewable sources (see page 36).

This could potentially lead to increased uncertainty in financial planning and forecasting for key commodities, as well as a higher cost associated with risk management.

Other considerations include potential manufacturing or supply disruptions linked to availability or higher cost of energy and sourced commodities.

All Business Groups could be impacted by energy and commodity market volatility and the likely impact would be equal across all the Business Groups.

We manage commodity price risks through forward buying of traded commodities and other hedging mechanisms.

These could increase significantly through pressure from regulators, consumers, and investors.

This could lead to disclosure compliance risks and rising commodity costs linked to radical transition to transparent supply chains, as well as a potential loss of market share to more transparent competitors.

We monitor regulatory developments to ensure that our product labelling is compliant and that future innovations products are designed to consider forthcoming climate related legislation.

As part of our CTAP we are committed to improving sourcing transparency, through collaboration with our suppliers, and transparency with consumers through communicating the carbon footprint of our products.

All Business Groups could be impacted by sourcing the potential impact of product labelling regulations.

We support EPR policies and schemes and we’re environmental and social impacts across the product value investing directly in waste collection, processing and chain.

This could lead to improvements of lifecycle traceability capacity building projects to recycle more plastic.

Product formats suitable for refill and reusable widely recyclable.

Higher levels of recycled material into our packaging recycling fees to producers.

All Business Groups could be impacted by the extended producer responsibility risk.

These sachets are difficult to collect and recycle.

This could lead to increased droughts while limited resources to irrigate soils could reduce crop outputs.

Water shortages could also impact our manufacturing sites and our ability to supply water based products.

Our consumers could also face water shortages in their everyday activities in certain regions, creating a need for water smart or waterless products or services.

All Business Groups could be impacted by water scarcity.

Given the nature of our products, the impact of drought on crop production would be equal across all Business Groups.

However, the impact of water shortages on consumers would likely impact their washing behaviours and hence impact the Personal Care and Home Care businesses to a greater extent.

We mitigate physical environment risks by investing in new products and formulations that work with less water, poor quality water or no water.

Many of our hair care products now have fast rinse technology as standard, using less water.

We are working with local communities to develop water stewardship programmes.

We monitor changing weather patterns on a short term basis and integrate weather system modelling into our forecasting process.

This could significantly disrupt our entire value chain.

Sustained high temperatures could lead to reduced crop outputs due to reduction in soil productivity which could translate into higher raw material prices.

Weather events such as hurricanes or floods, which would become increasingly common and intense, could cause plant outages or disrupt our distribution infrastructure.

Additionally, macroeconomic negative shocks, caused by extreme weather events, could reduce or destroy consumer demand and purchasing power among affected communities.

We have extreme weather contingency plans which we implement as necessary to secure alternative key material supplies at short notice or transfer or share production between manufacturing sites.

We manage commodity price risks through forward buying of traded commodities and other hedging mechanisms.

Our Regenerative Agriculture Principles and Sustainable Agriculture Code encourage our agricultural raw material suppliers to adopt practices which increase their productivity and resilience to extreme weather and we aim to increase the hectares of protected and regenerated land.

All Business Groups could be impacted by extreme weather, the most likely significant impact being the reduction of crop outputs which, given the nature of our products, would impact the Business Groups equally.

We mitigate physical environment risks by investing in new irrigate soils could reduce crop outputs.

Water shortages could products and formulations that work with less water, poor also impact our manufacturing sites and our ability to supply quality water or no water.

Many of our hair care products water based products.

Our consumers could also face water now have fast rinse technology as standard, using less shortages in their everyday activities in certain regions, creating water.

Key targets: crop production would be equal across all Business Groups.

Personal Care and Home Care businesses to a greater extent.

This could significantly disrupt our entire value chain.

We have extreme weather contingency plans which we high temperatures could lead to reduced crop outputs due to implement as necessary to secure alternative key material reduction in soil productivity which could translate into higher supplies at short notice or transfer or share production raw material prices.

Weather events such as hurricanes or between manufacturing sites.

We manage commodity price floods, which would become increasingly common and risks through forward buying of traded commodities and intense, could cause plant outages or disrupt our distribution other hedging mechanisms.

Principles and Sustainable Agriculture Code encourage our caused by extreme weather events, could reduce or destroy agricultural raw material suppliers to adopt practices which consumer demand and purchasing power among affected increase their productivity and resilience to extreme weather communities.

Help protect and regenerate 1.5 million hectares of land the Business Groups equally.

As people become more environmentally conscious and there is regulation on land use, we could see a rise in plant based diets away from animal based protein.

We're capitalising on innovative product and service opportunities by offering a range of vegan and vegetarian products.

This represents a shift to efficient and less centralised energy supply and consumption (e.g.

This could drive decarbonisation across the value chain, while opening up the opportunity to access the utility market as an off grid generator and create new revenue streams from grid balancing or demand side response services or providing excess renewable power of oversized capacity to supply chain partners.

We capitalise on resource efficiency opportunities by generating renewable electricity at our factory sites where feasible (see page 36), targeting emissions reduction from our logistics suppliers and own vehicle fleet (see page 38) and through product reformulations which make our products more resource efficient in use for example, many of our laundry products are now low temperature washing as standard (see page 19).

We have undertaken high level quantitative assessments for six risks and opportunities.

These assessments show the gross impact before any action which Unilever might take to respond.

The ranges reflect the different results from the reactive ( ) and proactive ( ) pathways assessed.

We first undertook scenario analysis in 2017 on 2 C and 4 C scenarios.

The results of this work on the way to 1.5 C is consistent with this previous work.

The key differences are due to: the more extreme measures that would need to be taken to achieve a 1.5 C outcome the evolution of the scientific assumptions contained within the IPCC's AR6 report and a more detailed approach to the scenario analysis.

The financial impact in 2030 is more significant in the 1.5 C scenario.

However, the scenario avoids the greater negative impacts from the physical risks associated with higher temperature rise scenarios in 2050 and beyond.

We quantified how high prices from carbon regulations and voluntary offset markets for our upstream Scope 3 emissions might impact our raw and packaging materials costs, our distribution costs and the neutralisation of our residual emissions post 2039.

We quantified how changing land use regulation to promote the conversion of current and future food crops to forests could drive reduced crop output and lead to increased raw material prices, impacting sourcing costs.

We quantified how electricity and gas price increases could impact both total energy annual spend as well as indirect cost increases passed through from raw material suppliers.

We quantified how increased water stressed areas and prolonged droughts would reduce crop outputs due to water scarcity in agricultural regions, decreasing crop viability, and impacting raw material prices.

The results of this work on the way to 1.5 C is consistent with this previous work.

The key differences are due to: the more extreme measures that would need to be taken to achieve a 1.5 C outcome the evolution of the scientific assumptions contained within the IPCC's AR6 report and a more detailed approach to the scenario analysis.

We first undertook scenario analysis in 2017 on 2 C and 4 C scenarios.

The price of carbon offsetting would distribution costs and the neutralisation reach 65 USD tonne by 2050 of our residual emissions post 2039.

We quantified how extreme weather events such as sustained high temperatures could impact crop output and therefore sourcing costs across key commodities.

We quantified the potential revenue opportunity from anticipated growth in the global plant based foods market and possible market share in 2025.

The analysis suggests that policy interventions and changing socio economic trends, such as regulations related to carbon pricing, land use, product composition, sourcing transparency and product labelling, and EPR would have the most significant impact on our value chain along the journey to a 1.5 C world.

The next level of impact would be as a result of the transition of the energy system with rising energy prices and market volatility.

We would also experience the impact of physical environment risks associated with a warmer climate, even in a 1.5 C world.

While the potential risks and financial impact of limiting global warming to 1.5 C are significant if no mitigating actions are taken, the impact of the potential risks that would exist if we were not to reduce warming to 1.5 C are potentially even more significant.

The outcomes from our analysis provide us with initial high level insights into these potential business and financial impacts.

These form an important input to our strategic planning process.

In summary, the radical and disruptive system wide transformation we could face in the journey to limit warming to 1.5 C by 2100, would present a significant range of material risks, where regulatory and economic risks would be the most disruptive.

However, many opportunities would also emerge, which we would be well placed to seize given our ambitious commitments are aligned with a proactive route towards net zero by 2039.

There is still much to do to advance our understanding of the risk and opportunities facing our business and our industry, and our strategic responses to such a radically different future.

This analysis represents an important step to continue to engage and challenge our business and our stakeholders to define how we can make sustainable living commonplace.

Our CTAP includes key metrics and targets to assess and manage climate risks and opportunities across our value chain.

Two of the targets have been recognised as science based targets by the Science Based Targets initiative see page 38 for more details.

A summary of the climate metrics and targets we are currently able to measure can be found on pages 38 to 41, and form part of these TCFD disclosures.

We quantified how changing land use regulation to promote the conversion of current and future food crops to forests could drive reduced crop output and lead to increased raw material prices, impacting sourcing costs.

We quantified how electricity and gas price increases could impact both total energy annual spend as well as indirect cost increases passed through from raw material suppliers.

We quantified how increased water stressed areas and prolonged droughts would reduce crop outputs due to water scarcity in agricultural regions, decreasing crop viability, and impacting raw material prices.

UPS’s shareholders, customers, suppliers, communities and employees care about sustainability, and so do we.

And that’s why we’re focused on hitting our 2025 goals on our road to carbon neutrality by 2050 and improving 1 billion lives by 2040.

We have data driven action plans to invest in planet friendly solutions while taking care of our people and serving our customers and communities of today and tomorrow.

Energized by our better and bolder strategic framework, I’m confident we will help deliver a greener, healthier and more equitable world for us all.

At UPS, we know determined people working together can accomplish anything.

That determination, instilled by our founder Jim Casey, is what motivates UPSers to solve the challenges brought on by climate change.

We made good progress in 2022 but have more work to do when it comes to delinking carbon emissions from our growth and reducing our air emissions.

Going forward, we will continue to use our scale and people, alongside our customers, suppliers and public private partners, to deliver real change.

UPS is reimagining our network with innovation driven investments that include electric ground and air vehicles, cleaner burning fuel and climate conscious facilities.

Our tangible progress shows how we’re tracking against our goals, and our commitment to our targets.

We empower our diverse 500,000 UPSers worldwide to help us deliver impact.

UPSers are problem solvers and dedicated stewards of our environment and communities who do more than just deliver packages together, they deliver good in the world.

We collaborate with customers, suppliers and public private partners to deliver innovative solutions and social impact.

Together we’re creating a more sustainable, equitable and inclusive world.

Moving our world forward by delivering what matters.

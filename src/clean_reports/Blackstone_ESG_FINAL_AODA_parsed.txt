Innovate solutions to advance a net zero future and ensure climate measures are met under the Paris Agreement.

As one of Canada’s leading energy management advisors, we’ve set ourselves an ambitious target for 2023: a 20% increase in avoided carbon costs across our client portfolio vs. 2021 baseline year.

We’ll get there by helping our clients leverage customized solutions that are designed to reduce emissions and improve efficiency at the same time.

Carbon Reduction Roadmap Our Greenhouse Gas Reduction Roadmap and Action Plan (GRRAP) helps clients establish a low carbon strategy, set targets and anticipated outcomes.

Every GRRAP defines, designs and assesses both greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction measures and energy conservation opportunities, while pinpointing impacts on operating costs.

Identified Carbon Energy Cost Savings You can’t cut what you can’t see, so we use a suite of products and services to provide clients with real time data that turn insight into action.

Incentive Grant Support Leaving investment or incentive dollars on the table only serves to slow down sustainability efforts.

That’s why we proactively monitor the market for funding opportunities, track deadlines and help submit applications on our clients’ behalf.

We also support clients who secure their own funding by acting as a developer and general contractor, if needed.

Renewable Energy Projects On site renewable energy sources are an increasingly accessible way to accelerate low carbon strategies and gain a buffer against volatile electricity costs.

Blackstone continues to collaborate with clients on a growing number of renewables projects.

As an example, progress fulfillment on energy conservation and GHG reduction project implementation is recorded annually during our Broader Public Sector updates, filed on behalf of our clients.

Moreover, every five years we work with our clients to complete O. Reg.

We are engaged to provide comprehensive annual updates of their GRRAP Manager Data and project progress.

EV Charging Infrastructure We’re partnering on a range of EV charging infrastructure projects, providing system design and charger install, cost impact studies, and recovery analysis and tools to drive easier uptake of this critical low emissions technology.

Innovating new and better ways to manage natural gas use and reduce Scope 1 2 GHG emissions is at the core of our commitment to drive down energy emissions across our client portfolio by 40% by 2030, compared to 2018.

Carbon Neutrality Blackstone makes regular contributions to global carbon neutrality that go beyond environmental benefits and carbon absorption avoidance.

Our climate contributions support the aims of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including positive social benefits, biodiversity and gender equality.

Our climate contribution supports Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) REDD program, which is administered through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) pays developing countries to protect their forests.

The UN examines and annually verifies PNG’s forest protection work, and also investigates any deforestation and logging.

If PNG protects more than it cuts down, they earn Result Units , also called carbon credits.

Blackstone bought prior assessed forest periods to neutralize our past corporate emissions.

We have supported this sovereign based carbon credits program by covering off our own estimated emissions out to 2030.

We urge all corporations to make similar contributions to global carbon neutrality by cleaning the slate with nature based, carbon neutral contributions (CNCs).

Such support will encourage rainforest nations to improve conservation and sustainable management.

Nature based credits that protect powerful carbon sinks such as old growth and rainforests recognize that trees are worth more to the planet alive, than dead.

We encourage all other nations to adapt a similar net GHG inventory program for all nature based initiatives.

Without a national carbon balance sheet, it will be difficult to determine if progress is being made towards a net zero goal.

Our lens on sustainability goes beyond the environment and is linked with social benefits.

Natural Gas Reduction: Client Facilities For our client managed accounts, natural gas emissions intensity declined between 2018 2021.

However, the COVID 19 pandemic played a part in these reductions as facilities saw reduced capacity and output, and hence lower natural gas consumption.

Blackstone remains committed to ensuring further emissions declines on a YoY basis using 2018 as our baseline.

In our efforts to take all our clients to net zero by 2050, we will continue to work with clients to source green energy supply.

PNG will ban deforestation by 2030 if they get the support they need to sustainably manage their forests.

Emissions Reduction Opportunities We’re making it easy for clients to choose more responsible energy sources by continuously researching lower emission alternatives including those that don’t require major capital expenditures while sourcing credits and using other financial instruments.

This carbon neutral fuel source is derived by capturing and cleaning industrial methane emissions from organic waste.

It reduces the need for conventional fuel while cutting production and waste disposal costs.

Featuring a transparent production process that compares producers to find the least carbon intensive option, it also offers transparency on methane leakage.

Validated carbon sequestration efforts can neutralize scope 1,2, 3 emissions.

Efforts include nature based sequestration i.e., reforestation, avoided nature loss (deforestation) and the improvement of technology based removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (DAC CCS).

Verified environmental attributes from renewable electricity generation projects, such as solar and wind, can be purchased but also traded and sold on the open market.

Section 04: Appendix Sustainability in the Workplace.

What we put on and in the earth is as important as what we put on and in our bodies.

The carbon landscape is a complicated and rapidly changing one, so we adhere to and monitor environmental compliance policies in a way that offers both transparency and accountability.

We help clients understand their federal, provincial and state emission reduction requirements in order to meet net zero emissions by 2050.

In Canada, the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPPA) and associated regulations, including the Output Based Pricing System (OBPS) and Emissions Performance Standards (EPS), operationalize Canada’s commitment to achieve our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).

We abide by these regulations and policy measures.

In the United States, they set a Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce net GHG emissions by 50 52% by 2030 and launched the Global Methane Pledge to advance their climate action domestically and internationally.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is a step towards greater federal action on climate change and supports the overarching vision of building a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable economy.

Globally, the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC) is a voluntary initiative that allows countries, private sector, and stake holders to collectively share their best practices on carbon pricing policies, disseminate research, and inspire action towards implementation of carbon pricing around the world.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides policymakers with regular scientific assessments of climate data, showcases implications and potential future risks, and offers a wealth of statistics and methodologies for governments to estimate their greenhouse gas emissions and removals.

Our emission reduction targets aim to align with international guidelines, in order to contribute our part in this global climate crisis.

Social and environmental factors cannot be uncoupled from our procurement practices.

Some of the ways we are addressing our emissions are as follows: procuring energy efficient equipment at our head office includes long lifespan energy efficient LED lighting and sub metering monitoring systems to track and reduce consumption.

Our waste diversion program aims to redirect 95% of all office waste from landfill.

While our ability to manage some waste at our head office does rely on the infrastructure set up with our landlords, we fully participate with them on responsible on site paper recycling programs to help ensure landfill diversion.

Electronics and other supply recycling is handled directly by Blackstone including computers, printer cartridges, batteries, and select office supplies through programs such as Xerox Green World Alliance, Recycle My Electronics and Staples Canada Terracycle.

What we put on and in the earth is as important as what we put on and in our bodies.

We are careful to secure products for use in our office that include verifications such as B Corporation, Environmental Choice, and EcoLogo (cleaning).

Further, we look for validations from the Forest Stewardship Council (for paper products), Leaping Bunny (cosmetic cleaning products) which ensure cruelty free testing in products and biodegradability certification to protect our oceans and water sources.

Water conservation is managed by a no plastic water bottle policy and we provide filtered water with reusable glassware.

Conestoga set an aggressive goal to cut campus wide baseline GHG emissions by 80% by 2050, and turned to Blackstone for a custom built solution.

We designed and installed a half megawatt solar field and a 250 ton geothermal heat pump at the College’s Cambridge campus.

The system proved so effective, Cambridge Campus total emissions reduction reached 90%, exceeding their original goal.

Conestoga now generates 800 MWh of its own clean, sustainable energy annually.

The school’s GHG emitting natural gas boilers, chillers and cooling towers are a thing of the past more than 5000m3 of natural gas has already been saved.

Conestoga is now a recognized leader in the higher education community with improved brand awareness.

Section 04: Appendix Sustainability in the Workplace.

Blackstone built a comprehensive Greenhouse Gas Reduction Roadmap Action Plan (GRRAP) for LHSC so both facilities staff and leadership teams have an actionable strategy and a suite of tools to meet ambitious targets.

We believe in an inclusive work environment for all team members, one that is engaging, safe and positive.

In our continued efforts to build the best possible work environment, we have committed to maintaining an 85% or greater employee satisfaction rate in our annual employee survey.

Health Wellness Benefits Our employee focused, comprehensive benefits package is fully funded by the company and ranks above industry standards across several benefits.

This includes employee and dependent life coverage, as well as for our employees’ and their families’ most in demand benefits such as chiropractic, psychology, physiotherapy, and massage therapy.

Work Life Balance We take a two pronged approach to ensuring our team members can be their best and do their best, whether they’re at work or at home.

That begins with a clear cut disconnect from work policy so that time away from work is, in fact, time away from work.

We’ve also committed to a remote first workplace model.

Giving employees the flexibility to choose where they work is part of our strategy for adapting to and thriving in the new COVID 19 context, while helping us reduce our Scope 3 carbon emissions.

For those times that demand collaboration and team building, we bring the entire group together.

Risk Management Our robust business continuity plans ensure business resumption and data security in the case of natural disaster risk.

Moreover, we are working towards an enterprise wide risk management program that will focus on internal controls, risk identification and assessment, and mitigation strategies for the organization.

We have developed an organizational risk heat map and strategies for managing both performance and growth regarding climate risk management.

Climate Strategy We take a two pronged approach here.

Our in depth knowledge of carbon compliance regulations and carbon management, including both government mandates and voluntary reduction tools.

We help clients participate in carbon credit markets so they can meet their emission reduction targets and achieve their ESG goals.

We regularly monitor existing and new regulatory practices that incentivize the purchase of compliance credits.

Electricity Regulations, Greenhouse Gas Offset Credit System and REDD all of which aid in the transition towards clean energy and sup port international emission reduction projects.

Carbon Credits Blackstone has purchased United Nations REDD Results Units (RRUs), nature based credits.

In fact, Blackstone was the first non Sovereign Nation to be allowed to purchase them.

We continue to monitor our carbon footprint estimates versus actual.

Where we are not able to control the reduction of GHGs we will top up any excess with additional credits.

We expect to buy RRUs again as they are the only form of offset credit that takes into consideration the whole issuing nation’s total net GHG inventory.

As it relates to our clients’ climate strategies, we help them purchase carbon credits per their determined regulated and voluntary climate action plan.

Moreover, we assist in various climate based solutions as we recognize the collateral ESG impact that ensues given the unique nature of each of our clients.

ESG Education Our second area of focus is ESG Education.

Our team boasts a diverse expertise to inform strategic decisions, behavioral change, infrastructure transformation and communi cation across both our own and our clients’ climate journeys.

We have taken a variety of positions in helping organizations define the operational bounds of net zero, such as road mapping their journey, aligning with an industry leading definition, defining the regulatory approach to net zero, re evaluating procurement decisions, and intimately guiding their strategy towards a net zero future.

We recognize that the complexity of net zero requires a unique approach and definition for each organization.

We are dedicated to safe and healthy working conditions, adhering to the strictest health and safety standards in the province, and have a clean WSIB record.

As part of our enterprise risk program, we document our internal controls and assess and measure risks the organization faces using an Internal Control Matrix.

Blackstone adopts the COSO framework as a guide to identify and define risks and objectives for this purpose.

Our Performance Scorecard has four pillars Financial, Sales Enablement Growth, Talent Diversity, and Risk Management.

Under each category, drivers and KPIs are defined and tracked for performance purposes.

The scorecard fosters transparency, aligns strategic goals and defines tangible actions that will help us manage our financial and operational wellbeing.

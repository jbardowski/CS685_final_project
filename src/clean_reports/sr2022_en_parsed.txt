We believe that empowering members of society to effectively confront environmental and social issues is an integral part of our mission as a financial institution.

The ongoing trend toward decarbonization is expected to result in major changes in global industrial structure which, in turn, will position MUFG and its customers to address risks affecting their business continuity as well as seize opportunities for growth.

Aiming to realize smooth transition to a decarbonized society and creating a sustainable society by fostering a virtuous cycle between the environment and economy, we have been promoting our climate change related initiatives at a robust pace since announcing the MUFG Carbon Neutrality Declaration in May 2021.

In April 2022, we published the MUFG Progress Report and announced interim targets to achieve net zero greenhouse gas GHG emissions from our financed portfolio in the power and oil gas sectors.

In June, all MUFG companies in Japan shifted contracted electricity to 100% renewable energy.

To realize carbon neutrality, it is important not only to achieve net zero GHG emissions in our own operations but also support the decarbonization efforts of our customers.

Thus far, MUFG has furthered customer engagement with about 550 companies in Japan and overseas to identify the challenges and needs of each customer.

Through these engagement efforts, we have simultaneously been reinforcing a diverse range of services to respond to identified needs, such as helping calculate their GHG emissions and TCFD disclosure consulting services.

In September, we drafted the MUFG Transition White Paper to bundle extensive information about decarbonization initiatives at Japanese companies, the environment surrounding energy policy in Japan, and other such topics, in addition to engaging in an exchange of ideas with policymakers overseas.

By genuinely supporting customers tackle their challenges, I hope MUFG can drive decarbonization efforts together.

As a leading global company, MUFG engages and plays our part in international initiatives that meet pressing issues head on.

The Net Zero Banking Alliance NZBA is one such initiative in which we are committed to communicating our views as an Asian representative in the Steering Group.

We are also a member of its six working groups and chair of one, where we are directly involved in developing an international framework for transition financing.

MUFG will continue to contribute to decarbonization initiatives globally through engaging with clients, supporting technological advances that promote decarbonization, establishing rules, commercialization, market creation, and many other such measures.

The system is designed to re flect the degree of improvement found through the external ratings granted by five major ESG rating agencies withthe interests of its diverse stakeholders.

To incentivize efforts to improve MUFGâ€™s earnings power, capital efficiency and profit structure, each of which is considered a management issue requiring the utmost priority, the degree of achievement vis vis target levels stipulated in the Medium Term Business Plan (MTBP) regarding consolidated ROE and consolidated expense reduction (excluding performance linked expense) is determined on an absolute evaluation basis.

Dow Jones and CDP) is determined on an absolute evaluation basis, with the aim of objectively assessing the recipientâ€™s contribution to MUFGâ€™s initiatives to address ESG issues in a variety of fields.

ESG related assessment items subject to qualitative evaluation include contribution to the resolution of environmental and social concerns, the promotion of inclusion diversity and the strengthening and upgrading of MUFGâ€™s governance structure.

The TCFD recommendations propose that climate change related risks and opportunities be disclosed upon grasping impacts on business strategy and f inances.

Under the MUFG Way, which guides all of our activities, MUFG has established the MUFG Environmental Policy Statement as a specific action guideline for practicing environmental considerations.

The MUFG Environmental Policy Statement has been the matter to be determined in the Board of Directors since May 2021.

The Policy Statement clearly states the company's commitment to proactively disclose information on the environment, including climate change.

In April 2021, we defined our purpose as being Committed to empowering a brighter future.

Since then, we have been implementing our medium term business plan, led by a heightened commitment to helping resolve environmental and social issues.

To better contribute to building a sustainable environment and society, MUFG has selected 10 priority environmental and social issues with an eye on better fulfilling societyâ€™s expectations in areas where MUFGâ€™s strengths can be applied.

One of the priorities we especially focus on is climate change measures and environmental protection.

We have always been proactive in addressing climate change and environmental protection issues.

It included formulating the MUFG Environmental and Social Policy Framework for assessing and managing the risks associated with our business activities as well as setting sustainable finance targets.

Japanese governmentâ€™s Carbon Neutrality Declaration.

In the MUFG Progress Report issued in April 2022, we reported on the progress of MUFG's carbon neutrality initiatives and the measures that we are taking.

In addition to the results and targets, we also reported on our approach to achieving them and our thought process on which they are based.

MUFG s initiatives in detail, we hope to work together with wide range of stakeholders to achieve a sustainable environment and society.

MUFG joined NZBA in June 2021 after announcing the Carbon Neutrality Declaration.

NZBA members share a common goal: net zero financed portfolios by 2050.

They are also required to set interim targets for 2030 or earlier using a science based approach.

We are committed to helping achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement by achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and at the same time, supporting a smooth transition to a decarbonized society through our financial services, and proactively contributing to creating a sustainable society by fostering a virtuous cycle between the environment and the economy.

Today, we have set interim targets for 2030, aligned with the Paris Agreement.

We recognize that the processes for achieving these targets vary depending on the characteristics of each region and business.

We are also aware that our business is greatly affected by geopolitical risks and other factors, so we will share issues that we find through engagement (dialogue) with customers and support them to help resolve these issues.

Innovations which are still in the conceptual stage is another indispensable element for the world to achieve decarbonization.

We believe that there is a gap between the real world and the goal that is yet to be materialized.

Therefore, our aspiration is to further contribute to the changes where the world advances more towards decarbonization by developing research on new technologies for implementation.

To reflect our stance mentioned above, we have set ranged interim targets in order to work together with our stakeholders to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050.

To reflect our stance mentioned above, we have set ranged interim targets in order to work together with our stakeholders to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050.

Net zero GHG emissions from the financed portfolio means decarbonizing the sector portfolio by reducing the GHG (Scope3) generated through financing customers and projects.

GHG emissions from the financed portfolio are defined as financed emissions .

This is the amount of GHG emissions attributed to each financial institution through financing each customer or project.

MUFG uses the calculation model recommended by the PCAF.

MUFG uses outstanding credit amount which includes the undrawn amount of commitment in order to reflect our credit stance as a financial institution more accurately.

We have adopted the following four approaches to setting the interim target.

Going forward, we will reflect the changes in the IEA (International Energy Agency) scenario and various guidelines, as well as the increase in the quality of data disclosed by our customers, as appropriate.

As a benchmark for 1.5 C, we will refer to scientific scenarios published by IEA and others.

When data is updated or new data is disclosed, improvements in accuracy and quality will be reflected.

MUFG will also contribute to improving data accuracy by being highly transparent when disclosing information.

MUFG believes that targets should be set from a global perspective using widely accepted and transparent methods.

We participate in various initiatives, collecting insights and reflecting them in the targets we set.

SBTi etc., as well as the outcomes of the global working groups which we participate in.

As a benchmark for 1.5 C, we will refer to scientific scenarios published by IEA and others.

However, there are limits to the amount and quality of data currently available, so we will use the PCAF data quality score to check the quality of emissions data disclosed by MUFG.

When data is updated or new data is disclosed, improvements in accuracy and quality will be reflected.

MUFG will also contribute to improving data accuracy by being highly transparent when disclosing information.

MUFG believes that targets should be set from a global perspective using widely accepted and transparent methods.

We participate in various initiatives, collecting insights and reflecting them in the targets we set.

We will proceed with target setting, incorporating guidelines and rules developed by NZBA, PCAF, PACTA, and SBTi etc., as well as the outcomes of the global working groups which we participate in.

Pathways and the methods to achieve carbon neutrality vary by sector, so for each sector we will take into consideration the characteristics of the business, the guidelines and the targets set by each customer.

By taking this approach, MUFG will identify issues in each sector and support customersâ€™ efforts for achieving carbon neutrality.

Sector analysis, (3) Determine methodologies and measure GHG emissions, and (4) Set interim targets.

The NZBA Guidelines define nine carbon intensive sectors that should be prioritized when setting targets: agriculture aluminium cement coal commercial residential real estate iron steel oil gas power generation and transport.

Among these sectors, MUFG especially puts priority on the power and the oil gas sectors for the following reasons.

CO emissions from the power sector account for approximately 40% of global CO emissions.

CO emissions from fuels and therefore important for reducing GHG emissions from fossil fuels.

Both sectors have relatively large financed emissions in the MUFG portfolio.

Both sectors have relatively well developed data and methodologies.

In the transition stage to a decarbonized society, the demand for power is expected to increase due to economic growth in developing countries and the electrification of industry.

The policies and initiatives of each country are important because the business model of this sector is local and therefore has particularly strong regional characteristics.

Electricity demand under the IEA 1.5 C scenario (IEA NZE scenario in which the increase in the global surface temperature rise is limited to 1.5 C with a 50% or greater probability of success) is estimated to grow by 39% by 2030 and 166% by 2050 (compared with 2020).

Sector analysis, (3) Determine methodologies and measure GHG emissions, and (4) Set interim targets.

Among these sectors, MUFG especially puts priority on the power and the oil gas sectors for the following reasons.

CO emissions from the power sector account for approximately 40% of global CO emissions.

Oil gas are widely consumed by industry and households, accounting for approximately 50% of global CO emissions from fuels and therefore important for reducing GHG emissions from fossil fuels.

Both sectors have relatively large financed emissions in the MUFG portfolio.

Both sectors have relatively well developed data and methodologies.

In the transition stage to a decarbonized society, the demand for power is expected to increase due to economic growth in developing countries and the electrification of industry.

So, the power sector will need to shift to renewable energy and low carbon fuels, while ensuring a stable supply of energy The policies and initiatives of each country are important because the business model of this sector is local and therefore has particularly strong regional characteristics.

Electricity demand under the IEA 1.5 C scenario (IEA NZE scenario in which the increase in the global surface temperature rise is limited to 1.5 C with a 50% or greater probability of success) is estimated to grow by 39% by 2030 and 166% by 2050 (compared with 2020).

On the other hand, a large amount of this sectorâ€™s GHG emissions is due to cross industrial consumption (Scope 3), indicating that decarbonization in the oil gas sector cannot be achieved without industries and households transitioning away from fossil fuels.

The IEA figures suggest that currently there is a large gap between the demand (IEA APS scenario that is based on the commitments announced by each country) and the 1.5 C scenario.

It is important to promote decarbonization in the demand sectors as well in order to close the gap between these two scenarios.

It is important to promote decarbonization in the demand sectors as well in order to close the gap between these two scenarios.

Following SBTi and PACTA, the value chain and emission scope which we cover is Scope1 of the power generation business, which accounts for the majority of GHG emissions in this sector.

The power sector is expected to take a leading role in driving cross industry decarbonization.

GHG emission intensity, a measure of emission efficiency, will be used as the metric because the power sector needs to support the increasing electricity demand while simultaneously moving ahead with clean energy conversion.

The average PCAF score for the target portfolio that is included in the calculation is 2.4.

In addition to information disclosed by customers, we use data sources, including CDP and Bloomberg, etc.

In cases where GHG emission data is not available, we use production data obtained from these data sources as well as emission intensity information obtained from IEA database, etc.

Customers who do 75 not have GHG emission data or production data are excluded from the calculation, yet we manage to cover more than 85% of our credit portfolio for this sector.

Going forward, we will expand our target coverage and improve data quality reflected in our PCAF score in line with enhanced data availability.

The power sector has a local business model with strong regional characteristics, and is expected to take a leading role in promoting each NDC with governments.

The power sector has a local business model with strong regional characteristics, and is expected to take a leading role in promoting each NDC with governments.

In addition to the above, we aim for 156gCO e(cid:18)(cid:78)(cid:58)h(cid:15) which is consistent with the IEA 1.5 C scenario in 2030(cid:15) b(cid:92) making further contributions to the promotion of renewable energy, etc.

According to PACTA, upstream businesses of fossil fuel sectors are important as they have significant impact on other segments down the value chain.

Therefore MUFG focuses on the upstream of the value chain, which have the largest environmental impact.

The emission scope which we look into covers not only Scope1 and Scope2 but also Scope3, from which the majority of GHG emissions from this sector is generated.

The average PCAF score for the target portfolio that is included in the calculation is 2.6.

In addition to information disclosed by customers, we use data sources, including CDP and Bloomberg, etc.

Customers who do not have GHG emission data or production data are excluded from the scope of calculation, yet we manage to cover more than 85% of our credit portfolio for this sector.

Going forward, we will expand our target coverage and improve data quality reflected in our PCAF score in line with enhanced data availability.

The interim target for 2030 is 15% 28% reduction from 2019.

We will achieve 15% reduction by engaging with our customers and supporting their efforts in reducing GHG emissions.

We aim for 28% reduction which is consistent with the IEA 1.5 C scenario in 2030.

However, to achieve this it is essential for both the oil gas sector (supply side) and the industries (demand side) to simultaneously accelerate decarbonization.

Therefore, we intend to achieve 28% reduction by making contribution to the world to further advance toward decarbonization.

Neutrality Declaration in May 2021, MUFG has reduced approximately 60% of domestic GHG emissions (which is approximately 30% of global GHG emissions).

In addition to our initiatives to reduce energy use through continued energy conservation, we will reduce our gasoline consumption by switching to electric vehicles (EVs) and promote the use of renewable energy sources for electricity to become net zero for GHG emissions by 2030.

Overseas, while accumulating expertise from promoting domestic environmental initiatives and introducing renewable energy at our European business locations, we will accelerate implementing specific measures, taking into account the status of policies and systems to promote decarbonization in each country.

Green power, generated from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and biomass (biological resources), is sent directly from the power plant to the consumer.

Customers can use green power directly as electricity for their own use, rather than deemed to do so.

To achieve net zero GHG emissions in our own operations by 2030, MUFG has measured and aggregated its own GHG emissions on a group and global basis since FY 2020.

In FY 2021, the Bank obtained third party verification for its own GHG emissions in Japan (non consolidated basis).

Going forward, we aim to obtain third party verification for GHG emissions on the group and global basis.

By November 2021, the Bank, the Trust Bank, and the Securities completed switching to 100% renewable energy for their own domestic electricity contracts.

Since the release of the MUFG Carbon Neutrality Declaration in May 2021, we have reduced domestic emissions by approximately 60% (approximately 30% of global emissions).

In June 2022, NICOS and ACOM also completed switching to 100% renewable electricity.

As a result, we were able achieve 100% renewable electricity among all of MUFG's consolidated subsidiaries in Japan for their own contracted electricity, ahead of our initial schedule.

MUFG has entered a long term PPA contract to purchase electricity from solar power generation facilities 79 established by other companies and implemented self consignment, whereby MUFG installs its own solar power generation facilities and consumes the electricity produced.

Through these efforts, we have introduced what is referred to as raw green power for a portion of the electricity used at our business locations and data centers.

At the same time, MUFG itself is involved in the construction of new power generation facilities and purchases renewable power generated from these under long term contracts, which allows MUFG to directly contributes to the increase in the number of renewable power sources, which can be extended to across Japan.

In Japan, we are aiming to switch to 100% EVs by FY 2030.

For this, we have developed detailed plans that take into account the expiration of existing car lease contracts and the surrounding EV charging environment.

We have implemented a GHG emissions management platform at approximately 2,400 of our consolidated subsidiaries in more than 50 countries and regions around the world.

In FY2021, we held MUFG Way Integration Sessions with the objective of encouraging employees to discover how relevant the MUFG Way is to their day to day tasks and actions.

They were then asked to develop their own interpretations of the MUFG Way in light of the policies upheld by the respective branch and division they belong to, and missions currently assigned to them.

These interpretations were shared among attendees, who usually came from the same workplace, and they engaged in free discussions on that basis.

In addition, a cascade down approach was used in these sessions, with Group CEO Kamezawa becoming the first to share his personal definition of the MUFG Way with officers overseeing Group companies.

This sharing of My Way then progressed from officers to general managers of branches and divisions, and from general managers to their staff.

The number of sessions held in Japan and overseas thus exceeded 3,000 and involved more than 50,000 employees.

Comments voiced by participants included, I began to feel a sense of intimacy after hearing the personal life stories of my supervisor and what he she really thinks about his her job, things that I would never have known and The session helped me to recall what I was aiming for when I had just joined the Company.

It was a good opportunity to seriously think about how I envision my contribution to customers and society as a whole.

On the other hand, some participants commented that It is hard to translate the Purpose into my tasks.

Therefore, it can be concluded that we are only halfway to our goal of empowering employees to develop a robust sense of ownership about the Purpose.

We thus are encouraging all employees, including those who are in non managerial positions, to frankly exchange their thoughts on these matters with their supervisors, team members and other colleagues.

Head of Global HR interviewed regional leaders of Inclusion Diversity about the necessity of a global strategy, initiatives and Equity in each region, and future direction.

Initially, our main objective was to improve the job satisfaction of female employees, However, since 2010, we have expanded the scope of our initiatives with the aim of improving the job satisfaction of not only female employees but also diverse employees.

Moving forward, we will further focus our efforts on creating workplaces where all employees of the Group can demonstrate their unique strengths and make diversity empower a brighter future.

MUFG focuses on Inclusion and Diversity (I D) as one of its key strategies, which is one of the 10 Priority Issues in MUFGâ€™s Sustainability Management.

Head of Global HR interviewed regional I D leaders.

Okeatta: When I joined MUFG in 2021, I learned there were several meaningful engagements in process in the Americas, including the launch of an Executive I D Council made up of our CEO, CHRO, and leaders from our Enterprise Resource Groups (ERG) and Business Unit I D Councils, and CSR resulting in several initiatives designed to impact change.

However, there seemed to be a lack of clear goals and objectives aligned to a north star, an I D vision.

The opportunity surfaced to build an enterprise I D strategy that includes success measures that were impactful enough to shift behaviours, which are necessary to transform a culture and effect change internally and externally.

We must invest in I D as a business imperative and a competitive advantage.

Jennifer: EMEA has a clear commitment to I D through our EMEA strategy with strengthening our culture set out as a core pillar.

Our EMEA Employee Network programme is one of many critical components of this and consists of seven resource networks that help us to establish a working environment that embraces and celebrates the diversity of our people.

These networks offer our employees community, connection and a sense of belonging, all of which help to increase and maintain employee engagement.

However, our approach remains very regional and reactive.

From my perspective, the obvious next step for MUFG is a global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) strategy.

Kiat: Iâ€™ve been with the bank for just over 4 years and in this rather short time, I can see I D and cultural transformation has been changed in MUFG, particularly in APAC.

Employees currently in the organization could also see this as an opportunity to progress with their career especially in regions countries where DEI has been neglected for a while.

The world is rapidly changing and more and more issues around I D are being surfaced daily.

Now that DEI is high on everyoneâ€™s agenda, we can better manage this situation by framing the priorities for the teams working on it.

Sayaka: In Singapore where I worked until the beginning of 2021, our colleagues have various nationalities, cultures, careers, and all are very diversified.

After I came back to Tokyo, I again realized that there is a huge gap between Japan and overseas offices.

In Japan, it is homogeneous where most employees in Head Office are Japanese, important roles are assigned to men, etc.

I strongly believe diverse talent will enable us to tackle diverse issues talent, that can leverage their skills through an effective network and courageous communication with colleagues.

Angus: We want to create a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment which fosters all talents for the better of MUFG focusing on diversity of thought, inputs and experience, equity of treatment in all we do and creating an environment that is inclusive for all where all can thrive.

Sayaka: In Japan, one of our top priorities is to solve the gender gap.

We have increased the target % representation of female management in Japan from 18% to 20% by fiscal 2023, but it is still on the way to reach to 30% set out by government.

We are supporting education of women by providing various learning and development programs and mentoring programs, in collaboration with Business Units, etc.

In addition, we are focused on increasing mid career hiring of SMEs (Subject Matter Experts), leadership assignments to locally hired staff and stable employment of people with disabilities and LGBTQ colleagues, moving forward to cultivate an inclusive corporate culture.

Globally, Equity will be introduced to shift to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.

This is not equality in which we provide the same things to various people, but equity where we provide appropriate support to each individual.

I think equity is critical when solving for closing the gap for gender, people with disabilities and SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity), etc.

Kiat: MUFG APAC is a diverse region, 18 different countries, many cultures, languages, and differing legislations impacting each of our respective locations.

Therefore, we seek to become as inclusive as possible through our diversities of gender or races etc.

We are doing this by ensuring we have the right mix of gender diversification at all levels in global, regional and local projects.

Another practical approach, for example: we are setting up diverse employee teams, bringing together all levels, and a wide representation of staff, to give them a voice for continuous improvement and to enable their contribution to business decisions.

Additionally, we have partner banks in the region, and this adds a level of energy and enthusiasm to how we work together and leverage the diversity that they also bring to MUFG APAC.

Jennifer: In EMEA, fostering a culture of collaboration, inclusivity, diversity, empowerment, and high performance is one of the four pillars of our EMEA strategy.

Firstly, we focus on increasing diverse representation in line with the commitments we have made to the Women in Finance Charter and Race at Work Charter.

We link accountability for achieving approved targets to executive performance through our EMEA Leadership objective, by monitoring and reporting on key diversity metrics.

We also implement initiatives to support the learning, development and progression of diverse talent through initiatives such as our Reverse Mentoring programme.

Okeatta: In the Americas, we were able to develop a comprehensive DEI strategy with key performance indicators that include a focus on increasing gender, race, and ethnicity representation at senior levels, DEI learning and leadership development programs, and a plan for building an inclusive culture.

We will use the remainder of the calendar year to operationalize our enterprise DEI strategy to include: 1) enhancing our governance model to leverage a top down and bottom up approach, 2) strengthen accountability at our most senior levels and for all people managers by introducing specific DEI management objectives starting in fiscal 2022, 3) investing in a comprehensive DEI learning and development platform and so on.

Sayaka: We must solve the situation where employees cannot fully utilise their ability due to their identity and environment.

Additional investment in these employees will help to draw on their capabilities and have a positive impact on others, which will facilitate a merit based system, or culture of pay for performance, ensuring that the right person is in the right role.

This will make individuals and our organization resilient, which is a target of pursuing equity.

Each region has different issues, so actions are diversified.

However, our global goal is to ensure equitable opportunities for all employees so they may maximize their capability within an inclusive culture and with psychological safety.

Angus: You are fostering global collaboration in addition to regional focus.

Okeatta: We are working to define a global north star and set clear objectives and key performance indicators to track and measure year over year progress of our journey to becoming the most trusted financial group.

Jennifer: Iâ€™m excited about the progress weâ€™re making towards building an integrated global DEI strategy.

In EMEA, weâ€™ve focused on I D until now but recognise the importance of including equity.

This change will allow us to take a more global approach in reviewing the policies, practices and processes that impact our employees, ensuring that someoneâ€™s identity bears no impact on their ability to achieve their full potential and ambitions at MUFG.

Okeatta: The DEI strategy for the Americas includes a focus on workforce, culture, marketplace, and community.

We must ask ourselves if we are being inclusive when we consider the products and services we offer and procure.

A community focus is also integral to our DEI strategy.

Supporting organizations and strategic collaborations dedicated to social justice, racial equity, gender equity, culture, arts, and economic prosperity within underserved communities through investment, volunteering, and charitable donations demonstrates our commitment to ESG.

Sayaka: I believe that by leveraging our global and regional network, we can lead the discussion with our customers and clients addressing social issues.

This will not only change corporate culture, but also connect to our MUFG Purpose Committed to empowering a bright future.

The simulation doubled the state of the art in simulation size and remains the most comprehensive simulation of the virus performed to date.

Speeding DNA Sequencing for Same day Diagnoses Stanford, google, uC Santa Cruz, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies used rapid DNA sequencing to identify genetic variants and cut the time to diagnosis from two weeks to eight hours.

Predicting Extreme Weather NVIDIA researchers, with scientists at.

Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, created FourCastNet, a machine learning model that can predict the behavior of 1,000 mile long atmospheric rivers tens of thousands of times faster than numerical simulations.

Recent advances in accelerated clinical sequencing were instrumental to humanity’s battle against COVID 19 decoding its genetics, developing treatments, and preventing the next pandemic.

We worked with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Scripps Research to speed the discovery of new drugs, performing a year’s worth of work on the most powerful supercomputer in a single day.

Large scale computers are essential instruments to advance human knowledge and invent a better future.

Yet computers consume energy, and so it is imperative that we do so with the greatest possible energy efficiency.

NVIDIA accelerated computing requires a refactoring of algorithms but delivers orders of magnitude better energy efficiency.

Twenty three of the world’s top 30 most energy efficient supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA.

Accelerating DOE’s Energy Supercomputer’ NVIDIA gPus will power Kestrel, the Department of Energy’s next generation supercomputer dedicated entirely to projects to advance energy solutions research in the u.S.

Carbon Capture AI Scientists from Stanford, CalTech, and Purdue developed an AI tool that can sequester carbon and help lock up greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide in porous rock formations faster and more precisely.

Wind Farm Energy Prediction Startup Zenotech and the u.K. government used AI to predict the likely energy output of a wind farm’s 140 turbines.

NVIDIA gPus and software sped the process by 43x compared to CPus and boosted performance to enable fine grained analysis of the effects the turbines had on each other, and even the effects of leaves falling from the trees in nearby forests.

Industrial Digital Twins The NVIDIA Omniverse simulation platform is enabling digital twins of complex systems like factories, warehouses, and self driving cars.

By prototyping in the virtual world before deploying in the physical one, companies like Amazon, BMW, Ericsson, PepsiCo, and Siemens can save time, energy, and resources.

Earth 2 NVIDIA is building a digital twin of our planet to predict changes in extreme weather decades out.

This simulation of the world will help predict the complex multi physics of Earth’s atmosphere, land, sea, and ice caps at sufficiently high resolution.

Earth 2 will enable us to better predict the regional impacts of human actions over decades.

Our culture of generosity and service is our engine for making positive change at the local and personal level.

Our employees actively support the communities in which they work and live.

They championed fundraisers to aid COVID response efforts, support breast cancer research, and provide food and gifts for low income families during the holidays.

They gave their time to tutor and mentor students, created care kits for first responders and people experiencing homelessness, and consulted with nonprofits through skills based volunteering.

NVIDIA employees joined the company in contributing more than 22 million and 16,500 volunteer hours to charitable causes in fiscal year 2022.

We’ve also donated more than 4.6 million to date for humanitarian relief to ukraine and its refugees.

We continue to work closely to support our ukrainian employees and their families amid Europe’s worst crisis in the past 75 years.

We’re creating new technologies and helping researchers apply them to discover new knowledge.

We’re expanding the accelerated computing ecosystem and helping new markets apply this super efficient way of computing.

I am proud of NVIDIA’s contributions to science, industry, and community.

By creating an environment and culture that attracts extraordinary people to come do their life’s work, NVIDIA can simultaneously create sustainable growth for our stakeholders while doing impactful work that can take decades of effort.

We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to apply accelerated computing and artificial intelligence to take on the most important challenges of our time, from transportation to digital biology to climate science.

I can’t wait to see what we accomplish in the coming years.

We assess our corporate responsibility program annually to ensure that we remain aligned with stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities.

Annually, we determine the topics that are essential to our continued business success and reflect the highest interest to NVIDIA and our stakeholders.

In light of increased prioritization of corporate responsibility internally and externally, we streamlined our corporate responsibility topics from 20 to seven to better reflect their interrelatedness.

We address each of these topics in subsequent sections of this report.

We define each topic, discuss why it’s important to NVIDIA and how we manage it, and disclose relevant performance data.

The Nominating and Corporate governance Committee (NCgC) of our Board is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our practices concerning environmental, social, and corporate governance.

Our head of corporate responsibility reviews stakeholder inputs with and collects feedback on priorities from the NCgC each year.

The priorities include issues that are of utmost importance to our stakeholders, such as climate change, human rights, and diversity and inclusion.

Starting in our fiscal year ending January 29, 2022 (FY23), the Compensation Committee of our Board became responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our policies and strategies relating to human capital management, which includes recruiting, retention, development, diversity, inclusion and belonging, and employment practices.

In our fiscal year ending January 30, 2022 (FY22), NVIDIA management began periodically reporting to the NCgC about the company’s policies and practices regarding governmental relations, public policy, and related expenditures.

We define stakeholders as entities or individuals who can be affected by NVIDIA and whose actions can affect the company.

Regular sessions with trained medical experts were held to help employees focus on their health and well being.

A cross functional team led by HR provides high touch support to help employees or family members to help them through difficult times in their lives.

The focused support will vary depending upon the situation and can cover financial, travel, and medical care needs.

We ensure strong pay for all employees through an annual review of peer compensation practices in the markets we operate in and annual adjustments to employee compensation.

Employees are provided both cash and equity compensation.

Equity compensation is provided through Restricted Stock units (RSus) that vest over time and provide value aligned to our stock price.

We believe RSus promote retention and align with stockholder interests.

Cash compensation adjustments are determined based on market compensation growth and individual performance.

In addition to our annual compensation review, we regularly monitor the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and inflation around the world and adjust employee compensation as needed to address the impact to employee purchasing power.

To ensure pay parity, defined as no statistically significant differences in compensation based on gender, race, or ethnicity, we’ve used a third party firm to analyze our pay practices for gender, race, and ethnicity across 75 dimensions, including rating, education, years of experience, job function, family, and level each year since 2015.

We’ve achieved pay parity for the past several years and plan to continue doing so.

If the review were to identify an issue of statistically significant pay disparity, we would take corrective action.

We also evaluate promotion data to ensure parity across gender, race, and ethnicity.

Our corporate culture arises from five core values, which provide the foundation for success.

These values create a workplace where innovation thrives and mistakes are transformed into opportunities.

We make things that delight customers and raise industry standards.

We encourage employees to innovate, guided by first principles, not consensus.

We know our path to discovery will be paved with mistakes.

We accept, learn from, and share the ones that occur.

This allows us to invent things the world doesn’t even know it needs, and by doing so, invent the future.

We seek to accurately know ourselves and our capabilities acknowledging our weaknesses and learning from our mistakes.

The sharpest understanding of reality improves our work.

Identifying the origins of mistakes is not about blame.

It is essential to learning and constant improvement.

We say what we believe, and have the courage to act on it.

We are alert and constantly learning, and adjust course to align to new realities.

This lets us create groundbreaking products at astonishing speed.

No politics, no hierarchy stands in the way of inventing the future.

We hire extraordinarily talented individuals across the globe, people determined to make a difference.

We measure ourselves not against the competition, but against perfection we call it the speed of light test.

We are not deterred by lengthy endeavors if they are worthy.

We foster an environment of transparency, openness, and sharing information.

One that motivates our employees, and empowers them to work as a single integrated team.

We disagree openly and directly because conflict is essential to resolving differences, improving ideas, and achieving alignment.

By putting the interests of the company before our own, we can more easily accomplish NVIDIA’s vision.

To address the stress of COVID 19 on employees, we’ve promoted awareness of our mental health and wellness programs and encouraged managers to keep employee connections strong with a variety of virtual team building events like cooking challenges, game nights, and happy hours.

We listen to employees through frequent pulse surveys that measure engagement levels and culture against employees’ experiences as we continue to grow.

We analyze data across multiple surveys, along with other data resources, to draw correlations over time and pivot as necessary.

This agile approach allows us to hear from employees more frequently and stay focused on specific areas, while reacting quickly to current events.

Survey topics in FY22 include meaningful work, support to succeed, diversity, inclusion and belonging, and life’s work.

The surveys repeatedly tell us that our employees would recommend NVIDIA as a great place to work.

In addition, we receive feedback through an internal portal where all employees can submit, view, and vote on suggestions.

Over the last year, we’ve converted employee feedback into company wide policies and programs, including the addition of Juneteenth and Veterans Day as office closures in the united States.

We’ve also made updates to our resources based on employee suggestions, such as an internal COVID portal for company communications and updates.

We support several community resource groups (CRgs), which have executive level sponsorship and dedicated budgets: Asian Pacific Islander, Black NVIDIAN Network (BNN), Early Career Network, Hispanic Latino Network, NV Pride (LgBTQ employees and allies), NVIDIA Disabilities Network (NDN), NVIDIA Veterans, South Asian Allies, and Women in Technology (WIT).

These communities are expanding globally and engaging more employees around the world.

CRgs have pages on the company intranet and communicate through Slack, email, and special events.

We listen to these communities and respond with the right programs for all.

In FY22, we partnered with our CRgs to provide mental health resources tailored to the needs of each community.

BNN piloted an onboarding program for employees to request a Friend.

In response to feedback from BNN, our health plan partner Cigna has invited Black physicians and mental health providers used by NVIDIANs to join the network.

NDN formed breakout groups including ADHD NVIDIANs to discuss experiences and share resources in a safe, nonjudgmental, and neurodiverse friendly environment.

It also formed the Parents and Caregivers Support group to provide employees with resources and support.

In response to feedback from NV Pride and partners we work with, we added the capability for employees to voluntarily share and view personal pronouns in the company directory.

We encourage all employees to share their pronouns and, in FY22, 30% of our employees updated their profile with pronouns in support of their NV Pride colleagues.

WIT held development programs on communicating for influence and on patent harvesting.

We curate resources for employees to increase awareness and provide suggestions on how to foster an inclusive environment.

We have reviewed our engineering and other documentation to ensure it is consistent with our code of conduct and principles of inclusivity.

We strive to create an inclusive environment and believe that communication patterns are learned habits and take practice.

We encourage our employees to continue to use inclusive language and to ingrain these positive communication habits.

NVIDIANs share a passion for meaningfully supporting the communities in which we live and do business.

The NVIDIA Foundation, led by four staff members in partnership with employee champions around the world, helps turn this passion for giving into action through our Inspire 365 initiative, which aims to empower all NVIDIANs to get involved in their communities.

Through matching gifts, flexible time off, and a variety of activities and tools, employees can contribute where, when, and how they choose.

Our collective, year round efforts allow us to help those in need and strengthen communities around the globe.

As the COVID 19 pandemic continued into its second year, NVIDIANs remained committed to donating their time and contributing resources to those in need.

Nearly 40% of our employees participated in the Foundation's Inspire 365 efforts during FY22, bringing the unique participation rate since the initiative’s start to 68%.

Through year round giving and a company wide holiday campaign, employees donated a record of more than 9 million, up 18% from the previous year.

While our in person volunteer events remained paused due to COVID related office closures, NVIDIANs still logged more than 16,500 volunteer hours through individual and virtual efforts, up more than 76% compared to FY21.

Through our Missions program, in its second year, we encouraged employees to complete simple acts of good across a variety of themes, including health and well being, inclusion and belonging, environmental sustainability, and disaster response.

Employees took more than 40,000 actions through monthly Missions challenges in FY22.

We partnered with our community resource groups on challenges like Celebrate Pride, Honoring Those with Disabilities, and Vamos a Celebrar Celebrating Hispanic and Latino Culture, which aimed to inspire employees to learn from, honor, and support our colleagues and communities.

One series of Missions focused on reducing our environmental footprint by conserving water, reducing energy consumption, and adopting food habits that lower emissions resulted in more than 140,000 gallons of water, 225,000 kWh of energy, and 32,000 lbs.

Collectively, these efforts supported 5,700 nonprofits in more than 50 countries around the world.

Funding amounts range from 105,000 to more than 2 million.

We have a rich library of live and on demand learning experiences such as workshops, panel discussions, speaker based forums, and internally focused conferences.

We curate learning libraries around our most common development needs, provide the latest platforms to support self paced learning, and regularly improve and update those topics using learner feedback from internal messaging channels.

We offer tuition reimbursement programs and subsidize advanced education programs and online certifications.

To improve the way transgender people were addressed in our workplace harassment training, we worked with the vendor to revise the content, and the subsequent updates impacted every employer that uses the same vendor.

We strive to cultivate an inclusive and equitable mindset through awareness and skill building.

Due to managers’ direct influence on employee engagement, we have invested in developing our managers to become great leaders.

Dedicated communication channels to share ideas, ask questions, and discuss everyday management situations.

A development program for high potential women designed to enhance their leadership capabilities and to prepare them for future advancement and.

We introduced an allyship program to establish and train a network of allies that can speak up when they see non inclusive behavior and advocate for changes that lead to increased equity.

We also created online diversity, inclusion, and belonging educational resources for managers and employees.

We strive to achieve the highest standards of ethical conduct in all our business dealings and are committed to promoting a culture of integrity.

Our code of conduct and policies guide how we conduct ourselves in our professional relationships toward our customers, partners, competitors, vendors, government regulators, shareholders, fellow employees, and the community at large.

This code applies to all our executive officers, directors, and employees, and we expect all third parties we do business with, including consultants, contractors, and other service providers, to act in a manner consistent with it.

All NVIDIA employees receive code of conduct, ethics, and sexual harassment training upon hire and then every two years thereafter.

Employees who have frequent contact with customers, partners, and suppliers (such as those in sales, finance, and procurement) have completed additional global anti bribery and anti corruption training.

As of March 2022, nearly 100% of employees had completed the trainings.

Our commitment to promoting a culture of integrity means that we aim to foster an environment where everyone is expected to act ethically and feel empowered to voice concerns without fear of retaliation.

Any employee can confidentially and anonymously lodge a complaint about any matter of concern including accounting, internal control, auditing, code of conduct, conflict of interest, or other issues using a corporate hotline, which is hosted by an independent third party.

By using an external organization to host the hotline, we ensure that our employees feel secure their reports will be anonymous.

We have a strict no retaliation policy regarding good faith reports of activities that run counter to our ethical expectations.

To support employee advancement, we provide on the job training through coaching, feedback, and role modeling.

We encourage internal mobility through career expos and coaching, as well as foster mentorship connections and provide trained coaches as additional developmental support.

Our strong partnerships with internal community resource groups allow us to personalize programs to address specific career development needs.

We are committed to providing equitable opportunities for advancement to all employees and achieving promotion parity across dimensions of gender, race, and ethnicity.

Women continue to be promoted at an approximately equal rate to men, 16.8% compared to 15.7%.

We engaged a third party to analyze promotion activity in 2020 and 2021.

The review analyzed the actual and expected rates of promotions, as well as time to promotion, by gender, race, and ethnicity.

While this initial review yielded differences between actual and expected promotion rates, it was not statistically significant.

If the review were to identify an issue of statistically significant promotion disparity, we would take corrective action.

Our Health and Safety (H S) team oversees workplace conditions for NVIDIANs globally.

We helped form a public private consortium in Southern California with the CEO Leadership Alliance of Orange County and Chapman university.

In FY22, we contributed an 8 petaflops NVIDIA DgX 2 POD to the consortium.

It is the first ever community governed AI supercomputer in the world and uniquely dedicated to local AI talent development, with a priority focus on historically underserved communities.

At gTC in November 2021, we hosted a fireside chat with Mark Andrijani from Slovenia’s Ministry of Digitalization to discuss how countries need to invest in AI, including infrastructure and data scientists.

We have a variety of customers, from large businesses to individual consumers.

With so many needs to meet, we view our commitment to positive customer relations in terms of the role we play as a responsible supplier, our commitment to our reseller partners and their customers, and to our direct customers.

We offer support to our customers through a comprehensive support site and several NVIDIA hosted product forums and communities.

Our customer service team tracks interactions with consumers as they occur and shares biweekly satisfaction reports internally.

We measure customer satisfaction in several ways, including customer satisfaction rate, percentage of support incidents filed, closed incident survey response rate, and referral rate.

We use these metrics to help create experiences that satisfy and delight our customers.

Our support organization aims to dramatically reduce the time it takes for our software team to incorporate customer feedback, enabling technicians to respond quickly and increase customer satisfaction.

We also use data gathered from our customer forums to give our research and development organizations feedback about what’s working and what improvements our customers want.

In addition to the functions listed above, we provide support through account management, solutions architects, and developer relations, training, and conferences.

Our customers include some of the world’s largest electronics, consumer brand, and automotive companies.

Consequently, we’ve integrated the standards outlined in the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct covering labor, environment, health and safety, ethics, and management systems throughout our global operations.

We use these standards as our management approach for our supply chain.

Our customer support organization is on the front line of communications with our partners, working with their engineering teams as they test NVIDIA products in their systems and devices.

Inquiries from our original equipment manufacturer partners have increased in line with our focus on supplier responsibility and environmental sustainability.

Requests for information relate to business continuity, conflict minerals, environmental compliance, product quality, safety compliance, cybersecurity, consumer satisfaction, and ethics.

To manage these inquiries and requests, we employ quarterly business reviews with key customers, and partner with them on various initiatives through the RBA.

Some customers assign points on their scorecards for environmental, social, and governance performance.

Customers who are RBA members monitor our performance through tools provided by that organization, such as the RBA Online platform, RBA self assessment questionnaires, the Validated Assessment Program, and tracking tools for carbon, water, and waste.

We also participate in the RBA environmental sustainability workgroup and complete the online environmental survey on carbon, water, and waste.

In addition to the RBA Environmental Survey, we participate in the CDP climate change and water surveys each year.

Participants are scored based on their understanding and management of their business risks, opportunities, and impacts related to climate change and water resources.

We maintain Full Material Disclosures (FMD) for our chip designs and select system products.

NVIDIA is required to report material information through various platforms, including Substances of Concern in Products and International Material Data System for automotive.

We have expanded our FMD program to include more products in FY22.

The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) program independently verifies the environmental impact of electronic products and is used by thousands of private and public institutional purchasers around the world to make sustainable IT procurement decisions.

All NVIDIA chips and graphic cards support EPEAT conformance, and we provide information to customers seeking to register their products with the program.

Our information security practices comprise the measures we design to protect networks, computers, programs, and data from unauthorized access or attack, as well as measures designed to protect NVIDIA’s products and the privacy of our customers’ and employees’ data.

As we monitor security attacks against us and others and become aware of more frequent high profile security breaches, we remain committed to implementing vigorous protections for any personal information we collect.

Our efforts are managed by a global team of cybersecurity, IT, engineering, operations, and legal experts.

A cybersecurity committee, driven by executive level leaders, meets monthly to review metrics and evaluate emerging threats.

To ensure a robust breadth of knowledge, the team consults with external parties, such as computer security firms and risk management and governance experts.

We follow the processes to ensure information security management outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001 for Information Security Standards.

We address cybersecurity scenarios in our resilience planning, document them through business continuity plans, and test the reliability of our products and our ability to respond to threats through attack simulations.

Against the backdrop of frequent changes and fresh insights, we continually evaluate and evolve our security measures.

In the event of a cybersecurity issue, we’ve prescribed a set of actions for teams to initiate that will help us to determine the type and rigorousness of our response.

Information security cybersecurity awareness training is available on demand to all employees, and we hold regular live trainings.

Our IT team has implemented extensive training internally on the risks of phishing scam emails.

This includes sending simulated attack emails to all employees to test their awareness.

NVIDIA Security Bulletins and Notices are published on our website.

The NVIDIA Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is a global team that manages the receipt, investigation, internal coordination, remediation, and disclosure of security vulnerability information related to NVIDIA products and services.

PSIRT’s goal is to minimize the risk to customers associated with security vulnerabilities by providing timely information, guidance, and remediation of vulnerabilities in our products and services.

The PSIRT team integrates elements of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and controls into its security program.

We participate in the global Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST.org), contribute to FIRST.org Special Interest groups (SIgs) to make improvements to PSIRT processes, and share process knowledge with others so they may implement this type of notification and security work within their own organizations.

We also participate in MITRE’s Cybersecurity and Vulnerability Exposure Number Authority Coordination Working group and partner with third party research institutions and corporate peers to extend the MITRE ATT CK framework for AI to advance the industry’s security and its response to new and upcoming threats.

NVIDIA’s Shawn Richardson sits on the Board of Directors of the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams for the 2020 2022 term.

Her oversight responsibilities include diversity and inclusion initiatives and Liaison for SIgs to collaborate, share ideas, and occasionally produce training, standards, frameworks, and documentation.

We hold ourselves and our suppliers to the highest standards of behavior, and only engage suppliers that share our values.

We closely manage our supply chain to deliver innovative products that satisfy our customers’ expectations in a socially and environmentally conscious manner.

We have been Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) members since 2007 and in 2018 were accepted as Full Member.

From the beginning, we adopted the RBA Code of Conduct and integrated its elements into our processes, including auditing strategic suppliers and conducting internal assessments to confirm that we are addressing all aspects of responsible supply chain management.

We do not directly manufacture the semiconductor wafers or printed circuit boards used in our products, nor do we manufacture our branded devices.

Instead, we partner with world class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging.

We also contract with manufacturers to build, test, and distribute our branded devices.

We utilize industry leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers.

Our two main contract manufacturers for company or partner branded devices are BYD Auto Co. Ltd. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (Foxconn).

Policies and practices governing supplier management, environmental and social impacts, and responsible sourcing of materials in the supply chain.

Participation in industry organizations and engagement with suppliers.

Supplier audits to ensure compliance with standards and requirements.

Protection of human rights throughout the supply chain.

All our manufacturing suppliers are required to comply with the RBA Code of Conduct and associated NVIDIA policies, including an Agreement for Manufacturer Environmental Compliance.

We also encourage them to use the RBA Code as a platform to go above and beyond compliance.

Our assessment process involves using the RBA online system to evaluate existing and potential new suppliers against product compliance industry standards, social and environmental criteria, use of conflict minerals, the RBA Code, and NVIDIA’s code of conduct.

We use the results of our assessment process, along with a spending analysis, to rank suppliers to determine their overall risk.

Strategic suppliers include those who produce or handle NVIDIA production materials, those for whom we closely manage quality requirements (non critical suppliers), those who design our branded products, and those who we’re required to work with based on customer agreements.

For strategic suppliers, agreements are deployed and tracked through a quarterly business review (QBR) process to make certain that they uphold our requirements.

QBR performance influences our business allocation decisions.

Each quarter, we review overall supplier assessment by product category and rank performance.

Five of 100 QBR points are allocated to environmental or social performance, and requirements vary by quarter.

Suppliers are required to meet industry compliance requirements as well as NVIDIA requirements.

We’ve assessed and adjusted business with suppliers who don’t comply with minimum requirements.

In FY20, we reviewed all strategic suppliers against NVIDIA cybersecurity requirements, and in FY21, we performed a more in depth assessment of higher risk suppliers.

We looked at our suppliers’ conformance to ISO 27001, ISO 28001, and C TPAT standards, and evaluated them for additional information, product, and physical security requirements.

Depending on the results of the assessment, we require additional evidence of conformance or an improvement plan if gaps are discovered.

We began using Bitsight in FY22 to provide continuous monitoring of cybersecurity risks in our supply chain.

Suppliers are reviewed on a variety of topics and receive a low , moderate , or high risk rating, which we then use to implement improvements.

Moving forward, we plan to continue periodic assessments and continuous monitoring.

NVIDIA’s SAQ review determined that there were no suppliers rated as high risk in our top spending area.

We acknowledge that suppliers may be moderate or high risk even if their SAQ score comes back as low risk.

To mitigate this, we exceed the RBA’s requirement and audit suppliers to validate their risk.

This process revealed one strategic supplier as high risk.

We work with high and moderate risk suppliers to review their CAPs and complete a Closure Audit when necessary.

We reviewed VAP audits in FY22 on 70% of our strategic suppliers, bringing total audits in the past two years to 93%.

We reviewed an additional 25 VAP audits from suppliers we paid more than 1 million in FY22.

We continue to go above and beyond RBA member requirements by engaging 20 suppliers on their CAPs from the FY22 auditing season.

Common findings include issues related to occupational safety, emergency preparedness, working hours, freely chosen employment, and wages and benefits.

We continue monitoring to ensure that suppliers demonstrate effective processes to ensure compliance.

Specific actions on non compliance issues vary depending on the type of finding and supplier.

We require compliance to all elements of the RBA code and work with suppliers to close all CAPs.

NVIDIA’s Code of Conduct contains requirements around human rights.

We tracked supplier working hours through VAP, CAPs, or RBA working hours templates.

We are in alignment with the uN guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the uN universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Relevant NVIDIA employees took several RBA Learning Academy courses.

We participated in the RBA’s Responsible Labor Initiative.

We worked with suppliers to ensure their compliance with the principles of zero hiring fees and freely chosen employment.

When violations are discovered, we require suppliers to return hiring fees to workers.

We assigned Learning Academy courses to 11 suppliers: Hours of Work, Working Hours Recording System, Working Hours Management System, The Hiring Process, Recruitment and Selection, Hiring and Working with Migrant Workers, Wages and Benefits, Creating Motivating Wage Systems, and Improving Your Dormitories.

Health and Safety We updated environmental, health, safety, and energy policies.

We assigned Learning Academy courses to 11 suppliers: Effective H S Systems, Fire Safety, and Managing Air Emissions.

We continued membership in the Responsible Minerals Initiative and participated in its work groups on due diligence data collection and smelter engagement.

See Responsible Sourcing for information about our efforts to source conflict free minerals.

We assigned Learning Academy courses to 11 suppliers: Supply Chain Ethics, Recognizing Forced Labor, and Preventing Forced Labor.

We reviewed suppliers’ environmental improvement plans for ISO 14001 alignment.

We completed the RBA online environmental survey on carbon, water, and waste.

We participated in the RBA environmental sustainability work group.

We assigned Learning Academy courses to 11 suppliers: Environmental Protection, Managing Energy and gHg Emissions, Water and Wastewater Management, Resolving Wastewater Treatment Issues, and Managing Waste.

We conducted quarterly business reviews of suppliers.

We assessed compliance with the updated RBA Code with respect to labor fees and freedom of association.

We assigned Learning Academy courses to 11 suppliers: understanding Supply Chain Responsibility, Industry Standards, Responsible Supply Chain Management (for Factory Management), Supply Chain CSR Monitoring, and using KPIs.

We define human rights as the fundamental rights, freedoms and standards of treatment belonging to all humans.

We seek to promote human rights throughout our supply chain.

We expect our suppliers to respect human rights whenever they provide products or services for us.

We expect our suppliers to maintain progressive employment, environmental, health, safety and ethical practices that meet or exceed applicable laws, the RBA Code of Conduct, our CSR Directive, our Code of Conduct and our Human Rights Policy.

We also encourage suppliers to use the RBA Code as a platform to go above and beyond compliance.

We monitor our supply chain through the RBA’s Validated Assessment Program and work directly with suppliers to implement any corrective actions.

We seek to use in our products gold, tantalum, tungsten, and tin from conflict free sources, as explained in more detail in Responsible Sourcing and our Responsible Minerals Policy.

In our supply chain, we protect worker rights while promoting business continuity.

As members of the RBA, we follow the RBA process to better understand the impact of COVID 19 on our supply chain.

We’ve continued to monitor the impact of COVID 19 on our supply chain and on workers’ hours and wages through questionnaires and audit results.

We take the issue of forced labor very seriously and conduct regular audits to ensure all workers in our supply chain are treated with respect and dignity.

Our supplier audits have never identified incidents of forced uyghur labor, but we recognize that the risk exists.

To help eliminate forced labor from global supply chains, we are full members of and work with industry groups like the RBA.

The RBA and NVIDIA allow for certain exemptions to working hours requirements in the case of emergency or other unusual situations, and we have identified the virus outbreak, and subsequent government shutdown of activities across the globe, as such.

Strategic suppliers have communicated any reporting or auditing delays, including VAP audits and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) renewal audits.

We continue to work with them and are applying guidance in accordance with the RBA, while remaining in conformance with its code of conduct.

The RBA has also launched a Remote VAP audit option for qualifying facilities, and we utilize that where possible and applicable to keep our suppliers on their normal audit cycle.

We support, contribute to, and rely on industry wide efforts to validate the source of minerals used in our products, ensuring that they come from socially responsible sources and do not contribute to human conflict.

Our goal is to use only conflict free gold, tantalum, tungsten, and tin (3Tg) in our products, and to achieve 100% Responsible Minerals Assurance Process compliant tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold processing facilities (approximately 90%).

We share an annual update in our Conflict Minerals Report, which can be found on our website.

We’ve successfully removed non compliant 3Tg smelters and refiners in our supply chain to help us meet this goal.

We’re a member of the Public Private Alliance (PPA) for Responsible Minerals Trade and the RBA’s Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI).

The PPA provides funding and coordination support to organizations working within the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjacent countries to develop verifiable conflict free supply chains, align due diligence programs and practices, encourage responsible sourcing from the region, promote transparency, and bolster in region civil society and governmental capacity.

We support these on the ground programs aimed at improving transparency for responsible sourcing and reducing human rights risks, including forced labor.

Our due diligence program regarding conflict materials conforms in all material respects with the framework recommended by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

Our Responsible Minerals Policy, sourcing goals, and the steps we take to monitor our supply chain for conflict minerals is framed around the OECD Due Diligence guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict Affected and High Risk Areas.

This guidance provides detailed recommendations to help companies respect human rights and avoid contributing to conflict through their mineral purchasing decisions and practices.

Our due diligence program regarding conflict materials conforms in all material respects with the framework recommended by the OECD.

We continue to evaluate smelter metrics for annual SEC conflict minerals reporting requirements, and we remove or deactivate suppliers that are non compliant with product and conflict mineral requirements.

During the reporting period, 100% of our suppliers and component manufacturers responded with the requested information.

We monitor additional legal requirements, including the Eu Conflict Minerals Regulations, to determine any future requirements for conflict materials and high risk regions of the world.

In FY20, as the RMI program matured, we began to investigate cobalt in our supply chain.

In FY22 we sent surveys to 100% of our strategic suppliers to collect cobalt smelter data.

We’ve reported the initial results to customers, as requested.

The cobalt program through the RMI is still new and most cobalt refiners in the world have yet to be identified and audited.

As the program matures, our goal is to only source from conflict free cobalt refiners.

Additionally, at the end of 2022, the RMI published the Extended Minerals Reporting Template (EMRT) to be used for non 3Tg minerals like cobalt.

Mica was added to the scope of the EMRT, and we plan to survey our supply chain for both cobalt and mica in 2022.

Our perspective on the importance of diversity extends beyond our own employees and recruits to our indirect supply chain.

We’ve taken steps to better understand the diversity of our vendors in the united States and are working to educate those who make purchasing decisions to include minority owned businesses in the vendor selection process.

AI represents the most profound technological shift in our era, touching virtually every industry, including robotics, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, transportation, retail, and customer service.

ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

Improving the representation of women and other underrepresented communities in technology requires a long term perspective, so we support opportunities that provide youth access to STEM and AI education.

These efforts are designed to inspire students through our technology, engage them directly with NVIDIA engineers, and encourage innovation through hands on activities.

In FY22, we announced a three year partnership with the Boys girls Clubs of Western Pennsylvania to expand access to AI and robotics education to students in traditionally underrepresented communities.

Core to this effort is the development of the AI Pathways Toolkit, an open source curriculum supported by staff tools and training, which will make it easy for Boys girls Clubs nationwide and other education focused organizations to deliver AI curriculum to their students.

We helped fund the AI Education Project, which provides evidence based, culturally relevant AI curricular resources and educator training to schools and other education partners.

This investment will help it scale the impact of its introductory AI curriculum to 10,000 more K 12, community college, and HBCu students across the united States.

And we supported the Teens in AI Ada Lovelace Hackathon, which brings together young people, particularly young women, across the world to learn about AI and develop the skills needed to drive innovation.

Participants had the opportunity to hear from NVIDIA employees, who served as mentors and judges, and to get access to NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute credits for more advanced hands on training.

We promoted opportunities for NVIDIANs to serve as virtual mentors for longtime partner Technovation’s global competition for girls to use technology to solve problems in their community.

And NVIDIANs volunteered as tutors in areas such as math and science with nonprofit uPchieve.

Other virtual volunteer activities included a department team building event with Suitup, during which employees served as coaches for an AI focused student business competition and a community event with NVIDIA’s Hispanic Latino Network (HLN) community resource group to create STEAM kits for children in foster care.

Additionally, we supported organizations like Black girls Code, girls Who Code, great Minds in STEM, and Techbridge girls through our matching gifts program and a fundraiser organized by HLN.

We are committed to diversity, inclusion, and representation of developers in our ecosystem.

We aim to expand the pipeline of university and professional AI developers by engaging various communities traditionally underrepresented in technology via partnerships to effect workforce development, training, and mentorship opportunities.

Our partners include professional organizations Women in Data, Women ai, and Black Women in AI.

We continuously engage computer science departments at Historically Black Colleges and universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions across the united States, providing complimentary passes for our conferences and trainings from our Deep Learning Institute, as well as curriculum and technology resources.

CEO Jensen Huang gave the closing keynote at AI4ALL’s event on bringing diversity to AI and the industries using AI to make life changing decisions.

Our NVIDIA gTC events are an opportunity to extend our inclusion efforts to partners, institutions, and developers.

Due to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic, we hosted gTC online, enabling access by even more developers.

In FY22, we hosted sessions at gTC on diversity and inclusion in AI, including a conversation about initiatives to help young people understand AI and a panel on the value that underrepresented groups can provide.

With over 3 million developers in the NVIDIA ecosystem, we aim to strengthen developer representation from emerging markets through our Emerging Chapters program.

At the heart of this program, we support local developers and technology communities in emerging markets to build and scale their AI ML, data science, and graphics projects.

It also trains students and developers in industry readiness technical skills and continues to nurture them.

Through this effort, we are helping to mend what’s called the technology fracture the gap between developers in the global North and those in emerging markets.

Members of Emerging Chapters have access to training and development opportunities through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI).

This includes free passes for self or instructor led courses on AI, graphics, video analytics, and data science.

Africa alone has seen a doubling in DLI trainings.

To bridge the compute divide and fuel local innovation, we continue to enable more Emerging Chapter community members and research universities with gPu grants.

In FY22, more than 30 African developer community groups including seven founded by women joined Emerging Chapters.

Our goal is for the program to continue to build in Africa and expand to Latin America, the Middle East, Turkey, South Asia, and other emerging markets.

At our gTC Fall conference, we reached over 40,000 developers in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.

Emerging Chapters members spoke to a global audience on topics such as how to bridge the AI education gap, using AI to build innovations that address local challenges, and the AI revolution.

Improving performance and energy efficiency is a principal goal in each step of our research, development, and design processes.

We aim to make every new generation of gPus faster and more energy efficient than its predecessor.

And our technology is driving some of the most important advances for modeling our climate, reducing carbon emissions, and designing mitigation and adaptation strategies in a changing world.

AI is revolutionizing scientific computing, and our platform enables modern data centers to accelerate increasingly common deep learning, machine learning, and high performance computing (HPC) workloads.

As a result, sequential calculations are performed in the CPu while the more complicated matrix calculations are computed in parallel in the gPu, consuming less power than the equivalent, traditional computational forms relying on CPus.

We aim to make every generation of gPus faster and more energy efficient than its predecessor.

NVIDIA Ampere architecture is up to 20x faster for AI training and inference and up to 7.5x more energy efficient than its previous generation.

Energy efficiency considerations built into product design.

Energy efficiency and performance improvements of each new generation of products.

Software and networking to optimize energy efficiency and performance.

Applications of NVIDIA technology for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

We estimate the world could save nearly 12 trillion watt hours of energy a year by switching accelerated computing workloads from CPu only servers to gPu accelerated systems.

Our Hopper gPu architecture, announced in March 2022, is up to 30x faster for AI inference and up to 3.5x more energy efficient than NVIDIA Ampere architecture, which it succeeds.

We put trained models to work in live applications run by millions of hyperscale servers worldwide.

Our TensorRT inference software helps even the largest neural networks run across a broad range of data center, embedded, and automotive applications in real time.

The MLPerf consortium provides an industry benchmark for AI performance and energy efficiency on scientific applications in HPC.

In its debut, our Orin system on chip based on NVIDIA Ampere architecture set new records in AI inference and led in five of six performance tests.

Along with our partners, we continue to show leading performance across all tests and scenarios in the MLPerf inference round.

Energy efficiency is critical as AI models and HPC applications increase exponentially in size.

By moving to new generation gPus, our customers complete their work with lower energy consumption and get results back more quickly.

Individual gPus typically have a higher peak active power consumption than CPus, but also complete workloads dramatically faster, so they return to low power idle states quickly and thus consume far less overall energy.

NVIDIA gPus are typically 20x more energy efficient for certain AI and HPC workloads than CPus.

If we switched accelerated computing workloads from CPu only servers worldwide to gPu accelerated systems, we estimate the world could save nearly 12 trillion watt hours of energy a year, equivalent to the electricity requirements of nearly 1.7 million u.S. homes.

Processing capabilities have grown exponentially in the past decade fueled largely by supercomputers, data centers and cloud computing.

With the fully developed end to end hardware and software stack, the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform is the engine of the modern data center.

NVIDIA powers 23 of the top 30 supercomputers on the June 2022 green500 list.

A hyperscale data center with NVIDIA gPus takes up 1 47th of the rack space of the CPu based systems that it replaces and runs at 93% lower energy cost for AI models.

We develop hardware, software, and networking technology to improve performance and energy efficiency in the data center.

We provide customers insight into server level power efficiency to enable users to run workloads with an optimal balance of performance and power efficiency.

Software can significantly improve energy efficiency of AI workloads.

We’re continuously optimizing our CUDA X libraries and GPU accelerated applications, so it’s not unusual for users to see an x factor performance gain on the same gPu architecture.

AI workloads on NVIDIA Ampere architecture improved by 2.5x over the past two years.

We offer the latest versions of AI and HPC software from the NVIDIA gPu Cloud (NgC) to help users run applications at higher performance on their supercomputer, in the data center, or in the cloud.

We estimate energy savings of 20% on NgC workloads because of users implementing performance suggestions from tools like Pytorch Performance Linter, which optimize models and input output pipelines.

As supercomputers take on more workloads across data analytics, AI, simulation and visualization, CPus are stretched to support a growing number of communication tasks needed to operate large and complex systems.

Data processing units (DPUs), which move data around the data center, alleviate 30% or more of this stress by offloading some of these processes from the CPu.

Certain workloads achieve more than 50x performance improvement, allowing fewer servers to be deployed and reducing power of a modest datacenter by 4MW.

The zero trust protection platform enabled by NVIDIA DPus brings a new level of security to data centers at speeds up to 600x faster than servers without NVIDIA accelerations, again reducing infrastructure and power.

Built for AI, the NVIDIA Spectrum 4 Ethernet switch enables extreme networking performance and robust security with 40% lower power consumption compared to the previous generation.

Adequate cooling is required to optimize supercomputer performance.

We deploy state of the art technology designed for NVIDIA server products, using computational fluid dynamics models to enhance cooling for data center designs and server rack deployments.

Cooling solutions are closely coupled with server racks to localize and optimize heat transfer.

We share our data center best practices with customers and partners to help optimize their deployments.

In partnership with leading storage and networking technology providers, we offer a portfolio of reference architectures for optimal and efficient deployment of our DgX server products, and we make these publicly available on our corporate website.

Max Q is a system design approach that enables thin and light gaming laptops to deliver high performance with optimal efficiency.

Every component and element of the laptop from gPu, CPu, and software to PCB design, power delivery, and thermals is optimized for power efficiency and performance.

Dynamic Boost 2.0 uses AI to balance power among the CPu, gPu, and gPu memory, reducing power consumption by about 20 25%.

It is available on all geForce RTX 30 Series Max Q laptops and is enabled out of the box, helping maximize performance in every app and game.

Desktop class geForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards offer up to 2x the performance and 1.9x the power efficiency over the previous generation.

Climate scientists in government labs and universities have long used gPus to model climate scenarios and predict weather patterns.

With recent advances in AI, modeling of weather forecasting can now be done 4 5 magnitudes faster than by using traditional methods.

We announced plans to build Earth 2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change.

The system will build a digital twin of the Earth on Omniverse, enabling scientists to do ultra high resolution climate modeling and put mitigation and adaptation tools into the hands of cities and nations so they can act with more urgency.

In the commercial sector, AI driven power grid operations and next generation smart meters are enabling utilities to accelerate the world’s energy transition.

Our Omniverse platform is being used to simulate digital twins that predict costly maintenance at power plants and model new energy sources such as fusion reactor design.

AI Nations is NVIDIA’s global effort to democratize AI by supporting governments and related stakeholders in developing plans to implement AI strategies that advance national priorities and drive economic growth.

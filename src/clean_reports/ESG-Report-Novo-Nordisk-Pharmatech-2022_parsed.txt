Here at Novo Nordisk Pharmatech, we are committed to being a sustainable business.

To us, this means that we add value to society and our future business in an environmentally friendly way.

To achieve this ambition, we strive to do business in a financially, environmental, and socially responsible way.

Therefore, we look at our performance and set specific targets within the ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) areas .

To us environmental impact does not only include CO2e emissions, but also other activities that impact the environment.

CO2e emissions from operations and transportation.

We acknowledge that CO2e emissions continue to rise and pose one of the biggest environmental issues: the climate crisis.

That’s why we have committed to having net zero emissions across our entire value chain by 2045.

To us net zero means gaining carbon neutrality by reducing our emissions as close to zero as possible and ensuring any remaining emissions are reabsorbed from the atmosphere.

Since 2018 all our electricity and gas consumption comes from renewable resources, but we are actively working on reducing our consumption and phasing out gas.

The process of establishing additional energy and water meters to get more detailed data as a foundation for optimisations.

Replacement of our last gas furnaces with heat pumps and a heat exchanger.

Our operation results in CO2e emissions1 from materials used in our manufacturing processes, handling of our hazardous waste and distribution of products.

For us this include emissions from combustion of diesel for our emergency generators, emissions from company owned vehicles and emissions from chemicals in our process equipment.

Gas (100% renewable biogas) heat and steam for own production.

Since 2018, our heat and steam are generated from renewable electricity, thus we do not have any emissions within this scope.

Scope 3 includes other indirect emissions related to the value chain.

Scope 3 emissions can come from upstream and downstream activities.

Non hazardous waste handling non hazardous waste from operation and emissions from direct supply.

Emissions from transportation is also included, although it is currently only possible for us to report on emissions from transportation of direct supply.

Table 1 shows our CO2e emissions within the three scopes.

Graph 2 shows the reduction mainly comes from a decrease in emissions from business flights, where COVID 19 taught us new ways of working online, which we continue to incorporate into our daily working practices.

Furthermore, we have seen a decrease in emissions from hazardous waste handling.

We had a small increase in the number of leaks of substances and refrigerants with a GWP potential in 2022 and we aim to phase out all refrigerants with a high GWP potential.

To achieve our goal of having net zero emissions across our value chain by 2045, high focus on and collaboration with our suppliers is crucial.

Our target is that all direct suppliers use 100% renewable energy by 2030.

Therefore, in 2022 we have collaborated with some of our biggest suppliers to ensure a conversion to using 100% renewable energy.

Handling of hazardous waste from operation accounts for the second highest portion of our total emissions.

In 2022 we initiated a project for the regeneration of one of our biggest hazardous waste fractions.

The aim is to establish our own regeneration, which we estimate can reduce our total emissions by up to 60%.

In addition to our work with Circular for Zero, Novo Nordisk Pharmatech has purchased 1 hectare of land from Klimaskovfonden, which will be established as a forest in the beginning of 2023.

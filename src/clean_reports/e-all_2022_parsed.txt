In 2022, the Workshop identi ed 11 transition and physical climate risks and eight opportunities.

The top three climate risks were net zero emissions, impact on company reputation, and uncertainties in the development of new energy saving carbon reduction technologies, and the top three opportunities were: develop low carbon products and services and increase energy e ciency in customer products, drive low carbon manufacturing, and boost company reputation.

Apart from continuous improvements on carbon reduction practices, TSMC also set up carbon credit procurement strategies and started implementations in 2022 to further enhance corporate climate resilience.

See TSMC TCFD Report for qualitative assessment methods and results on the nancial impacts of each risk and opportunity.

Stick to green manufacturing and green innovation.

The annual GHG inventory result is TSMC's rst step to strengthening carbon reduction by reviewing overall carbon reduction e orts and revising the emission reduction strategies on a rolling basis.

In 2022, the Company's total GHG emission was 18 million MT CO2 equivalent direct emissions from Scope 1 processes such as F GHGs and nitrous oxide processes accounted for 11% indirect GHG emissions in Scope 2 from electricity use, which was still the major emission source, accounted for 50% and indirect GHG emissions from the value chain in Scope 3 accounted for 39%, which were primarily from producing raw materials, energy related activities in the upstream, and transportation.

TSMC continues to enforce industry leading best practices for GHG reduction, including ramping up replacements and installing local scrubbers on the manufacturing end, using carbon neutral natural gases, constructing green factories with green building certi cates, implementing energy saving projects for process tools and facility equipment, and increasing the use of renewable energy.

In response to an increase in carbon cost brought about by a global trend in low carbon transition, starting from 2022, TSMC widely uses internal carbon pricing mechanism to re ect carbon cost in e cacy estimation for daily reduction measures, and include this into decision making evaluation for new fab investments.

As for emissions reduction actions in Scope 3, TSMC continues to focus on increasing material use e ciency and implement electronic grade chemical reuse.

Total emission on low carbon transition and their own carbon hot spots, and helps them develop strategy and target on carbon reduction.

TSMC also shares with suppliers its Best Known Method to support them to implement green actions together.

Note 4: Emission factor based on data released in 2022 by the Bureau of Energy stating that 0.509 kg of CO2e kWh, where 1 kg of CO2e equals 6,805 kJ.

TSMC is committed to reducing carbon footprints in raw material manufacturing and transportation to product manufacturing, testing, and assembling phases.

In 2022, the Company obtained ISO 14067 third party certi cation, and conduct Product Carbon Footprint Assessment every three years.

Other than actively reducing greenhouse gas emissions in manufacturing processes and improving resource e ciency, the Company also o ers guidance for suppliers to join its consistent endeavors in realizing environmental sustainability.

In addition, although the life cycle of TSMC's product carbon footprint covers from raw material excavation to shipment, through providing highly energy e cient process technology, TSMC supported clients in increasing the life span and function innovation of terminal smart devices applied in various elds, including developing smart home, smart city, smart health care, smart industry.

This further helps save energy for the world, as every kWh of power used in production can help save four kWh of power for other industries worldwide and households.

Increasing the use of renewable energy is critical to achieving the Company's goal of Net Zero Emissions by 2050.

In 2022, with support from the board and management team, TSMC introduced renewable energy from small hydroelectric stations, continued to increase power supply from onshore wind farms, increased renewable energy usage by 47% to 970 GWh, and maintained 100% use of renewable energy in global o ces.

TSMC also signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) for 1.3 GW of renewable energy with the option to increase around 3,900 GWh of green energy each year.

By the end of 2022, the Company has signed on 2.9 GW of renewable energy through PPAs, which can reduce around 4.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions each year.

In addition, TSMC has been purchasing renewable energy, Renewable Energy Certi cates (RECs), and carbon credits in countries with comprehensive regulations and ample supply to o set 100% of carbon emissions from power used in overseas locations, including the United States, Canada, Europe, China, Japan, and Korea.

Promote diversi cation of renewable energy sources.

In addition to purchasing renewable energy, TSMC has also installed solar panels in TSMC facilities to produce carbon free renewable energy for its own fabs.

In 2022, TSMC had an installed capacity of 5,340 kWp in solar panels, which provided 4.56 GWh in electricity and reduced carbon emissions by 2,322 metric tons.

In 2023, an additional 900 kW of solar panel capacity will be installed, which can generate up to 4.6 GWh of electricity.

While strengthening its own climate resilience, the Company is also expanding the scope of e orts toward sustainability and common good through TSMC Charity Foundation's Public Welfare Green Energy Project to install photovoltaic (PV) systems and give back all earnings from power rebates to organizations serving disadvantaged communities.

As of 2022, the Company has provided an installed capacity of 464 kWp across seven locations and generated 574,000 kWh in electricity.

In 2022, it also gave back NT 2.75 million from rebates generated by the project.

Semiconductor technologies are evolving rapidly and increasing energy consumption.

In 2022, TSMC consumed a total of 22,400 GWh in energy with purchased electricity accounting for around 94%, natural gases for 5.8%, and diesel for 0.2%.

TSMC is dedicated to optimizing energy use e ciency.

The Energy Saving and Carbon Reduction Committee has de ned ve major energy conservation teams for di erent process technologies to explore opportunities to save energy and maximize energy conservation in tools.

In 2022, TSMC was able to conserve 700 GWh in electricity and successfully increase process energy e ciency for 5nm volume production to 60% in the third year, exceeding the annual target.

In 2022, the ve major energy conservation teams continued to innovate various energy conservation programs, including the Hot Water Recycling System, Intelligent Compressed Dry Air (CDA) Flow Control System, and Optimized AI powered Water Chiller System.

In addition, TSMC is deploying a variety of green action plans to improve energy and resource e ciency.

To strengthen energy conservation and carbon emissions, TSMC founded the Engineering Center for Green Manufacturing in 2022 to comprehensively assess, plan, and manage net zero emission strategies, energy conservation in modules and tools, energy conservation in facility equipment, and low carbon technology R D. Additionally, TSMC integrated energy saving measures across facilities for horizontal roll out, which will become standard designs for new facilities.

Taiwan facilities in energy conservation to generate more green bene ts.

In 2022, TSMC implemented 684 energy conservation measures across eight categories, achieving a 13% energy saving rate and conserving 700 GWh in electricity.

Energy conserved in 2022 is the equivalent of reducing 360,000 metric tons in carbon emissions and saving NT 1.75 billion in energy costs.

The reduced carbon emissions also decreased the potential social cost of carbon by NT 530 million.

As of 2022, the Energy Conservation Action Project for Next generation Fab Tools launched in 2018 has validated and applied 195 energy conservation programs to hundreds types of advanced process tools and conserved 500 GWh in energy through cross fab roll out of energy conservation measures.

TSMC cares about environmental sustainability and actively works to strike a balance between technology and ecology.

To ensure sustainable ecosystems and maintain biodiversity, TSMC regularly assesses changes in ecosystems surrounding TSMC fabs, cultivates indigenous species, created re y habitats within TSMC locations, and launched the TSMC Plant a Tree Program to facilitate stable population growth and reproduction for species.

In addition to implementing eco friendly practices, TSMC is also an avid supporter of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and SDGs.

Biodiversity Statement in 2022, which will be formally declared in 2023.

TSMC's Biodiversity Statement will commit to working with stakeholders to protect and deepen the integrity of biodiversity and working with supply chain partners to raise awareness and comply with related regulations within business locations, ful lling its mission of strengthening environmental protection.

In 2022 Q4, TSMC conducted a Dependencies Impacts on Nature and Biodiversity Assessment for deeper insights into interactions between operations and local environments, analyzing three areas location of facilities, emission of pollutants, and dependency on ecosystem services.

For location of facilities, TSMC overlapped the Company's locations in Taiwan with the Forestry's Bureau National Ecological Network GIS database and included resources consumed and emissions discharged throughout operations as assessment factors to identify mitigation and restoration.

Plant a total of 122,000 trees with TSMC Plant a Tree Program since the start of the program around fabs and enforce environmental education.

In addition, TSMC is working with stakeholders such as the Forestry Bureau, county and city governments, research and education institutes, and conservation groups to promote conservation programs based on conservation corridor assessment results and deepen the diverse values of biodiversity.

For pollutant emissions, TSMC used qualitative analysis of Life Cycle Impact and identi ed GHG emissions as the main cause of impact on biodiversity, followed by water consumption.

TSMC is driving low carbon manufacturing and enforcing GHG reduction standard practices to e ectively reduce GHG emissions per unit of production.

The Company also complies with AWS Standards to enforce sustainable water management at all TSMC fabs and improves surrounding ecosystems and soil and water conservation to foster biodiversity.

For dependency on ecosystem services, which was explored for the rst time in 2022, TSMC established a dedicated internal unit and invited outside experts to join in meetings and discussions and also compiled a survey on supplier enforcement.

Results showed that TSMC and its supply chain are more dependent on three types of ecosystem services water provision, climate regulation, and ood prevention.

TSMC will continue to strengthen the climate resilience, promote green and low carbon supply chains, and strengthen management in compliance with the Climate Risk Adaptation Standards to reduce dependency on ecosystem services and mitigate impact on operations from loss of ecosystem services.

TSMC is committed to driving green manufacturing and actively implements energy e ciency innovations.

The Company continues to optimize the energy saving model of water chiller systems through machine learning methods and successfully develops three functions including Single Chiller Compressor Abnormal Energy Consumption Detection, Multi chiller Compressor Operating Load Precision Forecast, and Water Chiller System Pressure Control Optimization to strengthen operational reliability.

TSMC introduced the three functions to Fab 15A in 2022, saving 2 GWh of electricity and reducing 1,000 metric tons of carbon emissions.

In 2023, all TSMC 12 inch wafer fabs in Taiwan will begin to adopt the three functions, which are also listed as standard designs for new plants.

Those initiatives are expected to save 100 GWh of electricity per year and reduce carbon emissions by 50,000 metric tons, bringing TSMC closer to its 2050 sustainability goal of Net Zero Emissions.

TSMC has successfully applied EUV technologies for 3nm volume production, but energy consumption rises with the growing number of EUV tools.

To ensure developments in process technologies do not compromise environmental sustainability, the Company continues to optimize EUV tool parameters and reduce energy consumption per unit of wafer production through big data analysis.

Additionally, TSMC engages suppliers for research to dive deep and uncover opportunities to conserve more energy.

Research has shown that EUV light is transmitted with the help of unique re ective mirrors, which, after bouncing o several mirrors, result in severe energy attenuation.

The multilayer mirror's atness and smoothness determines EUV light re ectivity, so, to increase energy e ciency, TSMC has engaged suppliers to netune mirror fabrication processes and optical structures to optimize atness and smoothness and e ectively improve re ectivity.

EUV light is produced from laser pulses ring 50,000 times per second at a drop of tin.

Vaporized tin often deposits on mirrors to cause fog, which impacts productivity.

The Company then needs to inject hydrogen and tin to produce tin hydride before pulling the multilayer mirror out of the chamber.

After repeated testing with suppliers, TSMC was able to pinpoint the optimal parameters for the number of pumps required for tin vapor removal, e ectively reducing energy consumed by tin vapor pumps.

In 2022, TSMC was able to successfully reduce energy consumption per wafer from EUV tools by 22%, the equivalent of 60 GWh.

TSMC is committed to creating an environmentally and socially responsible business model.

To ful ll the Company's commitment of Net Zero Emissions by 2050, the Corporate Environment Safety Health Division, Finance, Accounting, Legal, Information Technology and Materials Management, and Supply Chain Management Units formed the Carbon Credit Task Force and formulated the Carbon Credits Quality Standards for Voluntary Emissions Reductions in compliance with international guidelines and industry practices to serve as purchasing guidelines.

TSMC assessed carbon credit veri cation standards, year issued, additionality, permanence, and risk management.

Additionally, the Company prioritizes programs that comply with UN SDGs such as Climate, Community Biodiversity (CCB) and the criteria that the source of carbon credits should align with emissions for rigorous quality assurance to extend the scope of TSMC's sustainability impact.

Four Nature based Carbon Credit Programs energy and exhaust gas reduction facilities to maximize emissions reduction.

The remaining carbon emissions are o set, in principle, with carbon credits.

In 2022, TSMC selected four carbon credit programs located in the U.S. and China that comply with the Company's Carbon Credits Quality Standards for Voluntary Emissions Reductions.

The programs are mainly nature based carbon credits from projects that establish natural forests and improve forest management.

Two of the natural forest establishment programs create jobs for local residents and foster skillsets in maintaining the forest 50% of the jobs created are o ered to women to facilitate gender equality.

The remaining two programs improve forest management to uphold local biodiversity and help local conservation groups and indigenous communities preserve traditional cultures and outdoor education through earnings from carbon credits.

Through carbon credit trading, TSMC has been able to not only o set carbon emissions but also ful ll several SDGs to create diverse sustainability bene ts.

Water pollution composite indicator reduction rate of 60% Note 3.

Note 1: In 2022, TSMC newly built Fab 18 Phases 6, 7 8.

Excluding the new facilities, the unit water consumption was 15.6% in 2022.

In the future, facilities below a certain economic scale will be excluded from the calculation of unit water consumption (1) The source of reclaimed water include municipal drainage and industrial discharge (2) Replacement rate of reclaimed water consumption volume of reclaimed water (consumption volume of reclaimed water tap water).

Figures from TSMC fabs in Taiwan In 2022, TSMC was able to reduce the water pollution composite indicator by 54.3%, exceeding the 2022 target of 45% and long term 2030 goal of 50%.

As such, the 2030 goal was changed from 50% to over 60%.

In 2022, Taiwan experienced zero typhoons while weather fronts carrying moisture failed to cover reservoirs in Taiwan, resulting in little rainfall in Southern Taiwan.

Based on the drought monitoring signals issued by the Water Resources Agency, TSMC adopted response measures in compliance with the TSMC Internal Control Procedures for Low Water Supply Crisis Management to take stock of areas where more water could be conserved and to strengthen the water use e ciency of recycling systems.

In 2022, the Company conserved 3.35 million m3 of water and recycled a cumulative total of 215 million m3 of water throughout the year.

While working to increase water reclamation e ciency, TSMC also cares about getting the most use out of every drop of water.

As such, TSMC is actively developing water reclamation technologies.

On September 19, 2022, the TSMC Tainan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant Taiwan's rst privately operated water reclamation plant became operational and started recycling industrial wastewater produced in the Southern Taiwan Science Park into reclaimed water for advanced semiconductor processes, a rst for the global semiconductor industry.

TSMC also continues to work with the government and is planning to complete the Tainan Anping Reclaimed Water Plant in 2023, which is estimated to reclaim 35,000 m3 of water per day for TSMC facilities in the Southern Taiwan Science Park (STSP).

TSMC's goal is to increase the supply of reclaimed water to gradually reduce city water consumption each year.

The Company is also exploring the concept of being water positive in the hope of restoring water resources in the future and upholding sustainable water practices.

Every year, TSMC evaluates the water risk levels of all TSMC facilities using the Water Risk Atlas from the World Resources Institute (WRI).

Results from 2022 were identical to those of 2021: WaferTech was rated as low risk TSMC facilities in Taiwan and VisEra were rated as medium to low risk and TSMC (China) and TSMC (Nanjing) were rated as high and medium to high risk, respectively, due to regional water quality di erences.

In 2022, TSMC added Fab 18B into the water risk evaluation.

While building Fab 18B, TSMC preemptively elevated foundations, installed oodgates, and applied existing recycling systems and wastewater treatment measures to the facility.

By the time Fab 18B became operational, it already possessed outstanding ood protection and process water recycling rate, which enabled it to maximize water resources and mitigate environmental impact.

In 2022, Fab 12A, Fab 12B, and Fab 5 at Hsinchu Science Park and Advanced Backend Fab 3 at Lungtan Science Park obtained Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Platinum certi cation.

All advanced TSMC fabs in Taiwan's three science parks have obtained AWS Platinum certi cation (the highest level available) for three consecutive years, a rst for the global semiconductor industry.

Sustainable water stewardship at TSMC complies with AWS standards.

In 2022, the Company introduced water reclaimed from industrial wastewater to facilities at the STSP for the rst time.

The reclaimed water was gradually supplied to Fab 6, Fab 14, and Fab 18 to reduce city water consumption and achieve the preliminary target toward sustainable water balance.

TSMC's e orts toward good water quality include a new tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) treatment system in Fab 3 to e ectively reduce e uent concentration by 90% 70% copper concentration reduction from e uents discharged by Advanced Backend Fab 3 to improve local creek water quality.

After improving the cooling equipment of the reaction tank and reducing the batch reaction time, in June 2022, the hyfro uoric (HF) acid waste regeneration system in Fab 15B achieved zero treatment outsourcing of the HF acid waste liquid.

The hydro uoric acid waste regeneration system processed a cumulative total of 4,193 metric tons of HF acid waste and produced 1,025 metric tons of cryolite in 2022.

In addition, ecological restoration and soil and water conservation in areas surrounding TSMC facilities are AWS implementation priorities.

TSMC compiled the TSMC Fire y Habitat Management Process to bring back re ies and launched a orestation initiatives.

In 2022, over 1,900 adult re ies appeared across TSMC's three major factories.

The Company also planted 108,000 trees and 320,000 shrubs, expanding a orested areas to 10.1 hectares to create a healthier water environment.

TSMC has created an internal Water Map platform to e ectively manage and gain insights into water used in TSMC facilities.

The Company also continues to track reservoir water levels and install in house water quality and water level monitoring points to monitor water usage, recycled water, wastewater, and domestic water consumption in processes according to the water balance chart.

This forms the basis for integrating water consumption and recycle and reuse mechanisms to calculate recycling discharge rates and allocate water to units that use water.

In 2022, TSMC continued to implement four major water saving measures: reducing facility system water consumption, increasing the wastewater recycling of facilities, improving the water production rate of the system, and decreasing water discharge loss from the system.

The Company conserved 3.35 million m3 of water and yielded a wafer unit water consumption of 137.3 liter per 12 inch equivalent wafer mask layer, a 2.6% reduction from the 140.9 liter per 12 inch equivalent wafer mask layer in 2010, the base year.

Nevertheless, TSMC failed to reach the 2022 target because new facilities built in 2022 were still in risk production stages.

Though the new facilities have not yet reached economic scale, there was still a xed amount of water consumption, which led to a lower water saving rate.

Wastewater discharge was 93.0 liter per 12 inch equivalent wafer mask layer, an 18% increase from last year.

The increase was also caused by the water consumption for risk production in new facilities.

Before the new facilities reach economic scale in production, TSMC will continue to optimize operating parameters for water recycling systems, increase water use e ciency, and reduce wastewater discharge.

TSMC is committed to reducing product water footprint in various stages, including raw material manufacturing and transportation, product manufacturing, testing, and packaging, etc.

The water footprint of products is assessed every three years.

In 2022, the Company obtained third party ISO 14046 certi cation.

In terms of water quality indicators, TSMC and raw material suppliers account for 47% and 53%, respectively.

Water pollutants are mainly suspended solids, metals, and chemical oxygen demand (COD).

In addition to actively reducing water consumption from production processes and discharge of water pollutants, TSMC also helps suppliers to set water conservation targets with the Sustainability Management Self Assessment Questionnaire.

All suppliers are required to adhere to the TSMC Supplier Code of Conduct to manage water use and discharge, while identifying opportunities for water saving and implementing measures.

For more details, please refer to Sustainable Supply Chain in this report.

The year 2022 marked the start of water reclamation at TSMC.

To get the most out of every drop of water, TSMC is actively conserving water from production processes while also developing water reclamation technologies.

To ensure water quality complies with advanced process speci cations and their demands for cleanliness, TSMC works with the government, industry, and academia to develop low energy consumption biological treatment, low energy consumption sludge treatment, high e ciency urea removal process, and other innovative technologies.

The Company also establishes multi layered, real time, and automatic monitoring systems to ensure the quality of reclaimed water supplies.

In September 2022, the TSMC Tainan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant entered into operation as a center for processing, monitoring, and supplying TSMC facilities in the STSP.

As of December 2022, the Reclaimed Water Plant has supplied 380,000 m3 of water reclaimed from industrial wastewater.

To develop diverse water resources, the Water Reclamation Plant in Anping, Tainan, will be completed and enter into operation in 2023.

In 2026, the water supply capacity of the Tainan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant will reach up to 36,000 m3 per day, reducing city water consumption and contributing positively to the surrounding environment.

TSMC is also designing innovative systems to reclaim concentrated wastewater and make waste sludge reusable through waste heat, thereby reducing the discharge of high concentration wastewater.

In 2022, TSMC completed the TSMC Tainan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant and also launched the Hsinchu Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant project to expand the use of reclaimed water.

The Hsinchu Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant is expected to supply 10,000 m3 of water per day in 2025.

With the Hsinchu Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant and reclaimed water provided by the city government, new fabs in the Hsinchu Science Park will use 100% reclaimed water, strengthening TSMC's operational resiliency and ful lling the commitment to achieve sustainable water cycle management.

TSMC continues to advance the performance of water pollution control and treatment processes.

As advanced processes have evolved and increased the use of organic chemicals, TSMC has introduced a membrane bioreactor system to strengthen water pollutant removal.

In 2022, average COD and TMAH concentration levels were reduced to 151.5 ppm and 3.75 ppm, respectively.

Fab 15B introduced rotating packed bed technology in 2022 to further reduce COD levels.

Lab test results showed that 70% of COD levels in water can be reduced.

Note: Figures from TSMC fabs in Taiwan out this technology in 2023.

Due to the increased use of cobalt sulfate, cobalt sulfate treatment systems have also been expanded, which have helped to achieve a 54.3% water pollution composite indicator reduction rate, far exceeding the 2022 target of 45% and 2030 goal of 50%.

As such, the reduction rate goal for 2030 has been raised to over 60% to achieve environmental sustainability.

To classify and treat wastewater, TSMC has developed 38 separation systems based on the composition and concentration of wastewater for treatment, recycling, and reuse.

In the third quarter of 2022, Fab 15B successfully eliminated HF acid waste outsourcing by optimizing the hydro uoric acid waste regeneration system, further perfecting the renewable technologies of local circular economy industries.

TSMC also performed sludge tests, a byproduct of the chemical mechanical polishing process, at the Zero Waste Manufacturing Center, turning sludge into aluminum silicon oxide through dehydration, grinding, and surface modi cation.

The aluminum silicon oxide can then be used as plastic llers for factory use.

As semiconductor technologies continue to evolve, the consumption of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI) increases to treat pollutants in wastewater.

To practice green manufacturing, reduce environmental impacts, and improve the water quality of e uents, TSMC launched the NaOCI reduction project in 2022.

Between pH 5.5 and 6.5, NaOCl turns into hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a strong oxidizing agent approximately 80 times stronger than NaOCl.

TSMC capitalized on HOCI's strong oxidizing properties by adding recycled sulfuric acid to NaOCl with deionized water (DI water).

After optimizing the mixing ratio, it became possible to convert NaOCl to HOCl stably, reducing NaOCI consumption without compromising disinfection and ammonia nitrogen removal.

In 2022, the HOCI conversion system was introduced to Fab 15B for pilot run.

It is estimated that annual NaOCI consumption and carbon emissions can be reduced by 80 metric tons and 10 metric tons, respectively.

The Company will continue to roll out the system in other facilities as it is friendlier for the environment and can increase the reuse value of waste liquids, promoting environmental sustainability through green innovation.

Note 2: Derived from the general waste (incineration) coe cient (0.737 kg of CO2e kg).

Note 3: TSMC requires waste treatment vendors to at least acquire ISO 14001 or ISO 45001 certi cations as the basis for standardized management.

Waste treatment vendors include waste treatment and recycling vendors.

TSMC is a committed advocate of the circular economy and upholds the management principles of minimizing waste, maximizing resource recycling, and optimizing vendor management in its e orts to develop a comprehensive waste management system.

As the Company continues to develop advanced processes, more raw materials are consumed and more waste is produced.

As such, TSMC strives to achieve resource sustainability through three major strategies: source reduction, circular economy, and audit and guidance.

In 2022, the Company's waste recycling rate reached 96%, and the land ll rate was less than 1% for 13 consecutive years.

TSMC is also working with vendors to deploy renewable technologies that can successfully produce green energy from organic sludge and reuse activated carbon waste in house to create a circular system.

Raw materials for other industries like optoelectronic semiconductor, chemical industries, etc.

Note 2: Outsourced recycling total solid waste in Taiwan facilities are 114,492 metric tons year, and subsidiaries are 6,195 metric tons year.

TSMC is actively practicing green manufacturing and implementing source reduction strategies to minimize waste.

The interdepartmental Waste Management Task Force utilizes the Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) management cycle to set waste reduction goals and improvement plans at the beginning of each year.

The Task Force also leverages the Unit Waste Production Management System to directly manage and control waste production and reduction.

Waste management units convene monthly to track the progress and outcomes of waste reduction measures.

In 2022, TSMC was able to reduce waste by over 20,000 metric tons through 129 projects that reduced chemical use time and quantity, adopted new chemicals, and extended use cycles.

Wafer cleaning processes and their cleanliness levels are important factors impacting yield.

The higher yield demands of advanced processes have increased the use of sulfuric acids (cleaning solvent).

Process, equipment, and facility organizations worked together to improve post wet etching cleaning steps by increasing acid valve speeds for sulfuric peroxide mixture (SPM) cleaning processes by 54%.

In 2022, sulfuric acid waste produced from cleaning each 12 wafer was successfully reduced by 20% without compromising quality.

In 2023, this process will be deployed to all facilities, which is expected to help reduce sulfuric acid waste liquid by 30,000 metric tons in 2024.

Manufacturing Equipment Waste Reduction 20,000 metric tons.

TSMC is committed to carrying out source reduction strategies.

By developing a closed loop cycle to recycle waste for in house use, the Company has been able to reduce resource consumption and minimize environmental impacts.

Activated carbon is used to recycle wastewater at TSMC.

The resulting waste was previously outsourced to waste treatment vendors for treatment.

To ensure the quality of recycled carbon complies with TSMC standards, several parameters were repeatedly tested and veri ed: hardness (loss from abrasions), iodine value (adsorption capabilities), and apparent density (activation levels).

In 2022, TSMC was able to produce recycled activated carbon with adsorption capabilities and use cycles consistent with new activated carbon.

The recycling process will be deployed to all Taiwan fabs in 2023, which will allow the reuse of activated carbon to reduce outsourcing by 6,000 metric tons and generate NT 30 million in green bene ts each year, e ectively growing the Company's circular economy and supporting environmental sustainability.

In addition to source reduction, TSMC is also carrying out circular economy practices to ful ll long term goals for 2030 of outsourcing less than 0.5kg of waste per wafer unit.

Through the Action Plan to Turn Waste into High Value Products, resource recycling equipment were deployed in the Taiwan fabs that were able to increase the recycling of six types of waste liquids into high value products for internal use or sale.

Over 260,000 metric tons of resources were recycled with an in house resource recycling rate of 28%, which was 6% higher than in 2021 and generated NT 1 billion in bene ts.

The central utility plant structure of the Zero Waste Manufacturing Center was completed, which is slated to enter into operation in 2023.

As for the Electronics grade Chemicals Recycling Program, TSMC continues to conduct evaluations and expects to purify waste into electronic grade chemicals for internal use.

The closed loop cycle can reduce operating risks and maximize the value of recycled products.

The Industry Cooperation to Co create Resources Project involves working with vendors from other industries to reduce incineration and land ll rates.

In 2022, TSMC increased recycling rates from 95% to 96% and reduced land ll rates from 0.2% to 0.1%.

To achieve the 2050 goal of net zero emissions and zero waste, TSMC worked with vendors and introduced anaerobic digestion to treat organic sludge, which can then be used to generate green energy.

Power to Change Society able to reuse instead of incinerating plastic waste through four principles: source management, internal and external sorting, innovative technologies, and high value products.

In 2022, TSMC successfully developed garbage bags from 100% recycled materials for internal use.

Other plastic waste was converted into solid fuel and supplied to combined heat and power (CHP) cogeneration plants to reduce coal consumption.

The technology will go live in the fourth quarter of 2022 and be deployed to all facilities in 2023.

Phase 1 and 2 of Fab 12 previously obtained the highest platinum rating for zero waste to land lls (UL 2799), and all Taiwan facilities and subsidiaries will seek to obtain UL 2799 certi cation in 2023 and 2025, respectively, as well.

In addition, as most of TSMC's waste treatment vendors use diesel trucks, TSMC launched the Electric Waste Removal Truck Program in 2022 and started conducting assessments.

It was discovered that electric trucks produce 45% fewer carbon emissions per kilometer than diesel trucks.

The Program is part of the Company's e orts to uphold the TSMC Environmental Policy.

To promote green innovation, TSMC worked with vendors to launch the Anaerobic Digestion of Organic Sludge R D Project, using anaerobic digestion (AD) to treat organic sludge and produce marsh gas, a form of bio energy, for the rst time.

In 2022, the Company led an application to the Hsinchu Science Park Administration and received approval in September to test out AD for organic sludge treatment at Fab 12 Phases 6 and 7.

As of the end of December, the incineration of organic sludge was successfully reduced by 125 metric tons.

Using anaerobic bacteria, it is possible to break down organic sludge through four stages methanogenesis of methane, for power generation.

Each metric ton of organic sludge can generate approximately 2.2 kWh of energy through AD.

The goal is to recycle instead of incinerate 100% of organic sludge in 2024, which reduces outsourced incineration by 6,500 metric tons, increases recycling rates at Taiwan facilities by 1%, and creates a circular system that can help usher in the future of green energy.

To ensure a safe waste clean up system, TSMC established the Supplier Transportation Management White Paper, requiring waste clean up vendors to strengthen systems for waste removal trucks, drivers, processes before during after clean up, and education and training and obtain ISO 45001 certi cation before 2023.

Waste clean up vendors are asked to protect employee health and reduce environmental risks by creating safe workplaces.

As of the end of 2022, 80% of waste clean up vendors have obtained ISO 45001 certi cation.

In the same year, TSMC conducted on site audits of 41 waste clean up vendors, inspected 100% of tank trucks and sludge clean up trucks, and mitigated ten de ciencies.

TSMC believes that corporate growth and environmental protection go hand in hand.

In the rst stage, new vendor selection, an interdisciplinary team of experts conducts document reviews and on site inspections across six dimensions to ensure compliance in waste treatment, facilities, and on site operations.

Approved vendors then enter the second stage, which includes quarterly on site audits to con rm the ow of waste.

In 2022, new assessment items were added on environmental sustainability to two of the eight dimensions evaluated during annual audits, operations management and waste management.

The items added drive vendors to work with TSMC toward a sustainable environment by obtaining ISO certi cations, reducing and taking stock of GHG emissions, committing to carbon neutrality, recycling resources, and implementing smart management.

Lastly, vendors that perform poorly in three dimensions assessed during annual audits are replaced to enforce green practices throughout the supply chain.

In 2022, TSMC conducted on site audits of 58 waste treatment vendors, reaching an audit ratio of 100% and mitigating 106 de ciencies.

The number of de ciencies was reduced by 17% from 2021, and the percentage of Excellent and Good vendors has increased from 36% in 2015 to 80%.

In 2022, another long term KPI was added under the Circular Resource section  increase the percentage of Excellent Good waste treatment vendors to 90% by 2030 to enhance vendor quality and generate greater impacts on sustainability from the supply chain.

Additionally, 84% of waste treatment vendors have obtained ISO 14001 certi cation.

All waste treatment vendors are expected to obtain the certi cation by the end of 2030.

TSMC continues to leverage digital tools to improve the Intelligent Waste Management Procedure with Full Traceability.

In 2022, the EPA invited the Company to the Environmental Regulation Enforcement Corporate Integrity Forum and National Environmental Regulation Enforcement Conference to share how it was able to strengthen management, recycle resources, and reduce risks of illegal disposal by vendors.

By sharing its experiences, TSMC hopes to lead the industry into a sustainable future through digital transformation.

Achieve ISO 14001 certi cation and implement S.W.I.F.T.

Note: TSMC actively invests resources to lower environmental impacts.

TSMC is committed to air pollution control and has adopted the Emission Source Classi cation method and multi phase Best Available Technology (BAT) to enhance the performance of pollution control.

In 2022, Wet Electrostatic Precipitator Scrubber was applied in TSMC process for the rst time, which used high temperature sulfuric acid for cleaning, reducing alkaline gases and particulate matter (PM2.5) by 90% and 91%, respectively.

Air Pollution Control Procedures areas: air pollution monitoring, water quality analysis, and environmental protection in surrounding areas.

In addition, TSMC is conducting veri cations to help facilities quickly identify target pollutants, apply BAT, and introducing E uents and Water Quality Management for Scrubbers to regularly inspect water quality to ensure air pollution control equipment is operating at optimum levels.

In 2022, TSMC was able to meet the annual target for air pollutant emissions per unit of production as well as the annual target for volatile organic gases reduction, continuing to move toward sustainability goals.

Acid, alkaline, and volatile organic gases comprise the majority of air pollutants produced by the semiconductor industry.

TSMC employs two approaches Classi cation and Reduction of Emission from Sources and Strengthened Management of Terminal Prevention Facilities to achieve BAT with this multi phase system and e ectively control air pollutant emissions.

Exhaust gases are separated in the rst stage based on their properties toxic, corrosive, ammable, per uorocarbon greenhouse gases, and acidic alkaline.

The gases are rst introduced to high e ciency local scrubbers that will process highly concentrated pollutants.

The gases with low concentrations will then be sent to central scrubbers, which are terminal prevention facilities, for the second stage of rinsing and neutralization.

Depending on their boiling points, volatile organic gases may be sent to condensation type scrubbers rst and then to zeolite rotor concentrators for adsorption, reducing emissions and improving decontamination results.

As TSMC accelerates the development of advanced process technologies, the New Tool New Chemical Review Committee evaluates the hazard of new processes and chemicals on ESH to prevent added risks of air pollution.

In 2022, the Committee conducted 430 reviews for 198 new tools and 232 new chemicals.

The two stage review enables the Committee to carefully identify optimal separation methods and local scrubbers for new tools and chemicals.

Depending on exhaust gas properties, they are sent to di erent types of local scrubbers thermal, burn, plasma, wet with chemical dosage, adsorption, condensation, and wet for pre treatment.

As TSMC continues to bring in new types of high e ciency local scrubbers, the Company is also working with suppliers to optimize the performances of existing local scrubbers.

In 2022, TSMC applied the wet electrostatic precipitator scrubber in the process which used high temperature sulfuric acid for cleaning in Fab 12B, using corona technologies and wet scrubber method to remove pollutants alkaline gases and PM2.5 at the same time.

Launched in 2021, the three year High e ciency Spray Equipment Upgrade Program to upgrade existing thermal wet scrubber has upgraded 508 scrubbers, with a nish rate of 68% by the end of 2022.

Power to Change Society gases are channeled to central treatment facilities for scrubbing and acid alkali neutralization to remove pollutants.

Exhaust gases from certain wet processes that emit large amounts of acid alkaline gases are sent to a two step scrubbing central scrubber connecting washing tower to increase pollutant adsorption.

To enhance the e ectiveness of central scrubbers, existing facilities installed hydro membranes, changed lters, and added Raschig rings to optimize tower structures and decontamination.

High e ciency Central Scrubbers in new facilities to enhance the overall performance of terminal prevention facilities.

As for volatile organic gas treatment, TSMC continues to carry out the Low e ciency Single Zeolite Rotor Concentrators renew Initiative in existing facilities and install Dual Zeolite Rotor Concentrators in new facilities.

In 2022, all facilities reduced volatile organic gases by 98.9%.

Due to enhanced prevention and control measures, total air pollutant emissions have not increased with the addition of new facilities.

When concentrated gases adsorbed by zeolite rotors enter thermal oxidizers, pyrolysis can remove volatile organic gas pollutants but may also produce the byproduct of nitrous oxide (NOx) pollutants.

In 2022, Fab 18 Phase 7 applied low nitrous oxide burner (low NOx burner) in the volatile organic gas treatment facilities, using Moderate or Intense Low Oxygen Dilution (MILD) thermal oxidizers and combustion ow eld control technologies to reduce NOx emissions by 65% each year.

Note: Figures from TSMC fabs in Taiwan, TSMC (China), TSMC (Nanjing), and VisEra.

In compliance with TSMC Environmental Policy, the Company is dedicated to reducing air pollution emissions.

The Environmental Lab has strengthened pollutant monitoring and management for stacks, using baseline management to control the concentration of air pollutants, achieve source reduction and enhance the performance of prevention facilities.

In 2022, 104 stacks exceeding baseline concentration standards have been mitigated by the decontamination method, including replacing terminal prevention facilities that have reached the end of their life cycles, upgrading existing facilities, or introducing new high e ciency facilities.

For air pollution sampling, the Environmental Lab introduced various sampling and analysis technologies according to the demands and regulatory requirements.

In 2022, the Lab developed ways to analyze inorganic acids, ammonia, heavy metals, NMHCs, etc., to increase the facilities' abilities for di erent pollutants identi cation, provide sampling data more rapidly, and shorten mitigation period.

The Lab further traced air pollution sources by sampling central scrubber exhaust ducts to con rm the source of abnormal exhaust gas emissions.

Then, TSMC can investigate upstream process tools to clarify special gases and emission properties for ensuring the coverage rate of local scrubber installation is su cient.

The Lab also veri es the performance of upgraded local scrubber, ller variance, and optimal parameters.

This allows facilities to rapidly develop optimal treatment for target pollutants.

In 2022, 2,282 exhaust ducts, sub ducts, and equipment units were sampled and tested 16 cases of mixed acid and alkaline gas emissions were found and resolved, and improved performances in 15 treatment facilities were veri ed.

For water quality testing, the Environmental Lab provided the analyzation for 29 items of pollutants in scrubber water.

The result showed that water containing acid base ions could be turned into gaseous pollutants at certain pH levels.

In 2022, the Environmental Lab established E uents and Water Quality Management for Scrubbers to regularly inspect water status to ensure air pollution control equipment operates at the optimal levels.

TSMC is strengthening the reliability of air pollution control equipment operating systems and air pollution monitoring to ensure compliance with Taiwan and overseas regulations.

The Company also deployed automatic monitoring systems total hydrocarbon monitors, online IPA monitors, and online uorine gas monitors to rigorously control monitoring data and actual emission levels.

In addition, the Facility Division, Industrial Safety and Environmental Protection Division, and Instrument Control System Division used Automatic System for Legal Air Pollutant Coe cient Upgrades and Inspection, Facility Parameter Change Management System, and Facility Monitoring and Data Collection System to monitor facility parameters.

The systems automatically compare and inspect data to prevent aws or losses from human error.

This e ectively increases the accuracy and reliability of TSMC reports to government agencies.

In addition, to ensure air pollution treatment facilities remain at optimal e ciency for operations all year round, all control equipment is equipped with a Dual track Independent Monitoring System that allows the Facility Division and Industrial Safety and Environmental Protection Division to perform emergency repairs or initiate backup systems to minimize damages and losses.

TSMC also adopts the N 1 rule where all equipment must have at least one backup system and uses Uninterrupted Power Supply Systems to help ful ll the management target of zero failure in control equipment.

With dedicated e orts from various divisions, TSMC is proud to report zero abnormal occurrences in air pollution control equipment in 2022.

With the evolution of advanced processes, TSMC continues to work with suppliers to optimize the performance of air pollution prevention equipment and has applied Wet Electrostatic Precipitator (wet EP) Scrubbers in the process which used high temperature sulfuric acid for cleaning.

As this process simultaneously uses acids, alkaline, and organic chemicals, it produces large amounts of acid alkaline gases and high concentration PM2.5.

TSMC improved on wet EP corona technologies to ensure safety and enhance the e ectiveness of air pollution treatment, changing electricity discharge mode and installing protective mechanisms.

The improved technology has obtained SEMI S2 safety certi cation and, after repeated testing, can be used for three stage pollutant treatment.

The rst stage is a washer that transmits gaseous acid alkaline liquid phases for decontamination.

The second stage is a particle collector that accumulates and removes particulate matter with corona discharge.

Finally, the gases which have been treated by wet EP would enter to the zeolite rotors for organic pollutant removing.

The three stage process can e ectively minimize acid alkaline gases, organic gases, and PM2.5 emissions simultaneously.

Results showed that the three stage process was able to remove 90% of alkaline gases, and 91% of PM2.5 which is the form of acid gases after reaction.

In the future, TSMC will continue to evaluate the feasibility and e cacy of wet EP applications to other exhaust gases to reduce air pollution emissions and strive toward zero emissions.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and per uorinated compounds (PFCs) are byproducts of wafer manufacturing.

Air pollution control equipment mainly uses pyrolysis to remove VOCs and PFCs.

However, this process also causes dinitrogen (N2) to react with oxygen (O2) in the air and produce nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) pollutants.

TSMC has launched a NOx reduction project in all facilities around the world to comply with assessment requirements for the new U.S. facility.

First, TSMC conducted survey and analysis for comprehensive stacks in the facilities.

Results showed that NOx is mainly produced by pyrolysis in local scrubbers and VOC control equipment.

To reduce NOx emissions, TSMC adapted the structure and treatment processes of thermal oxidizers in control equipment, adding swirler to introduce outside air into oxidizers to facilitate combustion.

Fuel sprinklers are also added for pre heating in stages.

In the rst stage, the oxygen concentration is be lower in the low temperature reaction.

In the second stage, the air with low oxygen concentration is introduced into the combustion.

Under the low oxygen combustion, ame temperature dip from 1,600 1,300 are used to change where exhaust gases enter into thermal oxidizers so that the gases can circumvent high temperature zones, which reduces the production of thermal NOx.

In 2022, TSMC tested the new process on VOC control equipment in the Fab 18 Phase 7 and was able to minimize target pollutants and NOx byproducts by simply adapting thermal oxidizers and using optimal temperatures.

The process does not compromise the performance of exhaust gas treatment and can reduce NOx emissions by 65% each year.

TSMC will continue to evaluate ways to improve local scrubbers to further reduce NOx production and strive for environmental friendly goals.

TSMC values its commitment to employees and works to foster a humanistic workplace culture with open communications.

The Company is dedicated to promoting a diverse, inclusive, safe, and fun workplace where employees can continue to learn.

Note 3: Hazard Identi cation and Assessment: Foster a safety culture where employees and the Company protect each other and encourage employees to speak up and o er suggestions for occupational safety.

Following the TSMC Safety and Health Policy, TSMC has implemented the following health and safety measures and used the Safety Performance Index (SPI) to track performance.

TSMC has strengthened employees' safety and health awareness through training, hoping to minimize the impact of unsafe environments or conduct.

An analysis of employee disabling injury statistics reveals that most injuries are caused by insu cient safety awareness and failure to implement management regulations.

To enhance safety culture, experts were commissioned to conduct a safety culture investigation in 2022, helping to identify the direction and improvement measures.

Safety culture is the consensus among workers on safety awareness, emphasis, and belief in the workplace, and it is also the foundation of a safe and healthy workplace.

In 2022, TSMC commissioned a professional international safety culture consulting rm to design a questionnaire based on four aspects: teamwork, safety communication, safety values, and organizational trust.

Focusing on plants with a disabling injury frequency rate and a disabling severity rate that have fallen below the Company average for three consecutive years, a frontend wafer processing plant and a backend chip packaging plant were chosen via sampling.

The survey targets included colleagues of production and non production units, covering di erent genders, age groups, seniorities, and grades a total of 2,568 questionnaires were sent out, and 1,776 valid questionnaires were retrieved, resulting in a response rate of 69.2%.

According to the analysis outcome, TSMC's safety culture was given a score of 4.8 points, indicating the Company is transitioning from being compliant to incorporating safety awareness into our values .

The top three topics of concern among the colleagues were intrinsically safe work environment, comprehensive and transparent safety related reporting procedures, and a team culture of looking out for each other .

The most recognized measures were feeling the management's high level of safety concern, quick adoption of improvement measures, ongoing work environment optimization, and understanding the importance of employees' physical and mental health The least satis ed aspects were the supervisor fails to proactively communicate safety related topics, the employees believe that they do not have the proper ability to cope with management related contingencies, the Company is advised to provide more safety awareness training.

To respond to the colleagues' topics of concern, the emphasis in 2023 will be placed on reinforcing employees' day to day safety awareness, safety communication, and developing diverse safety awareness training.

Corporate ESH Division will identify potential risks in the workplace and design bespoke safety and health training programs design Safety Moment programs to train seed personnel from various units publish new safety related knowledge every month to elevate everyone's safety awareness demand various departments to hold monthly workplace safety and health related problem discussions, where the seed personnel will report improvement suggestions back to the Corporate ESH Division in a bid to establish a company wide safety culture.

TSMC Safety Performance Index (SPI) is classified into four levels, including active and passive indices.

The active indices encourage employees to participate in health and safety activities while the passive index shows the number of safety related failures, false alarms, etc.

To implement the improvement measures for the prevention of false alarms, if the same false alarm occurs repeatedly in the same year, additional points will be deducted from the SPI.

In 2022, blue light indices (excellent) increased by 10.1% from 2021 to 86%.

The main improvement in the passive indices was reflected in the decrease in false alarms from 28 incidents in the previous years to 17 incidents this year, and the incident rate per 1,000 employees was reduced to 0.145 from 0.252 in 2021.

When a false alarm occurs, in addition to applying the 3L5W (Three Legged Five Whys) Tool to conduct an investigation, the Company also interviews relevant personnel, analyzes and inspects the equipment, and tests the materials using the false alarm reporting and investigation procedure.

Relevant documents and records are checked, or the scene is reconstructed to identify the direct, indirect, and fundamental cause of the incident to actively discover improvement opportunities and prevent similar incidents from occurring again.

Note: Starting from 2020, the incident rate per thousand individuals entering TSMC includes employees and contractors.

Note: Historical incidents by type per thousand individuals entering TSMC include employees and contractors.

Three incidents were caused by damaged gas early warning alarm components, and three incidents were caused by workers who did not observe the gas cylinder replacement procedures.

Construction site safety management is conducted through the three strategies of risk identi cation, management support, and execution review.

The digital transformation of occupational safety and health training is implemented, where relevant programs are launched by the TSMC Supplier Sustainability Academy.

In particular, high risk operation contractors must complete 100% of the training before entering the fabs to begin construction.

The safety design of the cleaning tank must include low liquid level detectors and overheat detectors that are not controlled by the process.

When the detectors are activated, they should be able to automatically turn o the heater when the overheat detector circuit is open and faulty, it should be regarded as an alarm, and the heater is automatically turned o .

To enhance the implementation of the construction personnel's safety regulations, minimize inattention related occupational disasters, and improve inspection manpower allocation and time consuming problems, TSMC has joined forces with National Chung Hsing University's Department of Management Information Systems in 2021 to develop Arti cial Intelligence (AI) Job Hazard Analysis Technology, integrating existing emergency response 4G cameras in the fabs with a wired or wireless network to transmit live images, apply intelligent identi cation technology to identify environmental and operational risks, as well as integrate big data computing and machine learning to monitor high risk workplaces.

The Emergency Response Center personnel can monitor safety blind spots via live images around the clock.

When construction workers operating in high risk areas exhibit unsafe behaviors or nd themselves in an unsafe environment, text messages or the public address system can be used to report the problem to TSMC project managers and Emergency Response Center, demanding the contractor to make immediate improvements.

The contractor may only resume construction after it has passed re inspection.

In 2022, the AI job hazard analysis technology was used in Fab 15A to monitor 1,402 ceiling operations, where three unsafe contractor behaviors were discovered in time during the test process to prevent occupational injuries.

Besides the ceiling, AI job hazard analysis technologies will be developed for other high risk workplaces.

The technology will be introduced to various fabs, and it will be standard equipment for new fabs.

Considering the diverse applications of AI technology, TSMC formed an internal image recognition development and review platform in 2022 to consolidate all AI image recognition system developments.

Units with image recognition needs can search and utilize the application resources that have already been developed on this platform to expand the scope and depth of disaster prevention technology.

Disclosure of occupational accidents is based on the Occupational Safety and Health Act and important disabling injury indicators issued by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which uses Disabling Severity Rate (SR) and Disabling Injury Frequency Rate (FR) as primary indicators.

In 2022, there were 35 disabling injuries among employees with 385 workdays lost.

Of these, 21 cases of disabling injuries among men resulted in the loss of 251 workdays, and 14 cases of disabling injuries among women resulted in the loss of 134 workdays.

Men su ered from a higher number of work related disabling injuries and workdays lost than women.

The types of injuries were mostly falls and impact injuries, mainly caused by accidental collisions due to poor route design or failure to pay attention to people in front when using trolleys or tripping injuries caused by the improper placement of materials when conducting machine maintenance operations.

Mostly caused by colleagues using trolleys in the 6 and 8 fabs.

Therefore, trolley routes and placement locations continue to be planned according to the operations involved, re ectors are installed in areas prone to collisions, and colleagues who voluntarily report incidents are rewarded.

Unsafe environments were improved and quarterly communication meetings were conducted in the manufacturing department to promote preventive safety awareness using di erent themes.

Mostly caused by missing a step in the clean room or tripping over objects during machine maintenance.

Consequently, the 6S standard for maintenance processes has been formulated, including guidelines for placing relevant components, materials, and covers during machine maintenance, as well as rules for xing extension cords and trolleys.

Note: Data includes TSMC fabs in Taiwan, TSMC (China), TSMC (Nanjing) injuries, disabilities, or deaths of workers caused by buildings, machinery, equipment, raw materials, materials, chemicals, gases, vapors, dust, etc., at the place of duty, or as a result of work activities, or due to other occupational causes.

In 2022, the contractor disabling injury frequency rate (FR) and disabling severity rate (SR) were higher compared to 2021.

This was mostly attributed to unsafe behaviors such as a lack of safety awareness or failure to follow SOPs.

Please refer to the Safety Performance Index for relevant improvement measures.

TSMC's comprehensive health management encompasses worker health promotion, health check ups, care, and occupational disease prevention.

These measures aim to control the work environment and personnel health risks to attain a work life balance.

To protect the physical and mental health of employees, TSMC has hired professional medical sta including 2 physicians, 122 nurses, and 7 psychologists in the fabs in Taiwan and China.

A total of 1,743 services were provided by contracted labor health physicians.

Held online health walk challenges and weight control competitions, which saw the participation of 15,260 and 6,693 people, respectively.

According to the World Health Organization's statistics on the top ten causes of death, cerebrovascular diseases, heart diseases and cancer are the primary causes of disability and death.

To enhance employees' health care, besides implementing health checks that comply with laws and regulations in TSMC fabs in Taiwan and Nanjing, the Company also collaborated with hospitals in 2022 to provide employees with advanced imaging examinations for cerebrovascular disease, heart disease, cancer (intestine lung breast), and other diseases by applying a standard that is superior to regulations, hoping to adopt a more proactive approach to detect abnormalities in advance and assist employees to receive early treatment.

Moreover, the inspection results are combined with personal work hazards and applied to the physical and mental health management plan to actively mitigate employees' health risks.

In 2022, 46,672 people received health check ups, and for those who have abnormal results, all immediate assisted them back to hospitals for recheck and further treatment.

In 2022, TSMC's safety and health management measures were extended to all workers including employees, contractors, suppliers, and construction site contractors.

Furthermore, two major measures Environmental Safety Protection and Labor Physical and Mental Care were implemented for work sites.

First of all, technological tools were introduced to manage construction site safety and address environmental risks, and prevent personnel from being exposed to unsafe environments.

Second, the emphasis is on people, where health and screening services have been extended to construction sites, and a care group has been formed to protect the safety and health of contractors in the fab construction.

Use the health management system for high risk construction groups to identify personnel with high health risk.

TSMC remains committed to building a safe and healthy workplace where each task is assessed repeatedly through risk identi cation.

Furthermore, the Company collaborates with occupational disease physicians and external experts by following the disk identi cation method to uncover ve major potential risk factors of occupational diseases (chemical, physical, ergonomic, biological, and social mental) and design preventive measures accordingly.

In total, 11,939 employees in the Taiwan fabs received advanced imaging examinations, of which 1,997 were classi ed as moderately or highly abnormal.

Employees were helped to receive re examination and health education based on the degree of their abnormality.

Of these, 508 people who refused re examination were given health guidance via physician interviews, telephone interviews, or written reviews.

Furthermore, 55 people were required to limit work hours or adjust work content according to the doctor's order, and work distribution has been facilitated.

Work hours of employees were tracked every month to manage 6,212 people with medium high health risks, and make sure that they comply with the doctor's orders.

Health guidance was arranged for 1,757 people through approaches such as doctor's interviews, telephone interviews, or written reviews.

In total, work hours or work content adjustment was implemented for 216 persons.

As a leader in the global semiconductor industry, TSMC continues to collaborate with business partners, industry, and academia, hoping to create a sustainable, healthy workplace and minimize occupational risks.

In 2022, TSMC attended the Joint Steering Committee ESH Working Group of the World Semiconductor Council on behalf of the semiconductor industry in Taiwan to exchange information on safety and health related risk control measures with various industry players, sharing experiences on the use of chemicals with health risks such as Per and poly uoroalkyl substances (PFAS) or N methylpyrrolidone (NMP), and their substitutes.

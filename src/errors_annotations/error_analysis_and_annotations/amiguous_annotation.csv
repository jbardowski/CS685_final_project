"In addition, we have joined the Science Based Targets initiative and the Climate Pledge, committing to net zero emissions by 2040 .",ambiguous,specific
"The program is showing signs of success 10 suppliers that we sponsored, who successfully completed the program, have since set or committed to setting their own SBTi approved emissions targets.",ambiguous,specific
"As we continue to invest in renewable energy, several sites are using solar photovoltaics as an important strategy lever for reducing emissions and managing cost.",ambiguous,specific
"If the organization spends a majority of their efforts on these communities, we count the entire grant, and if the organization does not spend a majority, we count a proration of the grant.",ambiguous,specific
"We have worked with material and chemical suppliers to trial DMFa alternatives, and are impressed by the amount of innovation in this space.",ambiguous,specific
"The table below provides examples of the climate risks and opportunities identified over the short, medium and long term as well as our approach and mitigating actions that support our overall climate commitments and targets.",ambiguous,specific
"In FY22, we strengthened existing partnerships with third party experts who help suppliers address the root causes of non compliance though remediation and training programs.",ambiguous,specific
"In 2021, the Board of Directors defined TotalEnergies’ ambi tion and 2030 objectives for sustainable development and the energy transition toward net zero, together with society, and presented them to our shareholders so they could voice their opinion.",ambiguous,specific
"In the near term, NIKE intends to focus on cotton and polyester supply chains to reduce our dependence on higher impact versions of important fabrics.",ambiguous,specific
